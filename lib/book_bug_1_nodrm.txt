爱情与金钱

你是一名不错的侦探，是吗？如果是的话，那你得比沃尔什探长先找出凶手。沃尔什探长是名警探，他工作虽说慢了点，可十分细心。你是位“快手”吗？

侦探是干什么的呢？侦探就是寻找线索的人。而线索就是告诉你谁是凶手的重要但又细小的事物。发现线索不容易，但本故事中有许多线索。有些线索有用——它们能帮助你，可有些线索却不利——它们妨碍你找到凶手。你得仔细点读，否则你会错过线索。

但请记住：你不必相信人们说的每件事。凶手显然会撒谎，可能其他人因不同的理由也会撒谎。也许他们希望某人死去。但是谁希望呢？谁杀的？你能找出凶手吗？

罗伊纳·阿金耶米是英国人，但在非洲度过了许多年。本书是她为英语学生写的第一部故事。

Chapter

The Clarkson family lived in the country near Cambridge, about half a mile from the nearest village and about a mile from the river. They had a big, old house with a beautiful garden, a lot of flowers and many old trees.

One Thursday morning in July, Jackie came in from the garden. She was a tall, fat woman, thirty years old. It was the hottest day of the year, but she wore a warm brown skirt and yellow shirt. She went into the kitchen to get a drink of water. Just then the phone rang.

'Cambridge 1379,' Jackie said.

'Hello. This is Diane. I want to talk to Mother.'

'Mother isn't here,' Jackie said. 'She's at the doctor's.'

'Why? What's wrong?'

'Nothing's wrong,' Jackie said. 'Why are you telephoning? You are going to come this weekend? Mother wants everyone to be here.'

'Yes, I want to come,' Diane said. 'I'm phoning because I have no money for the train ticket.'

'No money! Mother is always giving you money!'

'This phone call is very expensive,' Diane said coldly. 'Tell Mother please. I need the money.'

Jackie put the phone down. She took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke. She felt angry because her sister always asked for money. Diane was twenty years old, the youngest in the family. She lived in London, in one room of a big house. She wanted to be a singer. She sang very well but she could never get work.

Jackie went back into the kitchen and began to make some sandwiches. Just then the back door opened, and her mother came in.

'It's very hot!' Molly said. She took off her hat and put it down on the table. She was a tall, dark woman with beautiful eyes.

Two big, black dogs came into the kitchen after her and ran across to her. She sat down and put her hands on their heads.

Jackie put the sandwiches on the table. 'Mother,' she said. 'Diane phoned. She wants money for her train ticket.'

Molly closed her eyes for a minute. Then she stood up. 'This afternoon I want you to get the house ready for the weekend,' she said, 'Oh, and please go to the village later and get my tablets.'

'Yes, Mother,' Jackie said.

Molly went to the door.

'Mother, please wait a minute,' Jackie said. 'Peter Hobbs came here this morning. He's very angry with you about that letter. He lost his job, you know. Why did you write to his office? He wants to talk to you about it.'

'Well, I don't want to talk to him,' Molly said. She opened the door.

'But Mother, you don't understand. He's seventeen, and it was his first job. He's very, very angry. He says... he says he's going to kill you!'

Molly did not answer. She went out of the room and closed the door.

克拉克森家住在剑桥附近的乡下，离最近的村庄约有半英里路，距离河边有1英里左右。他们有幢大而古老、并带有美丽花园的房子，花园里有许多花和许多古树。

七月的一个星期四早上，杰基从花园进了屋。她是个高大，肥胖，30来岁的女人。这是一年中最热的日子，而她却穿着暖色调的黄色衬衫和棕色裙子。她走进厨房去喝水，这时电话响了。

“剑桥1379号。”杰基说。

“你好！我是黛安娜。我想和妈妈说话。”

“妈妈不在家，”杰基说，“她看医生去了。”

“怎么了？出了什么事？”

“没什么，”杰基说，“你打电话干嘛？这个周末你回来吗？妈妈希望每个人都在。”

“是啊，我想回来，”黛安娜说，“我正因为没钱买火车票，才打电话。”

“没钱！妈妈总是给你钱！”

“电话费很贵，”黛安娜冷冷说道，“请告诉妈妈，我需要钱。”

杰基放下电话，她从包里拿了枝烟抽起来。她因她的妹妹总是要钱感到生气。黛安娜20岁了，在家里最小。她住在伦敦，在一所大房子里有间屋子。她想成为一个歌唱家，她唱得很棒，可是她却从来不愿找工作。

杰基走回厨房动手做一些三明治。这时候门开了，她的母亲走了进来。

“天太热了！”莫利说道，她摘下帽子放在桌上。她是位高个子，皮肤浅黑，有双美丽眼睛的女人。

两条大黑狗跟着她进了厨房围着她转，她坐下来把手放在它们的头上。

杰基把三明治放在桌上。“妈妈，”她说道，“黛安娜打来电话，她想要钱买火车票。”

莫利闭了一会儿眼，然后站起来。“下午我希望你收拾一下房子，为周末做准备，”她说，“哦，随后请去村里给我买些药片。”

“好的，妈妈。”杰基说。

莫利向门口走去。

“妈妈，请等一会。”杰基说，“彼得·霍布斯今早来了，他对你的那封信很生气。你知道，他丟了工作。你为什么写信给他的办公室？他想和你谈谈这事。”

“好啦，我不想和他谈，”莫利说道。她打开了门。

“可是妈妈，你不明白。他17岁了，那是他第一份工作，他非常非常生气。他说……他说他会杀了你！”

莫利没答话，她走出房间关上了门。

Chapter

It was seven o'clock on Saturday evening. Jackie stood at the window. A car drove slowly up to the front door and stopped. A tall man with white hair got out. It was Albert, the husband of Molly's sister.

'Here's Uncle Albert,' Jackie said. 'Always late.'

She went out of the room and opened the front door. Albert came in and went at once to Molly.

'Oh, dear. I'm very late. I am sorry,' Albert said. 'Fifty years old today! What a wonderful dress!'

Molly did not smile. 'Thank you, Albert. We're all getting older.' Tonight she wore a long black dress, and the two black dogs sat at her feet. 'Everyone is here now. Let's go in to dinner,' she said.

Everyone stood up and went to the table.

'The table looks nice, Jackie. What wonderful flowers!' Diane said. She was a beautiful girl, with long black hair and dark blue eyes. She wore a long red dress.

Albert sat down next to Roger. Roger was Molly's son, her second child. He lived in Cambridge, in an expensive house.

'Someone called Peter stopped me down the road,' Albert said. 'Who is he? He's very angry with you, Molly.'

'That's Peter Hobbs, from the house across the road,' Jackie said quickly. She looked across the table at Molly. 'He lost his job last week and he's angry with everyone.'

'It's Molly he doesn't like,' Albert said.

Molly said nothing. Everyone began to eat.

'How is Aunt Annie?' Jackie asked.

'She's much worse now,' Albert said. 'She stays in bed all the time. She needs a nurse twenty-four hours a day.'

'I am sorry,' Molly said.

Albert stopped eating and looked at Molly. 'It's very difficult and very expensive, you know. Annie feels very unhappy because you don't visit her, Molly. She loves you very much. You are her little sister, you know.'

Molly closed her eyes for a minute. 'I know that, Albert. I am fifty years old, but I am always her "little" sister. Well, we can talk about it later.'

Albert laughed. 'Oh yes, we can talk later. It's always later with you, Molly. Always tomorrow. Never today.'

Jackie watched her mother. Her mother was angry with Albert. Molly never liked talking about her sister Annie and she did not like visiting her because she was very ill.

'That's a beautiful dress, Diane. Is it new?' Jackie asked.

'Thank you, Jackie. Yes, it's new, and very expensive. I got it on Wednesday,' Diane said. She smiled at Jackie.

'All your things are expensive,' Jackie said. She remembered the phone call on Thursday about the train ticket.

'I don't like cheap things,' Diane said. 'And I'm going to need more money soon. I want to go to America. Can you help me, Roger?'

'Oh no,' Roger said. 'Nobody wants to help you, Diane. You don't like working, we all know that, but we all want you to get a job.'

Diane laughed. 'It doesn't matter, Roger. I don't need your help. Mother always helps me. Mother loves me best.' She suddenly smiled, a quick, beautiful smile. But her eyes were cold.

Jackie looked at her mother. Molly's face was white. Jackie did not understand. Was her mother afraid of Diane? Jackie wanted her mother to be happy today.

'Would you like some more meat, Uncle Albert?' Jackie asked. 'Roger, can you give everyone some more to drink?' Roger got up and began to give more wine to everyone.

'This is good wine,' he said.

Molly smiled for the first time. 'Yes, your father loved this wine. He often drank it.'

'Yes,' Albert said, and looked at Molly. 'Expensive, too.'

'Would you like to meet Mr Briggs this weekend, Roger?' Jackie asked quickly. 'He's the new man at the farm. He wants to meet you.'

'Briggs? Briggs?' Molly said, suddenly angry. 'Don't talk to me about that man. I don' t like him. He wants half my garden for his farm. He needs more land, he says. I don't want him in my house. He's always dirty and he has bad teeth.'

Jackie stood up and got her bag. 'Excuse me, I want a cigarette.'

'Cigarettes! Always a cigarette in your mouth,' Molly said. 'I don't like it. Cigarettes aren't good for you.'

Jackie began to smoke. She felt angry but she said nothing. She wanted her mother to be happy this evening, but it was very difficult.

Roger drank some more wine. 'Well, Mother, perhaps Mr Briggs is right. The garden is very big,you know,' he said. 'It's a lot of work for you. The house is big, too. You're fifty now. You need to be more careful.'

'Roger! I don't need a nurse, you know! I work in the garden every day; I feel happy there.' Molly stood up. 'I know you all want my money. You come here for a free dinner, you don't want to see me. You don't love me. You want my house, and my money. Well, you can all wait. Nobody is getting more money from me, not before I die!'

'Don't say that, Mother!' Jackie cried.

Molly walked across the room to the door. 'I feel ill now. I'm going upstairs to bed.'

Molly left the room. Nobody moved.

'One day I'm going to kill that woman,' Diane said quietly.

Roger looked at Diane but said nothing. Albert moved his head slowly up and down. 'Ill! She's angry, that's all,' he said. 'Molly always gets angry about money. Why can't she be good to her sister? Annie's going to die soon. Molly knows that.'

Jackie finished her cigarette and stood up. 'Would everyone like some coffee? Come into the kitchen and let's drink it there.'

星期六晚上7点。杰基站在窗前。一辆小车徐徐驶到前门停下来。一个白头发、高个子的男人下了车，他是艾伯特，莫利姐姐的丈夫。

“是艾伯特姨父,”杰基说，“他总是迟到。”

她走出房间打开前门。艾伯特走进来，立刻便走向莫利。

“哦，亲爱的，抱歉，我来得太迟了，”艾伯特说，“今天是你50岁生日！多漂亮的裙子！”

莫利没有笑。“谢谢你，艾伯特。我们都老了。”今晚她穿了一条长长的黑裙子，两条黑狗蹲在她脚边。“现在大家都到了，咱们吃饭吧。”她说。

大家都站起来走到桌前。

“餐桌看起来不错，杰基。多美的花啊！”黛安娜说。她是个美丽的女孩，有一头长长的黑发和一双深蓝色的眼睛，穿了一条红色的长裙。

艾伯特坐在罗杰的旁边。罗杰是莫利的儿子，她的第二个孩子。他住在剑桥一幢昂贵的房子里。

“有个叫彼特的人沿路拦住了我，”艾伯特说，“他是谁？他很生你的气，莫利。”

“那是彼得·霍布斯，家住在马路对面的房子里。”杰基很快地说，她看着餐桌对面的莫利。“他上周丢了工作，他生每个人的气。”

“他不喜欢的是莫利。”艾伯特说。

莫利一言不发。大家开始吃东西。

“安妮姨妈好吗？”杰基问。

“她现在更糟糕了，”艾伯特说，“她所有时间都待在床上，一天24小时都需要护士。”

“我真难过。”莫利说。

艾伯特停下来看着莫利。“你知道，这事非常麻烦并且要花很多钱。莫利，安妮因为你不去看她很不高兴。她非常爱你，你知道，你是她的小妹妹。”

莫利闭上了眼。“我知道这些，艾伯特。我都50岁了，可我总是她的‘小’妹妹。好吧，我们以后再谈这事。”

艾伯特笑道。“哦，是啊，我们以后再谈。莫利，和你总是以后，总是明天，从来不是今天。”

杰基看着母亲，母亲在生艾伯特的气。莫利从来就不喜欢谈论她姐姐，也不喜欢去拜访她。而她病得很重。

“这裙子真漂亮，黛安娜。是新的吗？”杰基问。

“谢谢，杰基。是的，新裙子，非常贵。我周三才买的。”黛安娜说。她冲着杰基微笑。

“你所有的东西都昂贵，”杰基说。她记起周四关于火车票的电话。

“我不喜欢便宜的东西，”黛安娜说，“我不久会需要更多的钱，我想去美国。罗杰，你能帮我吗？”

“哦，不行，”罗杰说，“没有人想帮你，黛安娜。我们都知道，你不喜欢工作，但是我们都希望你找份工作。”

黛安娜笑道。“没关系，罗杰。我不需要你的帮助，妈妈总是会帮我的，妈妈最爱我。”她突然笑了一下，一个转瞬即逝的美丽的微笑。可她的眼神却是冷冷的。

杰基看着妈妈，莫利脸色苍白。杰基不明白为什么。妈妈会怕黛安娜？杰基希望妈妈今天快快乐乐。

“艾伯特姨父，你还要些肉吗？”杰基问。，“罗杰，你能给每人再添些饮料吗？”

罗杰站起来动手给大家加了些酒。“这酒不错。”他说。

莫利第一次笑了。“是啊，你父亲爱喝这种酒。他经常喝。”

“是啊，”艾伯特看着莫利说，“这酒也非常贵。”

“罗杰，这个周末你想见见布里格斯吗？”杰基急忙问，“他刚来农场。他想见见你。”

“布里格斯？布里格斯？”莫利说，她突然生气了。“不要和我谈那个男人，我不喜欢他。他想要我把一半的花园当他的农场。他说，他需要更多的土地。我不希望他来我家，他总是脏兮兮的，还有一口坏牙。”

杰基站起来拿她的包。“抱歉，我想抽枝烟。”

“烟！你的嘴总是叼着烟，”莫利说。，“我讨厌烟，抽烟对你不好。”

杰基开始抽烟，她感到很生气，但她什么也没说。她想让妈妈今晚快乐些，可看来这非常难。

罗杰喝了好些酒。“好啦，妈妈，布里格斯先生可能是对的。你清楚，花园是太大了，”他说，“你要干许多的事，房子也太大了。你都50岁了，你需要更多的照顾。”

“罗杰！你明白，我不需要护士！我每天在花园里干点活，我会感到快乐。”莫利站起来。“我知道你们都想要我的钱。你们来这儿只为一顿免费的晚餐，不是想来看看我，你们不爱我。你们想要我的房子，我的钱。好吧，你们都等着。在我死之前，任何人都别想从我这儿得一点儿！”

“别这么说，妈妈！ ”杰基叫道。

莫利穿过房间走到门前。“我现在觉得不舒服。我要上楼睡觉了。”

莫利离开了房间，大家都没动。

“有一天我会杀了这女人。”黛安娜平静地说。

罗杰看看黛安娜，但什么也没说。艾伯特上下摇晃着脑袋。“不舒服！她生气了，就这样，”他说，“莫利谈到钱总要生气。为什么她不能对她姐姐好点？安妮不久就要死了，莫利知道这些。”

杰基抽完烟站起来。“每人都来点咖啡吧，到厨房去，咱们在那儿喝。”

Chapter

Early next morning the house was quiet. Suddenly there was a cry from the room next to Roger's, his mother's room. Roger opened his eyes and looked at the clock. It was nearly seven o'clock. He got out of bed and opened the door quietly. At the same time the door of his mother's room opened and Diane came out. Her face was very white.

'Roger! It's Mother! I brought a cup of coffee for her and I found her dead. She's dead...dead in her bed,' she cried. Roger went quickly to the door of his mother's room and looked in. The window was open but the room was warm. Molly was on the bed, one hand under her head. Roger went across to the bed and put his hand on her arm. It was cold. On the little table next to the bed was a hot cup of coffee and an empty cup.

'I'm going to call the doctor,' Diane said.

'She's dead,' Roger said slowly. His face, too, was white. 'Mother is dead!'

Diane walked across the room to the door. 'I'm going to phone the doctor,' she said again.

'Wait a minute!' Roger called. 'Let's tell the family first.'

'Family! Nobody loved Mother!' Diane went out and ran downstairs.

Roger slowly went downstairs after her and stood by the telephone.

'Dr Pratt, this is Diane Clarkson. It's my mother—she's dead. Can you come quickly?'

Diane put the phone down. 'It isn't true, Roger! Mother's dead! Daddy died last winter, and now Mother.' Diane began to cry.

'Don't cry, Diane,' Roger said. 'Let's go upstairs and tell Uncle Albert and Jackie.'

'No! You tell them! Nobody loved Mother. You aren't sorry. Look at you! You want her money. That's all.'

Roger suddenly wanted to hit Diane. 'Be quiet!' he said. 'What about you? You didn't love Mother. You wanted her money, too. Don't forget that!'

'It's true,' Diane said. 'Oh, I can't stay in this house. I'm going out. I'm going to the river with the dogs.'

'No,' Roger said. 'The doctor's coming and I want you here.'

Diane said nothing. She went into the kitchen and at once the dogs got up and came to her. 'Beautiful dogs! Daddy loved you and Mother loved you. Now I'm going to love you.' She opened the back door and went out with the dogs.

Roger did not move. He stood by the telephone. 'It's true,' he thought. 'I am happy about the money. I needed money, and now I'm rich. Things are going to be easier for me now. But Mother... why didn't I love her more? And now she's dead.' Slowly, Roger went back upstairs. He wanted to dress before Dr Pratt arrived.

Dr Pratt was a little fat man without much hair. He was the family doctor and he knew all the Clarkson family very well. He went upstairs at once and looked at Molly's body. He looked carefully at the cup of coffee and the empty cup on the table next to her bed.

'I'm sorry, Roger,' he said. 'Where is Diane? She phoned me.'

'She went out with the dogs,' Roger said. 'She was angry with me—angry with everyone.'

Dr Pratt said nothing for a minute. 'This is going to be very difficult. I'm going to phone the police, Roger.'

'Police! Why? What's wrong?'

'I don't know. Your mother wasn't ill. I saw her on Thursday and she was very well. Why did she die? I don't understand. I want to find out.'

Roger went across to the window and looked out at the garden. It was a beautiful summer morning. The sky was blue and the garden was green. It was all very quiet. His mother loved this garden. But Tom Briggs wanted the garden. And Roger wanted the garden, too. Roger felt worse and worse.

'Your mother took sleeping tablets,' Dr Pratt said. 'Did you know? On Thursday she had a new bottle of tablets, but I can't find it here in her room.'

'I didn't know,' Roger said. 'Very well. Let's go downstairs and you can phone the police.'

Roger went into the kitchen and made some coffee. Just then Diane came in with the dogs.

'Roger,' she said. 'Look, I'm sorry. I was angry and said some angry things.'

'It doesn't matter,' Roger said. 'Here you are, have some coffee. Dr Pratt is phoning the police. Did you know Mother took sleeping tablets? Well, the bottle is not in her room.'

'What? I don't understand.' Diane took the coffee and began to drink. Her eyes looked big and dark.

Just then Dr Pratt came into the kitchen. 'They're coming at once,' he said. 'Diane—I'm sorry about your mother.'

'Dr Pratt, I want to tell you about last night. Everyone was very angry...'

'Be quiet!' Roger said quickly.

'Diane never thinks before she opens her mouth,' he thought angrily.

Diane did not look at Roger. 'Last night Mother went to bed early because everyone...'

'Don't tell me,' Dr Pratt said. 'You can tell the police.'

Roger's face went red. Suddenly he felt afraid. 'The police are going to talk to everyone, and ask questions,' he thought. 'And they're going to want answers. It's going to be very difficult.' He finished his coffee and stood up.

'I'm going upstairs,' he said. 'I'm going to tell Uncle Albert and Jackie about Mother... and about the police.'

第二天清晨整幢房子静悄悄的。突然从罗杰房间旁边他母亲的屋子里传出一声尖叫。罗杰睁开眼看了看表，还不到7点。他下了床，悄悄打开门。正在这时母亲房间的门也打开了，黛安娜走出来，脸色惨白。

“罗杰！妈妈她，我端了杯咖啡给她，发现她死了。她死了……死在床上。”她哭道。

罗杰急忙走到母亲的门前往里看，窗户是开着的，可房间里很温暖。莫利躺在床上，一只手在她头下。罗杰走到床前把手放在她的手臂上，尸体已经冷了。床边的小桌上有杯热咖啡和一个空杯子。

“我打电话去叫医生。”黛安娜说。

“她死了，”罗杰慢慢地说。他的脸也变白了。“妈妈死了！”

黛安娜穿过房间走到门口。“我去打电话叫医生。”她又说。

“等会儿！”罗杰叫道，“咱们得先告诉家人。”

“家人！没有人爱妈妈！”黛安娜走出去跑下楼。

罗杰跟着她慢慢走下楼站在电话旁。

“普拉特先生，我是黛安娜·克拉克森。我的妈妈——她死了。你能尽快赶来吗？”

黛安娜放下电话。“这不是真的，罗杰！妈妈死了！爸爸去年冬天死了，现在妈妈也死了。”黛安娜开始哭泣。

“别哭了，黛安娜，”罗杰说，“咱们上楼去告诉艾伯特姨父和杰基。”

“不！你 去告诉他们！没人爱妈妈，你们不必内疚。看看你们！你们想要她的钱。不过如此。”

罗杰突然想揍黛安娜。“住嘴！”他说，“你自己呢？你不爱妈妈，你也想要她的钱，别忘了这点！”

“不错，”黛安娜说,“哦，我不能再待在这儿了。我要出去。我要带着狗去河边走走。”

“不行，”罗杰说，“医生就要来了，我想你留在这儿。”

黛安娜没说话。她走进厨房。狗立即站起来走到她旁边。“多漂亮的狗！爸爸爱你们，妈妈也爱你们。现在我会爱你们的。”她打开后门，带着狗走了出去。

罗杰没动，他仍站在电话旁。“不错，”他想，“我的确为钱高兴。我需要钱，现在我是富有了。事情现在对我来说更容易。但是妈妈……我为什么不多爱她一些呢？现在她死了。”罗杰慢慢地上了楼，他想在普拉特医生来前穿好衣服。

普拉特医生是个矮胖、头发稀少的男人，他是家庭医生，对克拉克森一家人都很熟悉。他立即上楼查看莫利的尸体。他仔细看了床边桌子上的咖啡和空杯子。

“抱歉，罗杰，”他说，“黛安娜在哪儿？她给我打的电话。”

“她带着狗出去了，”罗杰说，“她冲我生气，生每个人的气。”

普拉特医生沉默了一会。“这事非常难办。罗杰，我要打电话给警察。”

“警察！为什么？出了什么事？”

“我不清楚，你的母亲没病，我周四见到她身体很好。她为什么会死？我不明白，我想找出原因。”

罗杰走到窗前向外看花园。这是个美丽的夏天的清晨，天空蓝蓝的，而花园是一片绿色，一切都非常安静。妈妈爱这个花园，然而汤姆·布里格斯却打着这个花园的主意，并且罗杰也想要这个花园。罗杰觉得事情越来越糟。

“你的妈妈服了安眼药，”普拉特医生说，“你知道吗？她周四买了瓶安眠药，可是我在她的房间却找不到。”

“我不知道，”罗杰说，“好吧。咱们下楼去，你可以给警察打电话。”

罗杰走进厨房弄了些咖啡，这时黛安娜带着狗走了进来。

“罗杰，”她说，“嗯，我很抱歉。我冲你发火并说了些气话。”

“没关系，”罗杰说，“给，喝点咖啡。普拉特医生正打电话给警察。你知道妈妈服安眠药吗？唷，药瓶不在她的屋里。”

“什么？我不知道。”黛安娜端起咖啡开始喝。她的眼睛看起来又大又黑。

这时普尔特医生走进厨房。“他们马上来，”他说，“黛安娜——我为你妈妈难过。”

“普拉特医生，我想告诉你有关昨晚的事，每个人都非常生气……”

“别说了！”罗杰急忙说。

“黛安娜开口前从不经过大脑。”他生气地想。

黛安娜没理会罗杰。“昨晚妈妈早早就上床了，因为每个人……”

“不用告诉我，”普拉特医生说，“你可以告诉警察。”

罗杰的脸红了，他突然觉得有些害怕。“警察会找每个人谈话，问问题的。”他想。“然后他们会寻找答案，这事非常棘手。”他喝完咖啡站起来。

“我上去了，”他说，“我去告诉艾伯特姨父和杰基有关妈妈的事……还有报警的事。”

Chapter

The police arrived very quickly. There were a lot of them. Some of them with cameras went upstairs to Molly's room. Two detectives talked to Dr Pratt in the kitchen. The family waited in the sitting room. It was a hot day again and the windows were open. The dogs sat quietly at Diane's feet. Nobody talked. Jackie smoked. They waited for a long time. Suddenly the door opened and the two detectives came in.

'Good morning. I am Detective Inspector Walsh and this is Sergeant Foster.' The Inspector did not smile. He was a big man in an old black suit and a black hat and coat. He wore a coat because he always felt cold. 'Last night someone put sleeping tablets in Mrs Clarkson's hot milk. We are going to question everybody, and we need a room, please.'

Roger stood up. 'I'm Roger Clarkson. You can have my father's old office. Come with me, it's along here,'

The office was not a very big room, but there was a table and three or four chairs. Roger opened the window.

'I would like to talk first to your uncle, Albert King,' Inspector Walsh said. He took off his hat and coat and sat down behind the table.

'Of course,' said Roger and left the room.

Sergeant Foster waited by the door. He was a very tall young man with black hair and a nice smile. He was not very happy this morning because he usually played tennis on Sunday mornings. He was one of the best players at the Cambridge Tennis Club.

Albert came in and sat down.

'I'm going to ask some questions, Mr King,' the Inspector said, 'and Sergeant Foster is going to write it all down.'

Albert looked at his feet. 'Yes, yes. It's your job. I know that.'

'Tell me about last night,' Inspector Walsh asked quietly. 'You were angry with Mrs Clarkson.'

Albert looked at Inspector Walsh for the first time. 'Yes, I was. Everyone was angry. Roger was angry. Diane wanted money to go to America. Then there's a man called Tom Briggs... He wants half the garden for his farm. Molly is a rich woman. I need money because my wife Annie—Molly's sister—is very ill. I told Molly this.'

'What happened next?'

'Well, Molly was angry with everyone and went upstairs. We went into the kitchen for coffee. Jackie wanted everyone to go up and say good night to Molly. She lives here with Molly so she wanted Molly to be happy. At first Roger said no. He was angry and didn't want to see his mother.'

'And did you see Molly in her room?'

'Yes. I was tired and I went upstairs first. I went to Molly's room and asked her for money again. But no—there was no money for her sister.' Albert stopped and put his hand over his eyes.

Inspector Walsh watched Albert for a minute. 'Did you hear noises after you went to bed?'

'Everyone went into Molly's room to say good night, I think. Later, I heard someone... He—or she—went downstairs. That was about midnight.'

'Very well, Mr King. Thank you, you can go now.' Albert left the room.

Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head. 'What time is it? I'm hungry. We're learning a lot, but I need some coffee.'

'Shall I go to the kitchen?' Sergeant Foster asked.

'Oh, no. Later. Let's see Jackie Clarkson next.'

Jackie came in and sat down. She looked down at her hands and said nothing.

'We found the empty bottle of your mother's sleeping tablets in Diane's room,' the Inspector said suddenly. Then he waited. Jackie's face did not change and she said nothing. 'Tell me, did your mother get her tablets from the shop in the village?'

'Yes. My mother usually took a sleeping tablet every night so she needed a lot of tablets. Sometimes she got them from the shop, sometimes I did. On Thursday, I asked Peter Hobbs to get them. He lives in the house across the road, and he often goes to the village on his bicycle.'

'I see. Your mother wanted to stay in this house. How about you? Did you want to move?'

Jackie looked up for a minute and then down at her hands again. 'This is Mother's house. I loved my mother. She was good to me.'

'Did you see your mother in her room last night?'

'Yes, everyone did. Diane made hot milk and took it to Mother. She usually drank a cup of hot milk before she slept.'

Inspector Walsh put his hands behind his head. Jackie was very quiet. 'What did your mother say?'

Jackie opened her bag and looked for a cigarette. 'Can I smoke?'

'Of course. This is your house,' Inspector Walsh said. He watched Jackie. 'What did your mother say?' he asked again.

'She wanted to go downstairs again. She remembered the dogs—she wanted to get some dinner for them. I went to my room and she went downstairs.'

'What time was this?'

'I don't remember. About midnight, I think.'

'And the cup of hot milk?'

'It was on the table by her bed.'

'Did you need your mother's money?'

'No, Inspector. Money is not important to me. There are more important things,' Jackie said quietly.

'Well, your uncle Albert wanted money. Tom Briggs wanted the garden. You wanted nothing?'

Jackie finished her cigarette and looked up at the Inspector. Her eyes were suddenly angry. 'Don't forget Peter Hobbs. He lost his job because of my mother. He wanted to kill her, you know. And what about Diane? You found the empty bottle in her bag.'

Inspector Walsh listened carefully. 'We're going to question everyone, Miss Clarkson.'

Jackie said nothing for a minute. 'Would you like some sandwiches and coffee, Inspector?'

'Ah! Yes, please!' Inspector Walsh said warmly. 'I would like sandwiches and coffee very much.'

Jackie left the room. Inspector Walsh thought about her. Why was she suddenly angry? The room was quiet.

警察很快就到了，来了许多人，一些人带着相机上楼到了莫利的房间。两个侦探在厨房和普拉特医生谈话。家人在客厅等着。这又是个热天，窗户开着，狗安静地卧在黛安娜脚旁。没人说话。杰基抽着烟。他们等了很长时间。突然门开了，两名侦探走了进来。

“早上好。我是沃尔什探长，这是福斯特警官。”探长没有笑。他是个高大的男人，穿件黑色的旧衣服，披着件黑色外套，戴着顶黑色的帽子。

他总觉得冷所以穿了件外套。“昨晚有人把安眠药放在克拉克森太太的热牛奶里，我们会找每个人谈。劳驾，我们需要一个房间。”

罗杰站起来。“我是罗杰·克拉克森。你们可以用我父亲过去的办公室。跟我来，就在这儿。”

办公室不是很大，但有一张桌子和三四把椅子。罗杰打开了窗户。

“我想先和你的姨父艾伯特·金谈谈。”沃尔什探长说。他摘下帽子，脱掉外套，坐在桌旁。

“当然可以。”罗杰说着离开了房间。

福斯特警官等在门边。他是个高个子、黑头发，有着迷人微笑的年青人。他通常在周日早上打网球，因而今早他有些不高兴。他是剑桥网球俱乐部最好的队员之一。

艾伯特走进来坐下。

“金先生，我想问你几个问题，”探长说，“福斯特警官会把你说的话都记录下来。”

艾伯特看着自己的脚。“好，好的。这是你们的工作。我理解。”

“告诉我有关昨晚的事。”沃尔什探长平静地问，“你对克拉克森太太生气了。”

艾伯特这才直视着沃尔什探长。“是的，我生气了。每个人都生气了，罗杰生气了，黛安娜想要钱去美国。然后有个叫汤姆·布里格斯的男人……他想要一半花园当他的农场。莫利是个富有的女人。我需要钱，因为我的妻子安妮——莫利的姐姐——病得很重。我把这些告诉了莫利。”

“接着发生了什么？”

“嗯，莫利冲大家生气，然后她上了楼。我们进厨房去喝咖啡。杰基希望大家都上去对莫利道晚安。她和莫利住在一块，所以她想让莫利快乐些。开始罗杰不同意，他在生气，不想见他的妈妈。”

“接着你去莫利的房间见她了？”

“是的。我累了，就先上了楼。我去莫利的房间再次向她要钱。但是不行——她的钱没有她的姐姐的份。”艾伯特停下来，用手蒙住了眼睛。

沃尔什探长看了会艾伯特。“你上床后听到什么声音吗？”“我想，每人都到莫利的房间对她道了晚安。随后，我听到有人……他——或者她——下了楼。那时大概是午夜。”

“很好，金先生，谢谢。你现在可以走了。”艾伯特离开了房间。

沃尔什探长把手放在脑后。“几点了？我饿了。我们了解了不少东西，但我需要点咖啡。”

“要我去厨房吗？”福斯特警官问。

“哦，不，待会儿。咱们接下来见见杰基·克拉克森。”

杰基走进来坐下，她低头看着手一言不发。

“我们在黛安娜的房间发现了你妈妈安眠药的空瓶子。”探长突然说，然后他等了一下。杰基脸色没变，还是什么都没说。“告诉我，你的妈妈是从村里的商店买到药的吗？”

“对。妈妈通常每晚都要服一片安眠药，所以她要许多药片。有时她去商店买，有时是我去。周四我请彼特·霍布斯去买。他住在马路对面的那幢房子里，他经常骑自行车去村里。”

“明白了。你母亲想留在这幢房子里。你呢？你想搬家吗？”

杰基抬起头，过了一会儿又低下头看着自己的手。“这是我妈妈的房子。我爱我的妈妈，她对我很好。”

“昨晚你去她的房间见她了吗？”

“去了，大家都去了。黛安娜煮了热牛奶并端给了妈妈。她通常在睡前要喝杯热牛奶。”

沃尔什探长把手放在脑后。杰基很平静。“你的妈妈说些什么？”

杰基打开包找了枝烟。“我可以抽吗？”

“当然，这是你家，”沃尔什探长说，他看着杰基。“你的妈妈说了些什么？”他又问。

“她又想下楼。她想起了狗——她想给它们弄点东西吃。我走回我的房间然后她下了楼。”

“这时几点了？”

“我记不清了。我想大概是午夜。”

“那么那杯热牛奶呢？”

“在她床边的桌上。”

“你需要你母亲的钱吗？”

“不，探长。钱对我不重要。有比钱更重要的东西。”杰基平静地说。

“嗯，你的艾伯特姨父要钱，汤姆·布里格斯想要花园。你什么也不想要？”

杰基抽完烟抬头看着探长。她的眼里突然冒着火气。“别忘了彼特·霍布斯。是我妈妈使他丢了工作。你知道，他想杀她。还有黛安娜，你们在她包里发现了空瓶子。”

沃尔什探长仔细听着。“我们会对每个人提问，克拉克森小姐。”

杰基沉默了一会。“探长，你们要些三明治和咖啡吗？”

“哈！好，麻烦了！”沃尔什探长温和地说，“我非常想要三明治和咖啡。”

杰基离开了房间。沃尔什探长想，她为什么突然生气了？房里静悄悄的。

Chapter

After the coffee and sandwiches, Inspector Walsh called Roger Clarkson to the office. Roger came in and sat down. The Inspector began at once.

'Now, Mr Clarkson. Why was your mother angry with you last night?'

'This house is very big,' Roger said. 'It was a lot of work for Mother. I wanted her to move. But no, she loved this house and garden. She didn't want to move.'

'Tell me about your job, Mr Clarkson. Your mother is dead and now you're rich. Do you need money?'

Roger's face was suddenly afraid. 'What are you saying? I didn't kill my mother. I need money, that's true. A friend and I want to build ten houses here, in this garden. We can get a lot of money for them. So. I wanted Mother to sell this house. It's true. But Mr Briggs wanted half the garden, too, you know, for his farm.'

Inspector Walsh moved a pencil on the table. 'Tell me, what happened upstairs? You went to your mother's room?'

'Yes, I did. I wanted to say good night to my mother.'

'Did you talk about the house again?'

'Yes, I did. Again, she said no. She loved the house and didn't want to sell it.'

Inspector Walsh watched Roger for a minute. 'I see. We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets, Mr Clarkson, in Diane's room.'

Roger's face did not change. 'Oh? Someone put them there. Diane did not kill my mother, I know that. She found the body.'

'Very well. I would like to see Diane next.'

Roger got up and left the room.

Inspector Walsh stood up and put his hands in his pockets. He went to the window and looked out at the trees. Why was Roger Clarkson afraid? Was it important? He looked at Sergeant Foster.

'Tomorrow morning, go to Mr Clarkson's office—you have the name,' he said. 'Ask some questions about him, about his job, friends, money.'

Sergeant Foster wrote it down. 'Yes, Inspector.'

'A good day for tennis, Sergeant?'

Sergeant Foster laughed. 'Don't say that. It's not easy, you know. I don't like sitting here looking at the sun.'

Diane came into the room and sat down. She looked at Sergeant Foster and smiled. 'I saw you at the Tennis Club last month, I think. You play very well.'

Sergeant Foster's face went red. Inspector Walsh looked at him, 'Oh yes. A fast and exciting player is Sergeant Foster.' Diane smiled again at Sergeant Foster and his face went red der.

'Well, Miss Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh said, 'I want you to talk about last night.'

Diane stopped smiling. 'Oh, I can talk about last night. I can't stop talking about it. We were all angry. Mother went to bed early and I made hot milk for her. We were all in the kitchen, and Peter Hobbs came in. He nearly broke the back door down.' Diane stopped.

'Yes?'

'He was very angry about a letter. He wanted to kill Mother. Are you going to talk to him?'

'We're going to talk to everyone.'

'Good. Tom Briggs came into the kitchen, too. Are you going to talk to him?'

'I'm asking the questions, Miss Clarkson. When did you take the milk upstairs?'

'I went up after Roger.' She stopped for a minute. Then she began again. 'I didn't like my mother, Inspector. She killed my father, you know. Last winter, after Christmas, she drove the car into a tree and killed my father.'

Inspector Walsh watched Diane's face carefully. 'I see. So you wanted to kill your mother?'

Diane laughed. 'I wanted to kill her, but I didn't. I can tell you a lot of things about this family, Inspector. Everyone wanted Mother to die. Uncle Albert wanted her money for his wife, Annie. And then my brother. He needs a lot of money. He has an expensive house and an expensive car. And think of Jackie. Do you know that Jackie didn't like Mother? A long time age, a nice boy worked here. He was the gardener. Jackie loved him very much, but Mother said no. A gardener was not a good husband for a Clarkson girl!'

Inspector Walsh listened quietly. All this was very interesting but was it important? Perhaps. What a happy family the Clarksons were!

'We found the empty bottle of sleeping tablets in your room,' Inspector Walsh said quietly. He watched her face carefully.

Diane stood up suddenly, her face angry. 'What? I didn't put it there! I'm not going to listen to this!' She ran out of the room.

'Well, well, well,' Inspector Walsh said. 'She likes you, Sergeant. You need to be careful.'

Sergeant Foster laughed but his face went red again.

'Someone put sleeping tablets in Molly's hot milk,' the Inspector said. 'All the family were in the kitchen last night. Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs were there, too. One of them killed Molly.'

Inspector Walsh got his hat and coat. 'Come on. We need to talk to Peter Hobbs and Tom Briggs. Let's get some more coffee first. I'd like a sandwich, too. I'm hungry again!'

用完咖啡和三明治后，沃尔什探长叫罗杰·克拉克森到办公室，罗杰走进来坐下。探长马上就开始了提问。

“嗨，克拉克森先生，你母亲昨晚为何生你的气？”

“房子太大了，”罗杰说。“妈妈得干许多活，我希望她搬家。可是不行，她爱这所房子和花园，她不想搬。”

“克拉克森先生，告诉我有关你工作的事，你母亲死了，现在你富有了。你需要钱吗?”

罗杰的脸突然露出害怕的神色。“你在说什么？我没有杀我的妈妈。我需要钱，这是真的。我和一个朋友想在这儿的花园里建10所房子，我们能从中赚许多钱，所以我希望妈妈卖了房子，这是事实。可是布里格斯先生也想要半个花园当他的农场，这你是知道的。”

沃尔什探长在桌上摆弄着铅笔。“告诉我，楼上发生了什么事？你去你母亲的房间了吗？”

“去了。我想对妈妈道一声晚安。”

“你又谈起了房子？”

“是的，我说了。她又说不行，她爱这所房子，她不想卖掉。”

沃尔什探长看了罗杰一会。“明白了。克拉克森先生，在黛安娜的房间里我们发现了安眠药的空瓶。”

罗杰没变脸色。“哦？有人放的吧。黛安娜不会杀妈妈，我知道的，是她发现了尸体。”

“很好。下一个我想见见黛安娜。”

罗杰站起来离开了房间。

沃尔什探长站起来把手放进口袋。他走到窗前看着外边的树。为什么罗杰·克拉克森会害怕？这重要吗？他看着福斯特警官。

“明天早上，去克拉克森先生的办公室——你知道他的名字。”他说，“问些有关他的情况，工作、朋友、钱。”

福斯特警官记了下来。“好的，探长。”

“今天可是打网球的好天气啊，警官。”

福斯特警官笑道：“别说这个，你知道，这种天气可不容易遇到。我不喜欢坐在这儿看太阳。”

黛安娜走进房间坐下来，她看着福斯特警官并冲他笑。“我想，我上个月在网球俱乐部见过你，你打得很棒。”

福斯特警官脸红了。沃尔什探长看着他。“哦，是的。那位打得激烈、兴奋的球员就是福斯特警官。”

黛安娜又朝着福斯特警官笑，他的脸更红了。

“好了，克拉克森小姐，”沃尔什探长说。“我想请你谈谈昨晚的事。”

黛安娜收住了笑容。“哦，我可以谈谈昨晚，我的确是要谈谈。我们都生气了。妈妈早早就上了床，然后我端了杯热牛奶给她。我们都在厨房，随后彼特·霍布斯进来了，他几乎把后门给砸烂了。”黛安娜停住了。

“接着呢？”

“他对那封信很生气，他想杀妈妈。你会和他谈谈吗？”

“我们会找每个人谈。”

“很好。汤姆·布里格斯也进了厨房。你要和他谈谈吗？”

“克拉克森小姐，我提几个问题。你什么时候端牛奶上楼的？”

“在罗杰之后。”她停了一会，然后她又说。“我不喜欢妈妈，探长。你要知道，她杀了我父亲。去年冬天，圣诞节后，她开车撞着一棵树，害死了我父亲。”

沃尔什警官仔细看着黛安娜的脸。“我明白了，所以你要杀死你母亲？”

黛安娜笑了。“我是想杀她，但是我没干。探长，我可以告诉你有关这个家的许多事。每个人都希望母亲死。艾伯特姨父想要她的钱给他妻子安妮。还有我哥哥，他需要很多钱。他有一所昂贵的房子和一辆昂贵的轿车。再想想杰基。你知道杰基不喜欢妈妈吗？很久以前，一个不错的男孩在这儿工作，他是个园丁，杰基非常爱他，可是妈妈不同意。园丁对克拉克森家女孩来说可不是丈夫的合适人选！”

沃尔什探长平静地听着。这些都很有趣，可是它们重要吗？也许吧。克拉克森家以前是一个多么快乐的家庭！

“我们在你的房间找到安眠药的空瓶。”沃尔什探长平静地说，他仔细看着她的脸。

黛安娜突然站起来，她一脸怒气。“什么？我没有放在那儿！我不要听这些！”她跑出房间。

“好了，好了，好了，”沃尔什探长说，“她喜欢你，警官，你得小心点。”

福斯特警官笑笑，他的脸却又红了。

“有人把安眠药放在莫利的热牛奶里，”探长说，“所有人昨晚都在厨房。彼特·霍布斯和汤姆·布里格斯也在那儿。他们中有人杀了莫利。”

沃尔什探长戴上帽子穿上外衣。“走吧，我们需要和彼特·霍布斯和汤姆·布里格斯谈谈。咱们得先喝点咖啡，我还想要块三明治。我又饿了！”

They found Peter Hobbs under his car—an old green car. He got up slowly. He wore old blue trousers and a dirty orange shirt.

'We want to talk about Mrs Clarkson,' Inspector Walsh said.

'Oh, it's about her,' Peter said. He looked at the Inspector. 'I know she's dead. Someone in the village told me.'

'Why did you go to the Clarkson's house last night?'

'Jackie wanted me to come and see her brother, Roger. "You're angry," she said. "Come and tell Roger." I went to the house but nobody opened the door. So I made a lot of noise and then they opened the door. Old Mrs Clarkson wasn't there. But I told Roger. I told them all!' Peter hit the car with his hand. 'I wanted to kill that woman. I lost my job, my first job, because of her. Last month I was in trouble with the police and that old woman wrote to my office and she told them about the police. I wanted to kill her!'

'Take it easy!' Inspector Walsh said. 'What happened next?'

'Jackie gave me some coffee, but her brother didn't listen to me,' Peter said angrily. 'Then Tom Briggs came in. He wanted to talk to Roger, too. But Roger didn't listen to him. Jackie was very unhappy—she nearly cried. Then I went home. That's all.'

'I see. Now tell me about the tablets. You went to the village on Thursday?'

'Tablets? Oh, yes. I remember. Jackie wanted me to get her mother's tablets from the village. I go to the village on my bicycle—this car doesn't work.'

'Thank you, Peter. That's all.'

'That's all?' Peter laughed angrily. 'You're going to come back, I know that! I know the police!'

Tom Briggs' farm was about half a mile away, near the river. It was not a big farm, and the house was old and dirty.

'Not much money here,' Inspector Walsh said.

Tom Briggs was a young man, about thirty years old, with dirty hands and bad teeth. 'What's wrong? Excuse me, I'm eating my dinner,' he said.

'We can wait. Finish your dinner,' Inspector Walsh said. 'We want to ask one or two questions about last night.'

'Come and wait in the front room,' Tom said and opened the door.

Inspector Walsh looked at the things in the front room. There was an old black and white television, and some books on the table. There was a picture of a happy young girl with long brown hair on the table, too. Inspector Walsh looked at the picture for a long time. Who was the girl?

Tom Briggs came back into the front room.

'Finished?' Inspector Walsh asked. 'You know Mrs Clarkson is dead?'

Tom Briggs sat down suddenly on the nearest chair. 'What? How did she die? When did it happen? I was there last night.'

'She died last night or early this morning. What did you do last night?'

'Me? Why are you asking me? I went there to meet Mr Clarkson—Roger. I'm losing money on this farm and I need more land. I want half Mrs Clarkson's garden.'

'You went into the kitchen. What did you do next? Can you remember?'

Tom Briggs looked at Sergeant Foster and then back at Inspector Walsh. 'I remember it very well. All the family were in the kitchen. Peter Hobbs was there, too. I talked to Roger. He wants his mother to sell the house. But he wants the land. He doesn't want me to have it. But now Mrs Clarkson is dead. What's going to happen now?'

Inspector Walsh got up and took the picture of the girl from the table. 'Who's this?'

Tom's face went red. 'Who? Oh! That's a friend. It's not... It was a long time ago.'

The two detectives walked back to the Clarksons' house through the garden. It was beautiful, green and quiet. Inspector Walsh felt tired and hungry. Who killed Molly? He knew the answer now, but he needed to ask one or two more questions.

'Let's go, Sergeant,' he said, and put on his hat again. 'Tomorrow is a new day.'

他们在小车车底找到了彼特·霍布斯——一辆旧的绿色小车。他慢慢站起来，穿了条旧的蓝裤子和一件脏兮兮的桔色衬衫。

“我们想和你谈谈克拉克森太太，”沃尔什探长说。

“哦，谈谈她，”彼特说。他看着探长。“我知道她死了，村里有人告诉我了。”

“昨晚你为什么去克拉克森家？”

“杰基要我去见她的弟弟，罗杰。‘你生气了，’她说，‘来告诉罗杰吧。’我去了那儿但没人给我开门。所以我弄出很大的噪音，然后他们开了门。老克拉克森太太不在那儿。但是我告诉了罗杰，我全都告诉了他们！”彼特用手敲打着车。“我想杀了那个女人。我丢了工作，我的第一份工作，就是因为她。上个月我跟警察有些纠纷，那老女人就写信给我的办公室，说了有关警察的事。我想杀了她！”

“别激动！”沃尔什探长说，“接下来发生了什么事？”

“杰基给我咖啡，可她的弟弟没听我说，”彼特生气地说,“然后汤姆·布里格斯进来了。他也想和罗杰谈谈，可罗杰不听他的。杰基很不高兴——她几乎哭了。然后我就回家了。就这些。”

“明白了。现在告诉我有关药片的事。你周四去村里了吗？”

“药片？哦，是的。我想起来了。杰基要我从村里给她妈妈带些药片。我骑自行车去村里的——这辆车坏了。”

“谢谢，彼特。到此为止吧。”

“到此为止？”彼特生气地笑笑。“你们会回来的，我知道！我了解警察。”

汤姆·布里格斯的农场大约有半英里远，靠近河畔。农场不大，并且房子又旧又脏。

“这儿不值多少钱。”沃尔什探长说。

汤姆·布里格斯是个年轻人，30来岁，一双手很脏，还有一口坏牙。“出了什么事？抱歉，我正在吃饭。”他说。

“我们可以等，你去吃饭吧，”沃尔什探长说，“我们想问一两个有关昨晚的问题。”

“进来在前屋等吧。”汤姆说着打开了门。

沃尔什探长看着前屋的东西。屋里有一台旧的黑白电视机，桌上还有些书。一个棕色长发，充满快乐的年青女孩的相片也在桌上，沃尔什探长盯着照片看了好一会。这女孩是谁？

这时，汤姆·布里格斯走进前屋。

“吃完了？”沃尔什探长问，“你知道克拉克森太太死了吗？”

汤姆·布里格斯突然跌坐在最靠近身边的椅子上。“什么？她怎么死的？什么时候？我昨晚还在那儿。”

“她死于昨晚或是今天清晨。你昨晚干了什么？”

“我？为什么要问我？我去那儿见克拉克森先生——罗杰。我的农场在亏损，我需要更多的土地。我想要克拉克森夫人的半个花园。”

“你进了厨房，接下来干了什么？你能记得吗？”

汤姆·布里格斯看着福斯特警官，然后又回头看着沃尔什探长。“我记得非常清楚。所有他们家的人都在厨房，彼特·霍布斯也在。我和罗杰谈话，他想要他母亲卖了房子，可是他要地，不想让我得到。但是现在克拉克森夫人死了。将会发生什么呢？”

沃尔什探长站起来，拿起桌上女孩的照片。“这是谁？”

汤姆脸红了。“谁？哦！那是一个朋友。这不是……这是很久以前的了。”

两人穿过花园走回到克拉克森家。花园美丽，葱绿，宁静。沃尔什探长觉得又累又饿。谁杀了莫利？他现在知道了答案，可他需要再问一两个问题。

“咱们走，警官，”他说，然后戴上帽子。“明天是新的一天了。”

7Chapter

Chapter

On Monday morning Sergeant Foster went to Roger's office and asked some questions. And then he went to Albert's house and asked some more questions. Inspector Walsh sat in his office and telephoned. He made phone calls about Peter Hobbs and he made phone calls about Tom Briggs. And then he had some coffee and sandwiches.

At three o'clock the two detectives drove to the Clarksons' house.

'I would like to see everyone,' he told Roger.

Everyone came into the sitting room and sat down.

Inspector Walsh stood in front of the windows and looked at them, one by one. 'I want to talk to you. Someone killed Molly Clarkson. Someone put sleeping tablets in her hot milk and killed her. Nobody wanted to tell me the true story, but now I know the true story and I'm going to tell you.'

The two dogs came slowly into the room and sat down at Diane's feet. It was very quiet in the room.

The Inspector looked at Albert. 'Mr King, your wife is very ill and needs a nurse. You told me this. You didn't tell me about your house. You're selling your house next month because you need the money.'

Albert was angry. 'Last year I asked Molly's husband for some money, and he said yes. But then he died in an accident.'

'Accident!' Diane cried. 'That was no accident. Mother killed Daddy because she wanted his money!'

'Let's talk about you now, Diane,' said Inspector Walsh. 'You visited your mother every month and you took money from her. Last month she gave you money for your television. This month she gave you money for your telephone. Every month you told your mother: "It was no accident; you killed Daddy. I'm going to tell the police." Your mother was afraid of the police and so she gave you the money. But in the end she wanted to stop you. She told Dr Pratt. No more money, she told Dr Pratt on Thursday; and on Saturday she died. You took the hot milk to your mother—what did she tell you?'

Diane began to cry. 'I loved Daddy! He always gave money to me; he loved me. It was Mother—she didn't love Daddy and she didn't love me.' Diane stopped. The dogs got up and went to the door. 'It's true, I took a lot of money from Mother. On Saturday she told me—no more money. I wanted to kill her, but I didn't.'

The dogs came back and sat down again at Diane's feet.

Inspector Walsh looked at Roger. 'Mr Clarkson also needed money.'

Roger's face went red. 'Don't tell them! Please!'

'Mr Clarkson lost his job last month. He has no money. But he has an expensive house and an expensive car. He likes expensive things.'

His sisters looked at him, but Roger put his hand over his eyes. 'Don't talk to me!'

'It doesn't matter now!' Diane said. 'Mother is dead and we have a lot of money. You don't need a job.'

Roger's face went red again. 'Be quiet, Diane!'

'Now,' Inspector Walsh began again. 'Peter Hobbs is a very angry young man. Mrs Clarkson was not very nice to him. He got the sleeping tablets from the shop. But did he put the tablets in the hot milk? I think not. Tom Briggs wanted half the garden for his farm. He was in the kitchen that night. Did he put sleeping tablets in the hot milk? I think not.'

Suddenly it began to rain. For a minute everyone watched it through the window. Jackie took a cigarette from her bag and began to smoke.

'But someone wanted Peter Hobbs to come into the kitchen that night. She wanted everyone to see him, and listen to him,' Inspector Walsh said.

'She...? I don't understand,' Roger began, and stopped.

Inspector Walsh moved away from the window and sat down. 'I'm going to tell you the true story now. Miss Clarkson, you wanted Peter Hobbs to come to the house that night. He was very angry with your mother because of that letter. He said: "I want to kill her." And you wanted everyone to hear that. Why?'

Jackie's face went white. 'It's not true! What about Diane? You found the empty bottle in her bag!'

Diane stood up. 'In my bag? Jackie! What are you talking about?'

'Be quiet, please, and sit down,' Inspector Walsh said. He looked at Jackie. 'It's true: we found the bottle in Diane's bag. But how do you know that? We didn't tell you.'

'You did... before... you told me before!'

'No. We found the empty bottle in Diane's room . We told you that. You talked about Diane's bag; we didn't tell you. Sergeant Foster wrote it all down.' Inspector Walsh looked carefully at Jackie. 'A long time ago, you knew Tom Briggs. He was the gardener here and you loved him. But your mother didn't like him.'

Jackie put her hands to her head. 'No! No!'

'We found your picture—an old one—in Mr Briggs' house. You were younger then, and your hair was long. Last year Tom Briggs came back, and you wanted him. He loved you, too, but he had no money. He wanted the garden for his farm, he wanted money, he wanted you. But your mother said no. In the end, you wanted to kill your mother... and you did kill her. Your mother went downstairs to see the dogs and you put the sleeping tablets in her hot milk. Later, you put the empty bottle in Diane's bag.'

Jackie stood up. Her eyes were dark and afraid. 'You don't understand!' she cried. 'Mother gave me nothing... all those years. I wanted to be happy... to be with Tom. That's all. I love Tom, and he loves me. But Mother said no. Always no.'

Then she began to cry. Nobody looked at her.

Jackie left the house in a police car. Inspector Walsh watched and then walked slowly to his car. He felt tired and hungry. He stopped and looked back at the house.

'Well,' he said to Sergeant Foster, 'in the end, they got the money: Albert, Roger, Diane. They're all rich now. But are they going to be happy?'

He got into the car. 'Let's go,' he said. 'I'm hungry; I need a sandwich.'

星期一早上，福斯特警官去罗杰的办公室问了几个问题，然后他去艾伯特家，问了些别的问题。沃尔什探长坐在办公室打电话。他打电话找彼特·霍夫斯，然后又打电话找汤姆·布里格斯。接着他要了些咖啡和三明治。

3点钟，两名侦探开车去了克拉克森家。

“我想见见每个人。”他告诉罗杰。

大家都走进客厅坐下来。

沃尔什探长站在窗前轮流地看了每个人一眼。“我想和你们谈谈。有人杀死了莫利·克拉克森，有人把安眠药放在她的热牛奶里杀了她。没人愿意告诉我实情，但现在我知道了事情真相，我将会告诉你们。”

两条狗慢慢走进房间坐在黛安娜脚旁。房间里非常安静。

探长看着艾伯特。“金先生，你妻子病得很重需要一名护士，你告诉了我。你却没告诉我有关你的房子。因为你们需要钱，你们下个月就要卖掉房子。”

艾伯特生气了。“去年我向莫利的丈夫要钱，他答应了。可接着他死于一场事故。”

“事故！”黛安娜叫道，“那不是事故！妈妈想要他的钱，所以她杀了爸爸！”

“咱们现在谈谈你，黛安娜，”沃尔什探长说，“你每个月都来见你母亲，然后从她那儿要走钱。上个月她给你钱买电视，这个月她又为你的电话付钱。每次你都告诉你的母亲：‘那不是一场事故；你杀了爸爸。我要告诉警察。’你母亲害怕警察，所以她给你钱。但是最后她想阻止你。她告诉了普拉特医生，没有太多的钱了，她是周四告诉普拉特医生的。接着星期天她死了。你端热牛奶给你母亲——她跟你说了些什么？”

黛安娜开始哭。“我爱爸爸！他总是给我钱，他爱我。就是妈妈——她不爱爸爸，也不爱我。”黛安娜停住了。狗站起来向门口走去。“是真的，我从母亲那儿要了不少钱。我想杀了她，可我没有。”

狗回来又卧在黛安娜脚旁。

沃尔什探长看着罗杰。“克拉克森先生也需要钱。”

罗杰脸红了。“请你别告诉他们！”

“克拉克森先生上个月失业了，他没有钱了。可他有一所昂贵的房子和一辆车。他喜欢昂贵的东西。”

他的姐妹看着他，可罗杰用手捂住眼睛。“别对我说这些！”“现在没关系了！”黛安娜说。“妈妈死了，我们有很多钱，你不需要工作。”

罗杰的脸又红了。“住嘴，黛安娜！”

“现在，”沃尔什探长又开始说了，“彼特·霍布斯是个非常忿怒的年轻人，克拉克森太太对他不太好。他从商店里买到安眠药，可他会把安眠药放在热牛奶里吗？我认为不会。汤姆·布里格斯想要半个花园当他的农场。他那晚在厨房，是他放安眠药在热牛奶里了吗？我认为不是。”

突然天开始下雨了。好一会儿大家都看着窗外的雨。杰基从包里拿了枝烟，开始抽。

“可有人要彼特·霍布斯那晚去厨房。她想要大家都看见他，并听他说话。”沃尔什探长说。

“她……？我不明白。”罗杰说，然后又停住了。

沃尔什探长从窗边走过来坐下。“现在我将告诉你们事件的真相。克拉克森小姐，你那晚要彼特·霍布斯来家里。他因为那封信很生你母亲的气。他说：‘我要杀了她。’因而你想要大家都听到这话。为什么？”

杰基的脸变白了。“这不是真的！黛安娜呢？你们在她包里发现了空瓶子！”

黛安娜站起来。“在我包里？杰基！你在说什么？”

“请安静，坐下。”沃尔什探长说，看着杰基。

“没错，我们在黛安娜的包里发现了瓶子。可你怎么知道的？我们并没有告诉你。”

“你们告诉了……先前……你们先前告诉了我！”

“没有。我们告诉你，我们在黛安娜的房间发现了空瓶，但你说的是黛安娜的包，我们并没有告诉你。福斯特警官记下来了。”沃尔什探长仔细看着杰基。“很久以前，你认识了汤姆·布里格斯，他是这儿的园丁，你爱上了他，可你的母亲不喜欢他。”

杰基把手放在头上。“不！不！”

“我发现你的相片——一张旧的——在布里格斯家里。你比现在年青，头发长长的。去年汤姆·布里格斯回来了，你想得到他，他也爱你，可他没有钱。他想要花园当他的农场，他想要钱，他也想得到你。可你母亲不同意。最后，你想杀了你母亲……然后你真的杀了她。你母亲下楼去看狗，然后你把安眠药放在她的热牛奶里。随后，你把空瓶子放进黛安娜的包里。”

杰基站起来，她黑黑的眼睛带着恐惧。“你们不知道！”她大声道，“母亲什么也没给我……这么多年了。我想要幸福……和汤姆一起，就这些。我爱汤姆，他也爱我。可母亲不同意，总是不同意。”然后她开始哭，没人理睬她。

杰基走出房子上了警车。沃尔什探长注视着她，然后慢慢走向他的车。他觉得又累又饿,，他停下来回头看着那所房子。

“好了，”他对福斯特警官说，“最后，他们得到了钱：艾伯特，罗杰，黛安娜。他们现在都富有了。可他们会快乐吗？”

他上了小车。“咱们走吧，”他说。“我饿了，我需要块三明治。”

简　介

1561年，苏格兰还是个未开化的国家。当年轻的苏格兰女王从法国回到苏格兰时，起初，她的人民非常高兴见到她。她的丈夫——法国国王死了，现在，她需要一个新的丈夫。可是玛丽，这位苏格兰女王是个天主教徒，而当时大多数的苏格兰人都是新教徒。当时的英格兰女王——伊丽莎白一世也是位新教徒，在那个年代，人们都乐于为他们自己的教会而战，并不惜献出生命。

年轻的玛丽女王该嫁给谁呢？谁是她的朋友，谁是她的敌人？玛丽既美丽又聪明，她热爱生活，喜欢冒险，也热爱人民。或许，她爱的人太多了。人们说她“又狂又坏，认识她是危险的”。但那是真的吗？

1587年，玛丽坐在英格兰的福瑟临黑城堡里，疲惫又忧伤。现在她是伊丽莎白女王的囚徒，不久将被送上断头台，她拿起笔开始给她的儿子詹姆斯——现在的苏格兰国王写信。这就是她一生的故事……

提姆·维克瑞是位经验丰富的教师、作家。他在英格兰北部的约克镇上居住、工作。

1Fotheringhay

Fotheringhay

My name is Bess Curle, but this is not my story. It is the story of my lady Mary, Queen of Scots. She wrote the story, and then she gave it to me. I am going to give it to her son.

She began the story a week ago. It was January 1587, and we sat here in our cold room in Fotheringhay Castle, in the north of England. We couldn't see much from the window. One or two houses, a river, some trees, some horses, and a road. That's all.

The road goes to London, the home of Queen Elizabeth of England. Mary sat with her little dog in her hands and watched it, all day long.

No one came along the road. Nothing happened. I watched Mary, unhappily.

'Please, Your Majesty, come away from that window,' I said. 'It doesn't help. No one is going to come. Queen Elizabeth can't do it—Queens don't kill Queens.'

'Don't they, Bess?' Mary said. 'Then why are we here, in this prison? Why am I not free?'

'Why, Your Majesty? Because Queen Elizabeth is afraid of you.'

'That's right,' Mary said. 'She's afraid of me, and she hates me too. She hates me because I am beautiful, and she is not; because I had three husbands, and she never married. And because many people—good Catholic people in England, France, Scotland, Spain—say that I , Mary, am the true Queen of England, not Elizabeth. And Elizabeth has no children, so, when she is dead, my son James...'

She came away from the window and stood in front of me. 'James,' she said quietly, 'my son. Does he think about me sometimes? He was only ten months old when I last saw him. It is nearly twenty years...'

'Of course he thinks about you, Your Majesty,' I said. 'You write to him often. How can he forget his mother?'

'Then why doesn't he write to me?' Mary asked. 'Does he want me to stay here in an English prison?'

'No, of course not, Your Majesty. But—he has a lot of work, Your Majesty. He is the King of Scotland, and...'

'He is not the King of Scotland, Bess,' she said. 'Not before I am dead. Remember that.'

'No, Your Majesty, of course not. But perhaps people tell him things that are untrue. You know what people say. Perhaps—perhaps he thinks you killed his father.'

Mary's face went white. She was very angry, and for a minute I was afraid. She said: 'You know that's a lie, Bess. It is a lie! I did not kill James's father—I knew nothing about it!'

'I know that, Your Majesty. But perhaps James doesn't know it. He hears so many lies, all the time. He needs to know the true story. Why don't you write, and tell him?'

Mary sat down slowly. She looked old and tired. 'All right, Bess,' she said. 'Give me a pen, please. I'm going to write to James, and tell him the true story. You can give it to him when I'm dead.'

'Dead , Your Majesty? Don't say that. You aren't going to die.'

Her old, tired eyes looked at me. 'Yes I am, Bess. You know what is going to happen. One day soon, a man is going to bring a letter from Queen Elizabeth. And then her men are going to kill me. But before I die, I would like to write to my son James. I want to tell him the story of my life. So give me a pen, please.'

I gave her a pen. This is what she wrote:...

1 　福瑟临黑

我的名字叫贝斯·柯尔，但这不是我的故事。它是有关苏格兰女王玛丽夫人的故事。她写下了这个故事，便交给我。我将把它转交给她的儿子。

她开始写这个故事是在一个星期以前。那是在1587年的1月，我们坐在英格兰北部福瑟临黑城堡中的一间寒冷的屋子里。透过窗户，我们看不到多少东西，一两幢房屋，一条河流，一些树木，几匹马和一条路，仅此而已。

这条路通往伦敦——英格兰伊丽莎白女王的家乡。一整天玛丽都坐着，手里抱着她的小狗，两眼望着这条路。

没有人从这条路上走来，什么也没有发生。我望着玛丽，心里很悲哀。

“陛下，请您离开那扇窗户吧，”我说道，“那没有用。不会有人来的。伊丽莎白女王不能那样做——女王不杀女王的。”

“难道她们不会吗，贝斯？”玛丽说，“那我们为什么会在这里，待在这个监狱里？为什么我不能自由？”

“您问为什么吗，陛下？那是因为伊丽莎白女王害怕您。”

“对极了，”玛丽说，“她怕我，并且还恨我。她恨我是因为我漂亮，而她不漂亮；是因为我有三任丈夫，而她从未结过婚。还因为许多人——英格兰、法国、苏格兰、西班牙的好心的天主教教徒们说我玛丽才是英格兰真正的女士，而非伊丽莎自。伊丽莎白没有小孩，因此，她死后，我的儿子詹姆斯……”

她离开窗口走过来站在我的面前。“詹姆斯，”她平静地说，“我的儿子。他有时会想起我吗？我最后一次见到他时他才10个月大。都快20年了……”

“他当然会想您的，陛下，”我说，“您经常给他写信，他怎么可能忘记自己的母亲呢？”

“那为什么他不给我写信呢？”玛丽问道，“他想让我待在英格兰的监狱里吗？”

“不，当然不，陛下。可是——他有许多事要做，陛下。他是苏格兰国王，而且……”

“他不是苏格兰国王，贝斯，”她说，“我没死，他就还不是，记住这点。”

“是的，陛下，他当然不是。可是也许人们会告诉他一些不真实的情况。您知道人们会说什么。也许——也许他认为是您杀死了他的父亲。”

玛丽的脸一下子变白了。她很愤怒，那一会儿我真觉得害怕。她说：“你知道那是个谎言，贝斯。那是个谎言！我没有杀死詹姆斯的父亲——我对那一无所知！”

“我知道，陛下。可是也许詹姆斯不知道。一直以来他听了那么多谎言，他需要知道真实的情况。您为什么不写信告诉他呢？”

玛丽慢慢地坐了下来。她看起来又苍老又疲惫。“好吧，贝斯，”她说，“请给我一支笔，我这就给詹姆斯写信，告诉他真实的故事。我死后，你可以把信交给他。”

“死？陛下，不要那样说。您不会死。”

她看着我，眼神苍老而疲惫地说道：“不，我会死的，贝斯。你知道将会发生什么。不久的一天，会有一个人带来伊丽莎白女王的一封信。随后，她的人便会杀了我。但在我死之前，我要给我的儿子詹姆斯写信。我要告诉他我一生的故事。来，给我一支笔吧。”

我拿给她一支笔。这就是她所写的：……

2France

France

Dear James. Very soon I am going to die, and meet my God. Before I die, I want to write the true story of my life for you. Everything that I write here is true—I cannot lie to you, or to God. Please believe that, James. It's important to me.

My father died when I was one week old, so I was the Queen of Scots when I was a baby. At first I lived with my mother in Scotland, and then, when I was five, I went to France. My mother was French, but she stayed in Scotland, and died there.

I went to France to marry the King of France's son. His name was Francis, and he was one year younger than me. In 1559, his father died, so Francis was King. Then I was Queen of France, and Queen of Scotland too.

I was very happy in France. Francis, my husband, was like a little brother to me. I think he loved me, but he was very young, and he was often ill. And then, in 1560, he died. He was sixteen years old.

When he died I was very unhappy, and my life was very different. There was a new King and Queen, and I wasn't important in France, any more. But I was still Queen of Scots, so I came back to Scotland. When I arrived in Scotland, I was a young girl of eighteen. My mother was dead, and there was no one there to meet me. I walked off the ship, and I slept in a little house near the sea.

Next day, the Scots lords came from Edinburgh. They were pleased to see me, and for a week everyone was happy. People smiled at me and sang in the streets. I think everyone liked me. Then, that Sunday, I went to church.

James, my son, you are a Protestant and I am a Catholic. You are a good man, and you love God, but your church and my church are enemies. I was born a Catholic, and I am going to die a Catholic. I love God, too—I hope you understand that. I'm not going to change now.

That Sunday, people shouted angrily in the streets. 'Your Majesty,' said the Scots lords. 'Scotland is a Protestant country. You can't go to a Catholic church here. The Scottish people don't like Catholics.'

'I'm sorry, my lords,' I said. 'But I am your Queen—no one tells me what to do. I don't hate Protestants, and I'm not going to kill them. The people can go to their Protestant churches, and pray to God there. But I'm going to pray with Catholics, in my church.'

People were angry because of that. A man called John Knox came to see me. He was a famous Protestant churchman, but I didn't like him. He was a big, angry man with black clothes. He hated the Catholic church, and wanted all Catholics to leave Scotland. To him, the Protestant church was the only true church of God. He said: 'Your Majesty, you're a young woman, like my daughter. Women can't understand difficult things like God or the church. Find a good Protestant husband, girl. Let him rule this country for you.'

I was very angry with this man Knox. I was a Queen, but I was only eighteen. He didn't talk quietly—he shouted at me. I cried because of his angry words. I could not understand him—he talked so much, and he knew so many books. But I did not go to his church.

He was right about one thing. Perhaps I could rule Scotland without a man, but I could not have a child without one. And every Queen needs a son or daughter to come after her. So I began to look for a husband.

2 　法国

亲爱的詹姆斯，很快我就要死去，去见我的上帝了。在我死之前，我要给你写下我一生真实的故事。在这里我写的一切都是真实的——我不能对你说谎，也不能对上帝说谎。请相信这一切，詹姆斯，这对我很重要。

在我出生只有一个星期的时候我的父亲便去世了。因此在我还是个婴儿的时候我就成了苏格兰的女王。起初我和母亲一起住在苏格兰，后来在我五岁的时候我去了法国。我母亲是法国人，可是她却待在苏格兰，并且在那里过世。

我去法国并嫁给了法国王子。他叫弗朗西斯，比我小一岁。1559年，他的父亲去世了，因此弗朗西斯成了国王。于是，我既是法国王后，又是苏格兰女王。

在法国我很幸福。我的丈夫弗朗西斯就像是我的一个小弟弟。我想他是爱我的，但是他太年轻了，还经常生病。之后，1560年，他死了，年仅16岁。

他死后我非常伤心，而且我的生活也发生了很大的变化。法国有了新的国王和王后，我在法国已显得不再重要，但是我仍然是苏格兰的女王，因此，我回到了苏格兰。回到苏格兰的那会儿，我是个才18岁的小姑娘。我的母亲已经去世了，因此没有人来接我。我下了船，就在海边的一间小屋里过夜。

第二天，苏格兰的贵族们从爱丁堡来了，他们见到我很高兴。有一个星期大家都很开心。人们朝我微笑，在大街上唱歌。我以为每个人都很喜欢我。然后，在那个星期天，我去了教堂。

詹姆斯，我的儿子，你是个新教徒而我是个天主教徒。你是好人，且热爱上帝，可是你的教会和我的教会是仇敌。我生为天主教徒，死也是天主教徒。我也爱上帝——我希望你能理解这些。即使现在我也不打算改变。

那个星期天，人们在大街上愤怒地叫喊。“陛下，”那些苏格兰贵族们说道，“苏格兰是个信奉新教的国家。您不能去这里的天主教教堂。苏格兰人民不喜欢天主教徒。”

“很抱歉，我的勋爵们，”我说，“可我是你们的女王——没有人能告诉我该怎样做。我不憎恨新教徒，也不会杀害他们。人们可以去他们的新教教堂，并在那里向上帝祈祷。而我也将和天主教教徒们一起在我的教堂里向上帝祈祷。”

人们听到这些发怒了。一个名叫约翰·诺克斯的人来见我。他是个有名的新教教士，可我不喜欢他。他个头很大，怒气冲冲，穿着一身黑衣服。他憎恨天主教会，且想让所有的天主教教徒都离开苏格兰。对他来说，新教教会才是唯一真正属于上帝的教会。他说道：“陛下，您是位年轻女子，就像我的女儿。女人是不会懂得诸如上帝、教会这类艰深难懂的事情的。找一个新教徒的好丈夫吧，女孩，让他来为你统治这个国家。”

我对这个名叫诺克斯的男人很生气。我是女王，可我只有18岁。他没有平静地和我说话——他对我大声叫嚷。由于他措词严厉，我哭了。我无法理解他，虽然他说了那么多，并读过那么多书。但我不会去他的教堂。

可有一点他是对的。没有男人，或许我可以统治苏格兰，但没有男人，我就不会有小孩。每个女王都需要有个儿子或女儿来继承王位。因此我开始物色一个丈夫。

3Darnley and Riccio

Darnley and Riccio

At first I wanted to marry the son of the King of Spain, Don Carlos. But he was a Catholic, of course, and my Scots lords did not like that. It was difficult for me, James. I wanted to please myself. I wanted to please my friends and family in France and to please my people, too. And then there was the Queen of England.

At first I wanted very much to be friends with Elizabeth. We wrote many letters, and talked about a meeting—a meeting between two sister Queens. Elizabeth wrote to me at this time.

Our two countries need to be friends. You need a husband, I need a friend. Why not marry my friend Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester? He is a tall, strong man. I think he could be a good husband for you.

I was very angry about this letter. There were a lot of stories about Elizabeth and Robert Dudley. They were good friends—he often danced and sang and talked with her. Sometimes, people said, he stayed in her room all night. Dudley had a wife, but one day she died very suddenly. It was an accident—she fell down the stairs, they say. But then, perhaps she was unhappy, because of her husband and Elizabeth.

'And she writes to me about a man like this!' I thought. 'She wants him to marry me, because he is her friend—her lover, perhaps! She wants her lover to be King of Scotland!'

I found a better man than Dudley, James. I found Henry Darnley, your father.

He was nineteen years old, and I was twenty-three. He was a tall man, with a beautiful face and big green eyes. He talked and sang well, and I liked dancing with him. He often wore expensive black clothes, and he laughed a lot when he was with me. He was very young and friendly, and I felt happy when I was with him. I liked him very much, and I thought he loved me too.

He was an important man, too. We were cousins—his grandfather was King of Scots, and his great-grandfather was Henry Ⅶ of England.

In July 1565, I married him. Elizabeth was very angry, and so were a lot of the Scots lords. My half-brother, the Earl of Moray, tried to stop the marriage. I had to fight him, and he ran south, to England. But I was happy. Your father and I laughed, every day. He was now Henry, King of Scots.

After one or two weeks, the laughter stopped. A King has a lot of work, James, you know that. He has to read hundreds of letters, talk to people, and think about a lot of important things. I did those things, every day. But now, I thought, I had a man to help me.

'My lord Henry,' I said. 'Would you like to read all the letters with me? You can sit next to me, and you can work with me every day.'

Your father looked unhappy. 'I'm not interested in work like that,' he said. 'I don't understand it.'

'Of course not,' I said. 'You're a young man, my love. But I can teach you.'

For one or two days he sat down with me, and I tried to teach him. But it was true, he was not interested in the work, and he did not try to understand it.

'You do it, Mary,' he said. 'I'm going out with my friends. We're going to ride, and drink, and swim.'

So I did all the work. At night, too, he often went out with his friends in the town. They drank a lot, and laughed and sang, and there were often fights. But no one said anything, because he was the King, my husband. What could people say? They were unhappy, but they were afraid of him. Some of them went to England, to the Earl of Moray.

At this time I was often very tired, because I was pregnant. You, my son James, were alive inside me. But I did all the work of a Queen and I needed friends too. One of these friends was a young Italian, David Riccio.

Riccio was a little man and he was not tall or beautiful or strong. But he was a very clever, interesting man. He wrote many of my letters for me, and helped me. He sang well, too, and I sometimes sang with him in the evenings. I liked him very much, and at first, your father liked him too.

But then, Moray's friends began to talk about me and Riccio. 'David Riccio is in the Queen's rooms every night,' they said to your father. 'She laughs and sings and dances with him, my lord—it is not right! He is not a Scotsman, and he is not her husband. He is always with her.'

Perhaps they said other things, too—I don't know. A lot of Scots lords listened to them. But I tell you, James, before God, I did nothing wrong. David Riccio was a good man. He worked hard, and he helped me—so of course I liked him. Your father did not work—he went out to the town every night with his friends, and drank.

And then one night. your father came home.

3 　达恩利和里奇奥

开始的时候，我想嫁给西班牙国王的儿子，唐·卡洛斯。可他是个天主教徒。当然，我的这些苏格兰贵族们不喜欢那样。这对我太难了，詹姆斯。我想让自己愉快，又想让我在法国的朋友和家人高兴，也想让我的人民满意。此外，还有英格兰女王。

起初，我极想和伊丽莎白交朋友。我们通了很多信，并讨论有关会面的事宜——两位女王姐妹之间的会面。这时，伊丽莎白给我写信道：

我们两个国家需要成为朋友。你需要一个丈夫，而我需要一个朋友。为什么不嫁给我的朋友莱斯特伯爵罗伯特·达德利呢？他高大健壮，我想他会成为你的好丈夫。

对这封信我很恼火。关于伊丽莎白和罗伯特·达德利之间有许多传闻。他们是好朋友——他经常和她唱歌、跳舞、聊天。人们说他有时还一整夜待在她的房间里。达德利有妻子，但有一天却突然死了。他们说那是一次意外事故——她从楼梯上摔了下来。不过，也许她很不快乐，由于他丈夫和伊丽莎白的关系。

“她写信给我介绍这样一个男人！”我想，“她想让他娶我，是因为他是她的朋友——或许是她的情人。她想让她的情人成为苏格兰的国王！”

詹姆斯，我找到了一个比达德利好的男人，他就是你的父亲亨利·达恩利。

他19岁，我23岁。他很高大，有一张英俊的脸庞和一双绿色的大眼睛。他说话很动听，歌也唱得好。我很喜欢和他一起跳舞。他经常穿一身昂贵的黑色衣服，而且和我在一起时他常常开怀大笑。他是那样年轻友善，和他在一起我感到很幸福。我非常喜欢他，我想他也爱我。

他还是个很重要的人物。我们是堂姐弟——他的祖父曾是苏格兰国王，他的曾祖父是英格兰的亨利七世。

1565年7月，我嫁给了他，伊丽莎白非常恼怒，许多苏格兰贵族也是。我的同父异母兄弟，马里伯爵，试图阻止这场婚姻。我不得不和他作战，他逃到了南方，去了英格兰。但是我很快乐。你的父亲和我每天欢声笑语。他现在是苏格兰亨利亲王了。

过了一两个星期，笑声不复存在。一个国王有许多工作要做，詹姆斯，你是知道的。他不得不阅读成百上千封书信；和民众交谈；考虑许多重要的事务。我每天做这些事情，不过现在，我想我有个男人来帮我了。

“亨利，我的勋爵，”我说，“你想和我一起阅读这些书信吗？你可以陪在我身边，每天和我一起工作。”

你父亲看起来不太高兴。“我对那样的工作不感兴趣，”他说，“我不懂那些。”

“当然不懂啦，”我说，“你还年轻，我亲爱的。不过我可以教你，”

他和我一起坐了一两天，我试着去教他。但没错，他确实对这项工作不感兴趣，也不打算去领会。

“你做吧，玛丽，”他说，“我要和朋友们出去，我们要去骑马、喝酒、游泳。”

因此我又承担起所有的工作。晚上，他也经常和镇上的朋友一起出去。他们喝很多酒，又笑又唱，还经常打架。但没有人说什么，因为他是亲王，我的丈夫。人们能说什么呢？他们很不高兴，但他们怕他。他们中有些人去了英格兰，到马里伯爵那里去了。

那段时间我经常感到疲惫不堪，因为我怀孕了。你，我的儿子詹姆斯，在我的体内生存着。可我仍在做一个女王应做的一切工作，而我也需要朋友。朋友中有一位是个年轻的意大利人，叫达维·里奇奥。

里奇奥是个小男人，他不高，不好看，也不强壮，但他是个非常聪明、有趣的男人。他替我写了许多信，给我帮助。他歌也唱得好，在晚上，有时我们一起唱歌。我很喜欢他，起初，你的父亲也喜欢他。

不过没多久，马里的朋友们开始谈论我和里奇奥。“达维·里奇奥整夜待在女王的房间里。”他们对你的父亲说，“她和他唱歌、跳舞，笑声不断，我的亲王——这是不对的！他不是苏格兰人，也不是她的丈夫，可他总是和她在一起。”

也许他们还说了些别的事情——我不太清楚。很多苏格兰贵族都听到了。不过我告诉你，詹姆斯，在上帝的面前，我没做任何错事。达维·里奇奥是个好人，他工作努力，还帮助我——我当然喜欢他。你的父亲不工作——他每天晚上和他的朋友到镇上去喝酒。

此后的一天晚上，你的父亲回家来了。

4The death of David Riccio

The death of David Riccio

It was a Saturday evening in March 1566. I was in Edinburgh with some friends. David Riccio was there, with six or seven other people. We were in a small room, but there was a good dinner on the table, and we were happy. It was dark outside, but inside it was warm and friendly.

Suddenly, a door opened behind me. In the door was Henry Darnley, my husband. I stood up and smiled.

'Good evening, my lord,' I said. 'Please come in. Would you like something to eat?'

'No, thank you,' he said. 'I'm not hungry. But I want to sit next to you, wife. Please tell that man to move.'

A man got out of the chair next to me and Darnley sat beside me. Then he put his arms round me. I did not like it. His face was hot, and his eyes looked unhappy. But I smiled and said, 'I'm happy to see you, my lord.'

'Are you, Mary?' He laughed. 'Are you really?'

'Yes, of course, my lord. But—'

Then the second door opened and his friend, Lord Ruthven, stood there. He had a knife in his hand. His face was red, and he looked very angry.

At first no one moved. Then Ruthven said, 'Your Majesty, send David Riccio out of this room, now! I want him!'

I looked at Riccio. He was afraid. 'Why?' I said. 'Why do you want him?'

'He is a bad, wicked man!' Ruthven said. 'Send him out !'

'No!' I said. 'You want to kill him. David Riccio is my friend! He stays here, with me!'

'He goes out, woman!' Lord Ruthven said. 'King Henry, hold your wife, please!'

I stood up, but Darnley held my arms and I could not move. David Riccio ran behind me and held my dress. My friends in the room stood up too, and moved towards Ruthven angrily. But he had a knife in his hand.

'Get back!' he said angrily. 'Don't touch me!'

Then five men with knives ran into the little room, and there was a fight. One man held a knife in my face, and another man hit David Riccio, behind me. Then they pulled him out of the room.

'Help me!' he screamed. 'Help me, my Queen—please! They're going to kill me! Don't—aaaaaargh!'

I couldn't help him, because Darniey had me in his arms. But I could hear David Riccio's screams. I think he fell down the stairs, and he screamed for two or three minutes. Then it was quiet.

'What are you doing?' I asked Darnley angrily. 'Riccio is a good man—why are you doing this?'

Darnley laughed. 'You are my wife, Mary—not David Riccio's!' he said. 'So why are you with him every evening? You never talk to me!'

'I don't talk to you because you are never here!' I said. 'You are always drinking with your friends! You aren't a king, you're a stupid boy!'

He laughed again. It was not a nice laugh. 'Well,' he said. 'Perhaps I am a boy, but that is better than David Riccio, now. Do you want to go and see him?'

I did see him, five minutes after that. He was very dead, and there was blood all over the floor. Poor David Riccio. He sings to God now, not me.

I looked at Henry Darnley, my husband. He had a stupid smile on his face. But I think he was afraid of me. I looked at him a long time, and the smile went away.

'Remember this night, husband,' I said to him. 'Remember it well. Think about it when you look into my eyes, and before you go to sleep. David Riccio was my friend, and you killed him in front of me. I'm never going to forget that, Henry Darnley. Never!'

4 　达维·里奇奥之死

1566年3月的一个星期六晚上，我和一些朋友待在爱丁堡。达维·里奇奥也在那里，另外还有六七个人。我们在一间小屋子里，而桌上摆着丰盛的菜肴，我们都很高兴。虽然外面夜幕笼罩，但屋子里充满了温暖和友好的气氛。

突然，我身后的门被打开了，门口站着我的丈夫亨利·达恩利。我站起来朝他笑。

“晚上好，勋爵，”我说道，“请进来吧，你想吃点什么吗？”

“不，谢谢，”他说，“我不饿。但我想坐在你身边，我的妻子。请叫那个人走开。”

一人从我身旁的座位上站起来，达恩利坐到了我身边。然后他伸出手环抱着我。我不喜欢这样。他的脸很热，他的眼神看起来很不高兴。但我还是笑着对他说：“很高兴见到你，勋爵。”

“是吗，玛丽？”他笑道，“是真的吗？”

“是的，当然是的，勋爵。不过——”

接着，第二扇门打开了，他的朋友——鲁斯温勋爵站在那儿。他手里拿着一把刀，他的脸红红的，满脸怒容。

起初，谁也没有动。然后鲁斯温说道：“陛下，叫达维·里奇奥从这房间里出去，马上！我要带他走！”

我看着里奇奥，他显得很害怕。“为什么？”我问，“你为什么要抓他？”

“他是个不讲道德的坏人！”鲁斯温说，“把他赶出去！”

“不！”我说，“你想杀了他。达维·里奇奥是我的朋友！他就待在这里，和我在一起！”

“他得出来，女人！”鲁斯温勋爵说，“亨利亲王，抓住你的妻子，快点！”

我站了起来，可是达恩利抓住我的胳膊，我不能动弹。达维·里奇奥跑到我身后抓住我的衣服。我房间里的朋友们也站了起来，愤怒地向鲁斯温逼近，但是鲁斯温手里拿着刀。

“回去！”他怒吼，“不要碰我！”

接着，五个拿刀的男人冲进了这间小屋。一场冲突开始了。一个男人把刀架在我面前，另一个人去攻击躲在我身后的达维·基奇奥。然后他们把他拖出了房间。

“救命！”他尖叫道，“救救我，我的女王——请救救我！他们要杀我！不要——啊！”

我帮不了他，因为达恩利紧紧抓着我。可是我能听到达维·里奇奥的尖叫声。我想他是从楼梯上摔了下去，尖叫持续了二三分钟后，一切归于平静。

“你在干什么？”我愤怒地责问达恩利，“里奇奥是个好人——你为什么要这样做？”

达恩利笑了起来“你是我的妻子，玛丽——不是达维·里奇奥的！”他说，“所以你为什么要每晚和他待在一起？你从没对我说过！”

“我没有对你说是因为你从来不在这里！”我说，“你总是和你的朋友们不停地喝酒！你不是个亲王，你是个愚蠢的小男孩！”

他又一次笑了，那是个不怀好意的笑。“好吧，”他说，“也许我只是个男孩，但此刻也比达维·里奇奥强。你想去看看他吗？”

五分钟后，我看到了他。他已经死了，地上到处是血。可怜的达维·里奇奥，他现在给上帝唱歌了，而不再为我。

我看着亨利·达恩利——我的丈夫。他脸上带着愚蠢的微笑。但我认为他还是怕我的。我盯着他看了很久，他脸上的笑容渐渐消失了。

“记住今天晚上，丈夫，”我对他说，“好好记住。在你看着我的眼睛的时候，在你上床睡觉之前，好好想一想这件事。达维·里奇奥是我的朋友，而你却当着我的面杀死了他。对此我永远都不会忘记，亨利·达恩利，永远不！”

5My son is born

My son is born

Next morning, Darnley came to see me. He was afraid. 'What's the matter, husband?' I said. 'Why are you crying?'

'Oh Mary, Mary!' he said. 'I'm sorry! I was wrong! I helped those men to kill Riccio, and now the Earl of Moray is back here with them! He hates me! I am afraid they're going to kill me, and you too. Think of our child, Mary, here inside you!'

He took me in his arms again. I was very angry. I am sorry, James, that this man was your father. He was a stupid boy, not a man. He was tall and strong and beautiful but he could never think like a man or a king.

I said, 'You know these men, Henry. What do they want?'

'They—they want our child, Mary. They don't want us. They're going to put you in prison. They don't want you to be Queen—they want your child to be King or Queen. I—I don't know what they want to do with me.'

'Perhaps they want you to be King, too, without me,' I said quietly. 'Then you can do what they say, like a little boy.'

'Perhaps, Mary. They said that, yesterday. But now that Moray's here—I don't know. I'm afraid. Please help me!' He began to cry again. 'What can we do?'

'We can run away,' I said. 'We can leave Edinburgh quickly and quietly, before Ruthven and his men stop us. Be quiet for a minute. I want to think.'

I walked up and down for two or three minutes, then I said: 'Henry, go back to these men. Tell them—'

'No! Mary, please! I can't! I'm afraid of them!'

'Listen to me, Henry! And try to be a man. Go and tell them I'm ill, because of the child. Say I'm not angry with them. Tell them anything—lie to them. Then, tonight, bring some men and horses here, behind the castle...'

He went, and did it. All day I waited in my rooms. and listened. Then, at one o'clock in the morning, Darnley and I went quietly down the stairs behind the castle. Some of my friends were there, with horses for us. Quickly, we rode away into the night.

That was a very bad night. It was dark and cold. I was ill, and Darnley was afraid. 'Come on!' he said. 'Ride faster, woman! You're too slow!'

But I was pregnant, and it was cold and dark. We rode for five hours in the rain. 'I can't, Henry!' I said. 'I'm ill. Think of the baby! I don't want it to die!'

'Why not?' he said. 'We can always make another one!'

I'm sorry, but it is true. Your father said things like that, James. Then he rode away in front of me, into the dark. I rode slowly behind, with my good woman, Bess Curle.

In the morning we arrived at Dunbar Castle. Darnley slept, and I wrote letters to my friends. Next day Lord Bothwell came to help me. I liked him—he was a good, strong man. Soon I had an army of 8,000 men. Bothwell and I rode back to Edinburgh with the army. Lord Ruthven died, and some of his friends ran away. But the Earl of Moray stayed.

All that summer I ruled the country, and waited for the baby. My husband stayed outside my rooms. I did not want to see him. No one did. Perhaps he drank with his friends. I don't know.

And then, on 19th June, in a small room in Edinburgh Castle, my baby was born. It took a long time, but at last you were in my arms, James, my son.

I asked your father to come in. 'My Lord Henry,' I said. 'This is our baby! Look at him, my Lord. Take him in your arms. He is your son—isn't he beautiful?'

But you father did not love me, James. Very often, after you were born, he slept with other women. I know that because he talked to everyone about it. I think he wanted people to know. And I am sorry, but I do not think he loved you, James. When I took you to church and gave you your name, he did not come. He wasn't interested.

But because of him, David Riccio was dead. I could never forget that. Never.

5 　我儿子的出生

第二天早晨，达恩利来见我。他显得很害怕。

“怎么了，丈夫？”我问道，“你干吗哭？”

“噢，玛丽，玛丽！”他说，“对不起，我错了！我帮助那些人杀死了里奇奥，现在马里伯爵回来了，和他们在一起！他恨我！我怕他们会杀了我，还有你。玛丽，为你肚子里的我们的孩子想一想吧！”

他又一次抱着我。我很生气。很抱歉，詹姆斯，这人就是你的父亲。他是个愚蠢的男孩，不是个男子汉。他高大健壮又漂亮，可是他从来没像个男子汉或一个亲王似的考虑问题。

我说：“你了解这些人，亨利。他们想要什么？”

“他们——他们想要我们的孩子，玛丽。他们不要我们。他们要把你关进监狱，他们不想让你做女王，他们想让你的孩子做国王或女王。我——我不知道他们要怎样处置我。”

“或许他们也想让你做国王，而不要我。”我很平静地说，“然后你就按他们说的去做，像个乖男孩。”

“也许吧，玛丽。他们昨天是这样说的。不过既然马里回来了——我就说不准了。我很害怕，请帮帮我吧！”他又开始哭了起来，“我们该怎么办？”

“我们可以逃走，”我说，“我们可以在鲁斯温和他的手下阻拦我们之前迅速而不声不响地离开爱丁堡。安静一会儿，让我想一想。”

我来来回回徘徊了二三分钟，然后说道：“亨利，回到那些人那里去。告诉他们——”

“不！玛丽，请别这样！我办不到！我怕他们！”

“听我说，亨利！试着做一个男子汉。去告诉他们，我病了，是因为怀孕的缘故。说我不生他们的气。再跟他们说些什么——骗骗他们。然后，今天晚上，带上这里的一些人和马，从城堡后面……”

他去了，也这样做了。一整天我等在自己的房间里听动静。然后在清晨1点钟，达恩利和我悄悄地从城堡后的楼梯下来。我的一些朋友们已牵了马等在那里。很快地，我们骑马消失在夜幕里。

那是个很糟糕的夜晚。外面又黑又冷。我生病了，达恩利很害怕。“快点！”他说，“骑得再快点，女人，你太慢了！”

可我是个孕妇，外面又冷又黑。我们在雨中骑了五个小时。“我不能再骑了，亨利！”我说，“我病了。为孩子想一想！我不想让它死掉！”

“为什么不呢？”他说，“我们总有机会再要一个！”

我很抱歉，但那是真的。你父亲是那样说的，詹姆斯。随后，他远远地骑在了我前面，消失在夜色里。我和我的好伙伴贝斯·柯尔在后面慢慢地骑着。

早晨我们到了唐巴尔城堡。达恩利睡着了，我给我的朋友写信。第二天，博思韦尔勋爵来帮我了。我喜欢他——他是个善良、健壮的男人。不久，我就拥有了一支八千士兵组成的军队。博思韦尔和我率领着军队驱马回到爱丁堡。结果鲁斯温勋爵死了，他的一些朋友逃走了。可马里伯爵留了下来。

整个夏季我治理着这个国家，并等待着孩子的降生。我的丈夫不在我房间。我不想见到他。没有人想见到他。或许他和他的朋友在一起喝酒。我不知道。

不久以后，6月19日，在爱丁堡的一间小房间里，我的孩子出生了。詹姆斯，我的儿子，生你费了好长时间，但最终，你还是躺在我怀抱里了。

我把你父亲叫进来。“亨利，我的勋爵。”我说，“这是我们的孩子！看着他吧，勋爵。抱抱他，他是你的儿子——难道他不漂亮吗？”

可是你的父亲不爱我，詹姆斯。在你出生之后，他经常和别的女人睡觉。我知道这个是因为他对谁都这么说。我想他是想让人们都知道。我很抱歉，可我认为他并不爱你，詹姆斯。当我带你去教堂给你取名字时，他没来，他没有兴趣。

可就是因为他，达维·里奇奥死了。我永远不会忘记这一点，永远不！

6Kirk O'Field

Kirk O'Field

I had a new man to help me now. The Earl of Bothwell—a strong, clever man. He was older than me; he was not a boy like Darnley. He worked hard and he could think. He was a good fighter and he was not afraid of other men. Perhaps you are like him, James, my son?

In January your father, Darnley, was ill in Glasgow. I went to see him, and took him back to Edinburgh. He was unhappy, and afraid of people. He saw enemies behind every door. Poor stupid boy! He said he loved me again. I was angry, but I felt sorry for him, too. He was very ill.

'It's not far now, Henry,' I said. 'You can sleep in the castle.'

'No, not there, please, Mary!' he said. 'I don't want to go into the castle. I'm afraid of it!'

'But where do you want to go?' I asked.

'Find me a little house outside the town, and stay with me there,' he said. 'We can be happy there.'

So I found him a small house called Kirk o'Field, outside Edinburgh. He stayed there, in a room upstairs, and sometimes I slept in a room downstairs. Darnley was often afraid, and I visited him every day. Slowly, he got better.

On Sunday, 9th February, there was a big wedding in Edinburgh. After the wedding, Bothwell and I walked out to Kirk o'Field to see Darnley and talk to him. Everyone sang, and laughed, and was very happy.

At ten o'clock I was tired. 'Good night, my lords,' I said. 'I'm going downstairs to bed.'

Lord Bothwell put his hand on my arm. 'Your Majesty,' he said. 'You can't sleep here now. Don't you remember? People are dancing and singing in town tonight—everyone wants you to go.'

'Oh, yes. I forgot,' I said. 'Of course, people want to see me there. So, good night, Henry. Sleep well.'

Darnley was very unhappy. 'Please, Mary my love, don't go!' he said. 'Don't leave me here!'

But I did not love him now. I remembered the night when Riccio died. So I smiled and said, 'Good night, Henry. Be a man now. Don't be afraid of the dark.'

Then I went downstairs with Lord Bothwell. Outside the house, we met one of Bothwell's men. He looked afraid, and there was something black on his face and hands.

'Jesus, man, how dirty you are!' I said. 'Don't come near me with those hands.'

'No, my lady, of course not,' he said. He looked at Bothwell for a minute, and then ran away quickly. I laughed, got on my horse, and forgot about it.

I tell you before God, James, I did not kill your father. It was not me. I knew nothing about it—nothing!

I sang and danced in town, and then went to bed in Edinburgh Castle. Then, at two o'clock in the morning, there was a sudden noise—a very big BANG ! Everybody heard it all through the town.

'My God!' I said. 'What's that?'

Everyone ran out of their rooms. Lord Bothwell was downstairs. 'Don't be afraid, ladies,' he said. 'My men are outside—they're going to see what it is.'

After an hour he came to see me. 'Please sit down, my lady,' he said. 'I have some unhappy news.'

'Yes, my lord. What is it?'

'It's your husband, Lord Darnley. He is dead.'

'But—how? How did he die? Who killed him?'

'I don't know, my lady. That bang—that was his house, Kirk o'Field. It's not there any more.'

'What? And Darnley was inside?'

'Well, no, my lady,' Bothwell said slowly. 'My men found him in the garden, not in the house. He is wearing only nightclothes, and there is no blood on him. But he is dead. I am sorry.'

'Take me out there! I want to see him—now!'

'Yes, my lady.'

I went out to Kirk o'Field in the early morning. There was no house now—no walls, no doors, no windows—nothing. And there in the garden, a long way from the house, was that poor dead boy, my husband.

I did not love him but I cried then. He was your father, James, and I did not kill him. I don't know who killed him, but he had many enemies in Scotland.

I was very afraid. I, too, had enemies, and I often slept there. Perhaps someone wanted to kill me, too.

6 　柯克·欧菲尔德

现在，又有一个人来帮我了。博思韦尔勋爵——一个健壮聪明的男人。他比我大；他不像达恩利那样像个小男孩。他工作努力且会思考。他是个勇士，他不怕别人。或许你像他，詹姆斯，我的儿子？

一月份，你的父亲，达恩利在格拉斯哥生病了。我去看他，并把他带回爱丁堡。他很不愉快且害怕周围的人。每一扇门后面他都能看见仇敌。可怜、愚蠢的男孩！他说他又爱我了。我很生气，但我也觉得对不住他。他病得很重。

“现在不远了，亨利，”我说，“你可以睡在城堡里。”

“不，我不睡那儿，求求你，玛丽！”他说，“我不想走进城堡。我怕！”

“但是你要去哪儿呢？”我问道。

“给我在镇外找一间小房子，我们一起待在那儿，”他说，“我们在那里可以很幸福，”

于是，我在爱丁堡外给他找了一间叫柯克·欧菲尔德的小屋。他住在那边楼上的一个房间里，而我有时候睡在楼下的房间里。达恩利经常感到恐惧。我每天都去看望他。渐渐地，他好转起来了。

2月9日，星期日，在爱丁堡有一个大型的婚礼。婚礼结束后，我和博思韦尔一起出来去柯克·欧菲尔德看望达恩利，陪他聊天。大家欢歌笑语，非常快乐。

10点钟了，我感到很累。“晚安，我的勋爵们，”我说道，“我要下楼去睡了。”

博思韦尔勋爵抓住我的胳膊。“陛下，”他说，“现在您不能睡在这儿。您难道忘了？今晚人们在镇上载歌载舞——每个人都希望您去。”

“噢，对，我忘了，”我说，“当然，人们想在那儿见到我。好吧，晚安，亨利，睡个好觉。”

达恩利很不高兴。“玛丽，我亲爱的，请不要走！”他说，“不要留下我一人在这里！”

可是我现在不爱他了。我想起里奇奥被杀的那一晚。于是我笑着说：“晚安，亨利。现在要像个男子汉。不要害怕黑暗。”

于是我和博思韦尔勋爵下了楼。在房子外面，我们碰到了一个博思韦尔的手下。他看起来很惊慌，脸上和手上沾了些黑乎乎的东西。

“天哪，你这个人多脏啊！”我说，“手这么脏，不要走近我。”

“是，夫人，当然不，”他说，他朝博思韦尔看了一眼，很快就跑开了。我笑了，骑上马背，就把这事给忘了。

在上帝面前，詹姆斯，我告诉你，我没有杀死你的父亲。不是我杀的。我对此一无所知——一点儿也不知道！

我在镇上又唱又跳，然后就睡在了爱丁堡城里。早晨两点钟，突然传来了轰的一声巨响！整个镇上的人都听见了。

“我的上帝啊！”我说，“那是什么声音？”

大家都从自己的房间里跑出来。博思韦尔勋爵下了楼。“不要害怕，夫人们，”他说道，“我的人已经出去了——他们去看看到底是怎么回事。”

一个小时后他来见我，“请坐下，夫人，”他说道，“我有一些不愉快的消息要告诉您。”

“好的，勋爵，是什么事？”

“是您的丈夫，达恩利亲王。他死了。”

“可是——怎么会？他怎么死的？谁杀了他？”

“我不知道，夫人。那声巨响——就来自他的房子，柯克·欧菲尔德。它已不存在了。”

“什么？可达恩利在里面吗？”

“噢，他不在，夫人，”博思韦尔慢慢地说道，“我的人在花园里而不是在房子里发现了他。他只穿着睡衣，身上没有血迹。可他已经死了。我很难过。”

“把我带到那儿去！我想见他——现在！”

“好吧，夫人。”

清晨，我去了柯克·欧菲尔德。现在那里已经没有房子了——没有墙，没有门，没有窗户——什么也没有。而在花园里，离房子很远的地方，躺着那可怜的男孩的尸体——那就是我的丈夫。

虽然我不爱他，但那时候我哭了。他是你的父亲，詹姆斯，我没有杀他。我不知道是谁杀死了他，但他在苏格兰有很多仇敌。

我感到很害怕。我也有仇敌，而我经常睡在那里。或许有人也想杀我。

7Bothwell

Bothwell

Soon everyone in Europe heard the news. The Queen of France and the Queen of England wrote angry letters to me. Who killed the King? they asked. I was very unhappy at this time, James. We looked for the killers, but we could not find them. Please believe me, James. The Scots lords are difficult men. Some were friends, some were enemies, but they changed all the time.

Many people in Scotland said: 'Bothwell killed Lord Darnley.' I heard them, outside the castle, and in the town. But I never believed it. People in Edinburgh sold horrible stories and pictures of Bothwell the same day that Darnley died. It was too soon. Perhaps Darnley's killers wrote these stories about Bothwell, before they killed Darnley.

I don't think Lord Bothwell killed your father, James. He was a good friend to me in difficult times. He was a good strong, clever man, and he worked hard. I liked that. A lot of women liked him, I think.

Three times that spring, he asked me to marry him. He had a wife, and I could not marry again, so soon. I asked him to wait.

Then, on 24th April, I rode out of Edinburgh to the north. I had five or six friends with me. Six miles outside the town, Lord Bothwell met us, with an army.

'Why are you here, my lord?' I said.

He smiled. 'Because I want to meet you, Mary,' he said. 'I want you to come with me to my castle.' He rode next to me, and his men rode between me and my friends.

I was afraid, and a little excited, too. 'But, my lord, you can't do this!' I said. 'I don't want to come with you now.'

'But I want you, Mary,' he said. 'Your friends can't stop me. I love you, and I want to marry you. What's wrong with that?'

I said nothing. What could I say? I liked him, and he had an army. I had only six friends. So I rode with him to his castle in Dunbar, and stayed there two weeks. And then... He was a strong man, and I was only a woman. And I did like him, James. I liked him very much.

After two weeks in Dunbar, Bothwell and I rode back to Edinburgh. His wife did not want him, and was happy to divorce him. So, on 15th May 1567, I married him.

He was a good man, James. A much better man than your father. I needed a strong man to help me rule the country.

But I was wrong. I understand that now. All the Scots lords were afraid of Bothwell, and many of them were his enemies. They had an army, and on 15th of June, Bothwell and I rode out to fight them.

We met them at Carberry Hill. It was a hot day, and the two big armies stood, and looked, and waited. Their army had a big flag with a picture of your poor dead father, Darnley, on it. Under the picture, there were the words 'Find my killers, oh God.'

'Come on, my lord,' I said to Bothwell. 'Our army is better than theirs—let's fight them!'

Bothwell rode up and down, and talked to his men. But they didn't want to fight. They talked, and looked at the flag, and waited. Then some of them walked home.

At five o'clock that evening Lord Kirkcaldy rode from his army to talk to us. He said to me, 'My lady, leave your husband, and come with us. We don't want men to die.'

And so, because our men didn't want to fight, I went with him. It was a very bad day for me. They took me back to Edinburgh, and people in the streets screamed at me: 'Kill the woman! She sleeps with her husband's killer! We want James to be King! Kill her now!'

I was unhappy, and afraid, and I was pregnant again. They took me to Lochleven Castle, and put me in a room like a prison. There, I did not eat for two weeks, and Bothwell's children—there were two babies—were born dead. I nearly died too—I was so angry and tired and ill. Then, one day after the babies died, Lord Lindsay gave me a letter. It said:

I, Mary, Queen of Scots, give the kingdom of Scotland to my son, James. From today, James is the new King of Scots. But because he is a child, the Earl of Moray, my half-brother, can rule the country for him.

Because I was afraid, and tired, and ill, I wrote my name on the letter: Mary . But it is not important, James, it doesn't change anything. I am Queen of Scots, not you. That letter changes nothing.

Bothwell went over the sea, and died in a prison in Denmark. I was a prisoner in Lochleven for a year. A lot of people in Europe were angry about that. Queen Elizabeth wrote to the Earl of Moray. 'You cannot keep a Queen in prison,' she said. 'It is very wrong!' I was pleased about that. But Moray didn't listen.

Lord Douglas lived in the castle, and his young son, William, liked me. One day, there was a wedding in the castle. People sang and danced and drank. William Douglas gave me some old women's clothes. I put the clothes on, and walked quietly out of the castle with him. He shut the castle door behind us, to keep his father's friends in. Then we got on some horses, and rode away through the night.

All my friends came back to me. Soon I had a big army. 'Mary is our Queen again!' people said. 'Give her back her son!' You were in Earl Moray's castle, James, so I came to fight him. I rode with my army to Langside, near Glasgow. And there...

There, James...

There, my son, I lost the fight. I am so sorry. I had many good, strong men in my army, but Earl Moray's men were stronger. Many of my men died, and some ran away. After the fight, I ran away too.

I did not want to go to prison again. So I rode south, to England. 'Queen Elizabeth wants to help me,' I thought. 'She understands. She wrote to Moray and she is a Queen, like me. I can come back to Scotland with her army, kill Moray, and find my baby son James. I am in England but I am free. I can try again.'

I was wrong about that, too. Very wrong.

7 　博思韦尔

不久，每个欧洲人都听说了这件事。法国女王和英格兰女王给我写来了愤怒的信。谁杀死了亲王？她们质问道。在那段时间里我很不愉快，詹姆斯。我们寻找凶手，但是我们没能找到。请相信我，詹姆斯。苏格兰的贵族们很难对付。有些是朋友，有些是敌人，可他们一直不停地变。

苏格兰的很多人都说：“博思韦尔杀死了达恩利亲王。”在城堡外，在镇上，我都能听到这种传言。但是我从来不相信它。爱丁堡的人出售有关博思韦尔的可怕的故事和图片，叫作《达恩利死的同一天》。这简直太神速了。或许杀死达恩利的凶手们在他们杀死达恩利之前就写了这些有关博思韦尔的故事。

我认为博思韦尔勋爵没有杀害你父亲，詹姆斯。在我艰难时，他是我很好的朋友。他是个善良、健壮、聪明的男人，而且他工作努力。我很喜欢这点。我想许多女人都喜欢他。

那年春天，他向我求了三次婚。他有妻子，我不能这么快又一次嫁人。我让他等一等。

随后，4月24日，我骑马离开爱丁堡去北方。有五六个朋友随行。在出城镇6英里的地方，博思韦尔勋爵带着一支队伍在那里迎候我。

“你怎么在这儿，勋爵？”我问道。

他笑了。“因为我想见到你，玛丽，”他说，“我想让你跟我到我的城堡去。”他骑马跟在我旁边，他的人骑马跟在我和我的朋友之间。

我很害怕，又有点儿激动。“可是，勋爵，你不能这样做！”我说，“我不想现在就跟你走。”

“但是我需要你，玛丽。”他说，“你的朋友们阻止不了我。我爱你。我要娶你。那又有什么错？”

我无话可说。我能说什么呢？我喜欢他，并且他有一支队伍，而我只有六个朋友。于是，我骑马随他来到他在唐巴尔的城堡，并在那儿待了两个星期。之后……他是个强有力的男人，而我只是个女人。而且我确实很喜欢他，詹姆斯。我非常喜欢他。

在唐巴尔待了两个星期后，我和博思韦尔驱马回到爱丁堡。他的妻子不想要他了，并且很乐意地和他离了婚。因此，在1567年5月15日，我嫁给了他。

他是个好人，詹姆斯。一个比你父亲好得多的男人。我需要一个强壮的男人来帮我统治这个国家。

但是我错了。现在我明白了。所有苏格兰贵族都很害怕博思韦尔，他们中有许多人是他的敌人。他们拥有一支军队。于是在6月15日，我和博思韦尔策马去迎战他们。

我们在卡贝琳山头相遇。那是个炎热的一天，两支大军伫立着互相观望等待。他们的军队有一面很大的旗帜，上面是你可怜的死去的父亲达恩利的画像，画像下面有一行字：“找出杀死我的凶手，噢！上帝！”

“冲吧，勋爵，”我对博思韦尔说道，“我们的军队比他们的强，跟他们战斗吧！”

博思韦尔骑着马跑来跑去，并和他的人说着什么。可他们不想打仗。他们一边望着那面军旗，一边谈论着、等待着。然后，有一些人回去了。

晚上5点钟，柯克考德勋爵骑马从他的军队里过来和我们谈话。他对我说：“夫人，离开你的丈夫，跟我们一起走。我们不想有人死亡。”

正因为我们的人不想打仗，我跟他走了。这一天对我来说实在太糟了。他们把我带回了爱丁堡，街上的人们冲着我尖叫：“杀了这个女人！她和杀她丈夫的凶手一起睡觉！我们要让詹姆斯做国王！现在就杀了她！”

我既伤心又害怕，那时候我又怀孕了。他们把我带到拉克利文城堡，并把我关进一间像监狱一样的房间里。在那里，我两个星期没有吃饭，并且怀着博思韦尔的孩子——两个婴儿——一出生就死了。我几乎也要死掉——我感到非常愤怒、非常疲惫，而且病得很重。在两个婴儿死后的一天，林德辛勋爵给了我一封信，信上写道：

我，玛丽，苏格兰女王，把苏格兰王国交给我的儿子，詹姆斯。从今天起，詹姆斯就是苏格兰的新国王了。但因为他还是个小孩，可以由马里伯爵，我的同父异母兄弟为他治理这个国家。

由于我害怕、疲惫，又在生病，于是我便在信上签了名：玛丽。但这并不重要，詹姆斯，这并不能改变什么。我仍是苏格兰的女王，而你不是。那封信改变不了什么。

博思韦尔飘洋过海，并死在了丹麦的监狱中。我在拉克利文做了一年的囚徒。许多欧洲人民对此感到愤怒。伊丽莎白女王写信给马里伯爵。“你不能囚禁一个女王，”她说，“这是极其错误的！”我很高兴她这样说。但马里根本不听。

道格拉斯勋爵住在这城堡里，他年轻的儿子威廉很喜欢我。一天，在城堡里举行了一场婚礼。人们唱歌跳舞，举杯畅饮。威廉·道格拉斯给了我一些老妇人的衣服。我穿上这些衣服，并随他偷偷地离开了城堡。他关上了身后城堡的门，把他父亲的朋友们留在里面。于是我们骑上马，连夜离开了。

我所有的朋友都回到了我身边。不久，我就有了一支庞大的军队。“玛丽又是我们的女王了！”人们说道，“把她的儿子还给她！”你在马里伯爵的城堡里，詹姆斯，因此我去和他作战。我骑马率领我的军队来到格拉斯哥附近的朗塞得，并且在那里……

在那里，詹姆斯……

在那里，我的儿子，我战败了。我是那么伤心。在我的军队里，有许多精良的战士，可马里伯爵的士兵比我们的还要强壮。我的很多人都战死了，有些跑了。战争结束后，我也落荒而逃。

我再也不想进监狱了。因此我往南骑，去英格兰。“伊丽莎白女王会帮助我。”我想，“她能理解的。她给马里写过信，并且她像我一样是个女王。我可以带着她的军队回到苏格兰，杀了马里，找回我的孩子詹姆斯。我虽在英格兰，但我是自由人，我可以东山再起。”

关于这点我又错了，而且大错特错。

8England

England

Elizabeth didn't give me her army. She put me in prison. You know this, James—it is the story of your life, not mine. I was twenty-five years old when I came to England, and I am forty-five now. Twenty years in English prisons.

Moray told lies about me. Mary and Bothwell killed Darnley, he said. Mary slept with Riccio and Bothwell and killed her husband. But it's not true! They're all lies, James— wicked lies! They only said these things because I am a woman, and a Catholic, and they don't want a Catholic queen in Scotland, they want a Protestant king.

A king like you, James. Why, James my son, don't you help me? Why are you friendly with Elizabeth, my enemy? You don't want me back in Scotland, do you? You believe these lies, don't you? You talk to Moray and his friends, every day. But they lied about me, James. Moray and his friends killed Riccio. They killed your father, too. They stole my husband Bothwell, stole my son...

Stole my son's love...

I am sorry, James. Forgive me. Sometimes I get very angry. It is difficult not to be angry, when you are in prison for twenty years.

Elizabeth didn't know what to do. Sometimes she believed Moray, sometimes she didn't. She was afraid to kill me, because I was a Queen. She was afraid to let me go free, because I have friends in England. The English Catholics want me to be Queen of England, not her. And she is a woman with no husband and no son, so she hates me, too.

Sometimes the English Catholics write to me and ask me for help, and sometimes I write to them. Sometimes Elizabeth's men find these letters. The English Protestants want to kill me because of these letters. 'You are a wicked woman!' They say. 'You killed your husband, Darnley, and now you want to kill our Queen Elizabeth. You're going to die!'

'I did not kill my husband,' I said. 'And when I came to England, I did not want to kill your Queen. I asked her for help—I wanted to go back to Scotland! But, my lords, she put me in prison for twenty years! Twenty years, my lords! I want to be free—don't you understand that? When men write to me and try to help me, then yes, sometimes I write back! Why not? Is that wicked, do you think?'

They didn't listen. Of course not. They want to kill me. And so they wrote to Queen Elizabeth. And now I sit here, in Fotheringhay Castle, and wait for her to answer. I do not want to die, James my son, but I do not want to live all my life in an English prison. I am old, and tired of life. Think well of me, James, my son, and...

8 　英格兰

伊丽莎白没有给我她的军队。她把我关进了监狱。你知道这些的，詹姆斯——它是有关你生活的故事，不是我的。我来到英格兰时才25岁，而现在我已经45岁了，在英格兰的监狱里待了20年。

有关我的情况马里撒了谎。他说玛丽和博思韦尔杀死了达恩利，玛丽和里奇奥、博思韦尔同床共眠，还杀死了她的丈夫。但这不是真的！它们全是谎言，詹姆斯——恶意的谎言！他们这么说就是因为我是个女人，是个天主教教徒，而且在苏格兰，他们不想要一个是天主教教徒的女王，他们想要一个是新教教徒的国王。

一个像你这样的国王，詹姆斯。为什么不帮助我呢？詹姆斯，我的儿子，为什么你还和伊丽莎白，我的仇敌友好相处呢？你不想让我回到苏格兰，是吗？你相信这些谎言，不是吗？你每天和马里以及他的朋友们说话。可是他们编造了关于我的谎言，詹姆斯。马里和他的朋友杀死了里奇奥，然后又杀死了你的父亲。他们偷走了我的丈夫博思韦尔，偷走了我的儿子……

偷走了我儿子的爱……

我很抱歉，詹姆斯。原谅我。有时候我很愤怒。当你在监狱待了20年之久，不生气是很难的。

伊丽莎白不知道该怎样做。她有时相信马里，有时候不。她不敢杀我，因为我是个女王。她不敢让我获得自由是因为我在英格兰有朋友。英格兰天主教教徒想让我成为英格兰女王，而不是她。再说她是个没有丈夫没有儿子的女人，因此她也恨我。

有时英格兰的天主教教徒们给我写信并寻求帮助，有时我也写信给他们。有时伊丽莎白的人发现了这些书信。英格兰的新教教徒们想杀我就是因为这些书信。“你是个邪恶的女人！”他们说，“你杀死了自己的丈夫达恩利，而现在你又想杀我们的女王伊丽莎白。你死期将至了。”

“我没有杀害我丈夫，”我说，“而且当我来到英格兰时，我并没有想杀害你们的女王。我来请求她的帮助——我想回到苏格兰！但是，我的勋爵们，她把我关进了监狱整整20年！20年啊！我的勋爵们！我要自由——难道你们不理解吗？人们给我写信试图想帮助我，的确是的，有时我也回信！为什么不呢？你们认为这很伤天害理吗？”

他们不听。当然不听了。他们想杀我。因此他们给伊丽莎白女王写信。现在我坐在这里，在福瑟临黑城堡里，等待她的答复。我不想死，詹姆斯我的儿子，但是我也不想一辈子待在英格兰监狱里。我老了，对生活也厌倦了。多想一想我吧，詹姆斯，我的儿子，并且……

9A death

A death

Queen Mary stopped writing then. Yesterday afternoon, 7th February 1587, we heard a horse outside our window. Mary looked out. There was a man there, on the road from London. He had a letter from the Queen of England.

In the evening, an Englishman, Lord Shrewsbury, came to see Mary, 'I am sorry, my lady,' he said. 'But I have a letter from my Queen. You're going to die, tomorrow.'

Mary did not move. 'When?' she asked quietly.

'At half past eight in the morning,' he said. 'I am very sorry, my lady.' He went away.

We did not sleep much that night. We talked and prayed to God, and she gave me her letter to her son, James. 'Give it to him, Bess, please,' she said. 'And tell him how I died.'

'Yes, my lady,' I said. And so now I am going to tell you. King James. This is how your mother died.

At six o'clock she got up, prayed, and dressed. She put on a red petticoat first, then a black dress, and a white veil over the dress. The veil came from her head to her feet; she could see out through it, but we could not see her face. She looked like a woman on her wedding day.

When the Englishmen came we went downstairs with her. Her little dog walked beside her, under the veil, but the Englishmen didn't see that. Six of us went into a big room with her. A hundred people stood and watched.

A Protestant churchman came to talk to her, 'My lady,' he said. 'Pray with me—'

'No,' she said. 'Thank you, but no. I was born a Catholic and I'm going to die a Catholic. I think God understands that.' She prayed for five minutes, and then stood up. The executioner came towards her. He was a big, strong man with an axe, and something black over his face.

'I am sorry, my lady,' he said. 'I don't hate you, but this is my work. Please forgive me.'

'Of course I forgive you,' Mary said. 'I am old, and tired, and you're going to open my prison doors for me. I am going to see God. Do your work well.'

Then she looked at me and her friends. 'Don't cry for me, ladies,' she said. 'Please, don't cry now.'

She could not walk to the block, so the executioner helped her. He took off her white veil, and then he took off her black dress, and put it on the floor. She stood there, in her red petticoat, with a smile on her face. Then the executioner put something over her eyes. Very slowly, Mary put her head on the block.

'The Lord my God is my one true friend,' she said. 'I give my life, oh God, into your hands.'

Then the executioner lifted his axe, once... twice... oh God! three times... and her head—her poor, poor head, fell on the floor.

It was very quiet in the room after that. It is a little thing, a head—a very little thing. But there was so much blood— blood on her red petticoat, blood on her black dress and her white veil, blood on the executioner's shoes, blood all over the floor. Blood, blood everywhere.

We all looked, and said nothing. The executioner put down his axe and stood quietly. And then Mary's little dog came out from under her bloody dress and veil, and walked slowly, unhappily, through the blood towards her head.

My lord, the story of your poor mother's life finishes here. We, her friends, cry for her, but that is how your mother died. She died like a Queen. A good lady and a famous Queen.

Mary, Queen of Scots.

9 　死亡

然后，玛丽女王停止了写信。昨天下午，即1587年的2月7日，我们听到窗外传来了马蹄声。玛丽向窗外望去，从伦敦方向来的路上出现了一个男人，他捎来了英格兰女王的一封信。

晚上，一个英格兰人，施鲁斯伯里勋爵来看玛丽。“我很抱歉，夫人，”他说，“可是我有一封我的女王写来的信。您明天将被处死。”

玛丽一动也没动。“什么时候？”她平静地问道。

“早上8点半钟。”他说，“我十分抱歉，夫人。”他说完就离开了。

那晚我们没睡多少。我们谈着话并且向上帝祈祷，她把给她儿子詹姆斯的信交给我。“请把信交给他，贝斯，”她说，“并且告诉他我是怎么死的。”

“好的，夫人。”我说道。因此，现在就由我来告诉你，詹姆斯国王，你母亲是怎么死的吧。

早上6点钟，她起床了，祈祷完毕，穿好衣服。她先穿上一件红色的衬裙，然后穿上一件黑色的连衣裙，再在裙子外面套上一件白色的面纱。面纱一直从头罩到脚；透过它，她能看得见外面，但我们却不能看到她的脸。她看起来像个婚礼上的新娘。

那个英格兰人来的时候，我们就跟着她下了楼。她的小狗跟在她身边，跑在面纱下面，但那个英格兰人没有注意到。我们6个人跟着她走进了一个大房间，有100人站在那里观望。

一个新教教士走过来和她说话。“夫人，”他说道，“跟我一起祈祷——”

“不，”她说，“谢谢你，但我不。我生为天主教教徒，死也为天主教教徒。我想上帝会明白的。”她祈祷了5分钟，然后站了起来。那刽子手向她走过来。他又大又壮，手里拿着斧子，一个黑乎乎的东西盖着他的脸。

“我很抱歉，夫人，”他说，“我并不憎恶您，但这是我的工作。请原谅我。”

“我当然会原谅你。”玛丽说，“我老了，也感到累了，你将为我打开监狱的大门。我要去见上帝了。好好干。”

随后她看着我和她的朋友们。“不要为我而哭，夫人们，”她说，“现在请别哭了。”

她不能走到木台那儿，于是那刽子手拉她过去。他摘下她白色的面纱，然后脱下她黑色的连衣裙，放到地板上去。她站在那里，穿着红色的衬裙，脸上带着微笑。接着，那刽子手用东西遮住了她的眼睛。慢慢地，慢慢地，玛丽将头放在了木台上。

“我的主上帝是我一个真正的朋友，”她说，“噢，上帝，我把我的生命放进您手中了。”

然后那刽子手举起了他的斧子。一次……两次……噢，上帝！三次……她的头——她那可怜的，可怜的头颅，掉在了地板上。

在那之后房间里是一片寂静。它是个小东西，一颗头颅——一个非常小的东西，但却有这么多血——鲜血喷到她红色的衬裙上，喷到她黑色的连衣裙和她那白色的面纱上，喷到了刽子手的鞋上，喷得地板上到处都是。血，到处是血。

我们怔怔地看着，一句话也说不出来。刽子手放下了斧子，一言不发地站着。这时，玛丽的小狗从她那溅满血的连衣裙和面纱下面钻了出来，慢慢地、伤心地淌过鲜血，走向她的头颅。

我的国王，有关你可怜的母亲的生平就说到这里了。我们，作为她的朋友，为她哭泣，但这就是你母亲怎么死的。她死得像个女王，一位好夫人，一位驰名的女王。

玛丽，苏格兰女王。

简　介

太阳是一个巨大的燃烧着的火球。没有来自太阳的光和热，我们就不能在地球这颗行星上生存。在这颗行星周围有臭氧层保护着我们免受太阳之火的伤害。但是如果臭氧层破裂，将会怎样呢？现在臭氧层上已经有了小洞，有人说那些小洞会变得越来越大——直到有一天再没有任何东西挡在我们和太阳的火焰之间。

事情发生在2222年。地球人制造了AOL——人工臭氧层。美丽的地球又有了1000年的生命。树又发芽了，下雨了，河里有了水……

但现在是2522年，人工臭氧层已经破裂。幼嫩的树林开始枯萎，河流也逐渐干涸。凯和瑞拉从他们的宇宙飞船里看到了这危险的情景，可他们又能做些什么呢？月亮下面的部族里有他们的朋友，可是路途遥远，而地球首领高格又不肯听从他们的指挥。

1AOL

AOL

Five hundred kilometres over Europe, Ship OM-45 moved north. In a room at the back of the ship, Kiah watched the numbers on the computer in front of him.

'Time for dinner,' Rilla said.

The numbers changed quickly and Kiah's eyes didn't move. Rilla went across the room to his table. She began to watch the numbers, too.

'What's wrong with the satellite?' she asked. She was a beautiful girl, about twenty years old, with long black hair and big eyes.

'Nothing's wrong with the satellite,' Kiah answered quietly. 'It's the AOL.' He began to write the numbers in the book on his table.

Suddenly, the numbers stopped changing. Kiah looked at Rilla. 'Over Europe,' he said. 'It's happening. The AOL is breaking up. There are big holes in the AOL and they're getting bigger.'

'You're right! Shall we see Captain Seru now, before dinner?'

Kiah stood up. He was nearly two metres tall, with dark eyes and hair. 'Yes, come on,' he said.

Quickly, they went to Captain Seru's room. They waited at the door.

'Come in!' Captain Seru called. She was a little woman with a fat face. 'Come in! Would you like a drink?'

'No, thank you,' Kiah answered. 'I'd like you to look at these numbers.' Kiah gave Captain Seru his book.

Captain Seru looked at the numbers. Suddenly, her face changed. 'No, no,' she said. 'I don't want to talk. It's late and I'm tired. Sit down and have a drink.'

Kiah and Rilla sat down. There was a big window in Captain Seru's room. Kiah looked out of the window at the dark sky. He saw the Moon. It was cold and white in the dark sky.

'Captain Seru,' he began. 'It's important. Look at those numbers carefully. The AOL is beginning to—'

'Stop!' Captain Seru stood up and put her hands in her pockets. She went to the window and looked at the sky.

'Three hundred years ago, Earth nearly died,' Rilla said. 'Earth stopped dying because of the AOL. But now, over Europe, the AOL is breaking up. We would like you to talk to Earth Commander.'

Captain Seru did not move. 'Do you remember Adai?' she asked. She didn't wait for an answer. 'I was on his ship, two years ago. One evening, the satellite gave us interesting numbers about the AOL. We went back to Earth and saw Earth Commander.' Captain Seru stopped speaking.

Rilla looked at Kiah. 'And then?' she asked Captain Seru.

'Gog was angry, very angry,' Captain Seru said. 'In the end, he sent Adai to the Moon. Adai's there now, Commander of the Moon colony, under the Moon.'

Kiah waited for a second or two. 'I know about Adai. But we need to talk to Earth Commander again. These numbers are worse.'

Captain Seru's face went red. 'You don't understand. I'm not going to talk to Gog. Last time, he sent me to a weather ship in the Antarctic! This is my first Ship for two years!' And Captain Seru began drinking.

Kiah stood up. 'Thank you, Captain Seru.'

Captain Seru said nothing.

Kiah and Rilla left the room, and walked slowly downstairs. The Ship was dark and quiet. It was eight o'clock and everybody was at dinner.

'What are we going to do next?' Rilla asked.

'I need to talk to Adai,' Kiah said.

'OK, talk to Adai. But he's far away on the Moon colony,' Rilla said. 'Let's visit Commander Zadak.'

'Zadak? Commander of Australia? He's famous!'

'Yes. He's my father's friend. He worked with my father in Brazil ten years ago. Perhaps he can help us.'

Kiah smiled. 'Good! We return to Earth next week. I can phone Adai from Kisangani and then we can go to Australia. But now, I'm hungry! Let's get some dinner.'

1 　人工臭氧层

OM-45号宇宙飞船在欧洲上空500公里的高度向北飞行。飞船尾部的一个房间里，凯注视着面前计算机屏幕上的数字。

“该吃饭了。”瑞拉叫他。

那些数字飞快地变换着，凯眼都不眨一下。瑞拉穿过房间走到他的桌旁。她也开始观察那些数字。

“卫星怎么了？”她问。她是个美丽的女孩，大约二十岁，黑黑的长发，大大的眼睛。

“卫星没问题，”凯平静地回答，“是人工臭氧层。”他伏在桌上，开始往一个本子上记录那些数字。

突然，那些数字停止了变换。凯望向瑞拉。“在欧洲上空，”他说，“已经开始了。人工臭氧层正在破裂。那上面本来就有大洞了，现在那些洞还在增大。”

“说得对，咱们现在去见塞鲁船长吧，待会儿再吃饭好吗？”

凯站起身。他身高几乎有两米，眼睛和头发都是黑色的。“好，走吧。”他说。

他们迅速朝塞鲁船长的房间走去。他们等在船长的门外。

“进来！”塞鲁船长喊道。她是个有张胖脸的小个子女人。“进来！喝点什么吗？”

“不用，谢谢，”凯说，“我想请您看看这些数字。”凯把自己的笔记本递给塞鲁船长。

塞鲁船长看了看那些数字。突然，她的脸色变了。“不，不，”她说，“我不想谈。时候不早了，我也累了。坐下喝点什么吧。”

凯和瑞拉坐了下来。塞鲁船长的房间里有一扇大窗子。凯透过窗子凝望黑色的天空。他看见了月亮。在黑色的天幕下月亮显得冰冷皎洁。

“塞鲁船长，”他开口了，“这事很重要。仔细看看那些数字。人工臭氧层正开始……”

“别说了。”塞鲁船长站起身把双手插进衣兜。她走到窗前注视着天空。

“300年前，地球几乎毁灭，”瑞拉说，“因为有人工臭氧层地球才幸免于难。但是现在，在欧洲上空，人工臭氧层正在破裂。我们希望您能和地球司令谈一谈。”

塞鲁船长没有动。“你还记得阿岱吗？”她问。不等回答，她接着说：“两年前我在他的船上。一天晚上卫星发回了关于人工臭氧层的一些不寻常的数据。我们回到地球去见地球司令。”塞鲁船长停了下来。

瑞拉看了一眼凯。“然后呢？”她问塞鲁船长。

“高格生气了，特别生气，”塞鲁船长说，“最后，他把阿岱分配到了月球。阿岱现在还在那儿，在月亮下面作月亮部族的司令。”

凯等了一两秒钟：“我知道阿岱的事。但是我们需要再和地球司令谈谈。这些数据比上次的还要糟。”

塞鲁船长的脸涨红了：“你不明白。我不会去跟高格说的。上次他把我发配到了南极的一艘气象飞船上。如今这是我第一艘待了两年的飞船。”塞鲁船长喝了一口水。

凯站起身：“谢谢您，塞鲁船长。”

塞鲁船长没说活。

凯和瑞拉出了门，脚步迟缓地下楼去了。飞船里寂静漆黑。8点钟了，大家都在吃饭。

“下一步咱们怎们办？”瑞拉问。

“我得跟阿岱谈谈。”凯说。

“好，跟阿岱谈谈。可是他现在在遥远的月亮部族，”瑞拉说，“咱们还是去见扎达克司令吧。”

“扎达克？澳大利亚司令？他很有名气呢！”

“是的，他是我父亲的朋友。10年前他和我父亲一起在巴西工作。也许他能帮忙。”

凯笑了，“好，咱们下周回地球。我可以在基桑加尼给阿岱打个电话，然后咱们就去澳大利亚。现在嘛，我可饿了。咱们吃饭去吧。”

2Visit to Australia

Visit to Australia

On Friday, after three weeks in space, Kiah and Rilla finished work and left Ship OM-45 on a space plane to Kisangani. Kiah phoned Adai and Rilla phoned Commander Zadak in Australia. The next morning they took an aeroplane to Sydney. A taxi took them from the airport to Commander Zadak's office, some kilometres north of Sydney.

'Wait for us here,' Kiah said to the taxi driver.

Kiah and Rilla walked to the gate. About ten guards stood in front of the gate. Across the road, a train waited.

'Rilla, OM-45,' Rilla said. 'To see Commander Zadak at four-thirty.'

'Let me call the Commander's office,' the guard said.

Kiah and Rilla waited. It was hot and Kiah began to feel thirsty.

The guard came back. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 'The Commander can't see you.'

'But I talked to the Commander yesterday,' Rilla said. 'He wanted to see us at four-thirty.'

'The Commander is leaving on the train in three minutes,' the guard said.

Can we wait and see him here?' Kiah asked.

'No!' the guard shouted. 'Get out of here!'

Kiah and Rilla walked back to the taxi.

'Where's the driver?' Kiah asked.

'Look! He's sitting by that wall,' Rilla said.

Just then, Commander Zadak came out of the gate. He was a very tall, big man with blue eyes and a lot of white hair. Two guards marched in front of him, and two guards marched behind him. They all carried guns.

'There he is!' Rilla cried. 'Commander!' And she began to run along the road to him.

Commander Zadak did not stop. A guard opened the door of the train and the Commander got in. Slowly, the train began to move.

Kiah ran to the taxi and jumped in. Then he drove the taxi fast down the road. The taxi driver saw him and ran after him. The train began to move faster. Suddenly, Kiah drove the taxi off the road. He drove in front of the train and stopped.

The train came nearer. And then the train stopped, very near the taxi, and some guards jumped off. Kiah opened the door and got out of the taxi.

'Put up your hands!' the guards shouted.

Two of the guards began to hit Kiah.

'Stop that!' someone shouted. 'Bring him over here!' It was Commander Zadak.

Kiah stood in front of the Commander. Just then, Rilla arrived.

'Oh, it's you!' Commander Zadak said. He did not smile. 'Rilla, your father's going to be angry.'

'We want to talk to you, Commander,' Rilla said. 'It's very important.'

'Very well. I'm listening.'

Kiah began to talk. 'Two years ago, Adai told you about the holes in the AOL. Now they're worse. The AOL is breaking up over Europe. Please look at these numbers and this satellite picture.'

He gave his book to Commander Zadak and the Commander looked at the numbers.

'It's important, Commander,' Kiah said. In ten years Earth is going to die.'

'You stopped my train because of this?' Commander Zadak asked. 'Two years ago Adai talked to me about the AOL. Then he talked to Earth Commander, and what happened? Where is Adai now? Is the Moon colony helping the AOL?'

'We know about Adai, Commander,' Rilla said. 'But someone needs to talk to Earth Commander again.'

'I'm going to talk to Gog about rain, I can tell you that. Earth needs rain: there was no rain last winter. Half of Australia has no water and my trees here are dying. Without rain, many people are going to die. Is Gog going to understand that? I don't know!'

Commander Zadak began to walk back to his train. 'Move that taxi!' he called to his guards.

Some guards moved the taxi back to the road and then they jumped on to the train again. The train began to move.

'OK,' the taxi driver shouted. 'What are you going to do next? Drive my taxi into the river?'

Kiah smiled. He took some money from his pocket and gave it to the taxi driver.

The taxi driver looked at the money. 'OK, OK,' he said. 'Where now? Back to the airport?'

Kiah took Rilla's hand, 'Yes,' he said. 'Let's get back to Kisangani. We can phone Adai again tomorrow.'

2 　访问澳大利亚

这是个星期五，凯和瑞拉已经在太空飞行了三周。他们结束了工作，离开OΜ-45号宇宙飞船，乘航天飞机飞往基桑加尼。凯和瑞拉分别跟阿岱和澳大利亚司令扎达克通了电话。第二天早晨他们乘飞机来到悉尼。一辆出租车把他们从机场带到了悉尼以北几公里以外的扎达克司令的办公室。

“在这儿等我们。”凯吩咐出租车司机。

凯和瑞拉朝大门走去。门前站着大约有十个卫兵。一辆火车正等在马路对面。

“我叫瑞拉，OM-45号的，”瑞拉说，“扎达克司令4点半要接见我们。”

“我给司令办公室打个电话。”卫兵说。

凯和瑞拉站在那儿等着。天气很热，凯开始感到口渴。

那个卫兵回来了。“对不起，”他说，“司令不能见你们。”

“可是我昨天跟司令说过，”瑞拉说，“他答应今天4点半见我们。”

“再过三分钟司令就要坐火车出发了。”卫兵说。

“我们能不能在这儿等着见他一面？”凯问。

“不行！”卫兵喊了起来，“出去！”

凯和瑞拉回到出租车那儿。

“司机哪去了？”凯问。

“那不是嘛！在墙边坐着呢。”瑞拉说。

正说着，扎达克司令出现在大门口。他高大魁梧，蓝眼睛，长着一头浓密的白发。四个卫兵两前两后阔步行进护卫着他。他们都带着枪。

“他在那儿！”瑞拉喊了起来，“扎达克司令！”她随即顺着马路朝他跑去。

扎达克司令并没有停下脚步。一个卫兵打开火车门，扎达克跨了进去。火车缓缓地开动了。

凯奔向那辆出租车，迅速坐进车里。随即他开着车飞快地顺路而下。出租车司机看见了他，在后面紧追不放。火车开始加速。突然，凯把出租车开下了马路。直驶到火车前头停了下来。

火车越来越近了。在就要撞到出租车的时候，它停了下来。几个卫兵从车厢里跳了下来。凯打开车门从出租车里出来。

“举起手来！”卫兵们朝他喊。

两个卫兵对凯一阵拳打脚踢。

“住手！”有人喊了一声，“把他带到这儿来！”是扎达克司令。

凯站到了司令面前。正在这时，瑞拉赶到了。

“噢，是你。”扎达克司令说话了。他不带一丝笑容：“瑞拉，你父亲会生气的。”

“我们想和您谈谈，司令，”瑞拉说，“这事非常重要。”

“说吧，我听着呢。”

凯开口了：“两年前阿岱曾跟您谈过人工臭氧层上的洞。现在情况更糟了。欧洲上空的人工臭氧层已经开裂。请您看看这些数据和这张卫星照片。”

他把笔记本递给扎达克司令，扎达克看了看本子上的数据。

“这事非常重要，司令，”凯说，“10年后地球就要毁灭了。”

“你们拦住我的火车就为这事？”扎达克司令问，“两年前阿岱跟我谈过人工臭氧层的事。然后他又跟地球司令谈了这件事。之后又怎么样了呢？阿岱现在在哪？月亮部族能帮助修复人工臭氧层吗？”

“我们知道阿岱的事，司令。”瑞拉说，“但是得有人再去跟地球司令谈谈。”

“我可以告诉你们，我正准备去跟高格谈谈雨水的事。地球需要雨水：去年冬天没下雨。澳大利亚有一半地区没有水，我们的树都要枯死了。假如没有水的话很多人都要活不下去了。高格会理解这一切吗？我不知道。”

扎达克司令朝他的火车走去。“把那辆出租车弄走！”他朝卫兵们喊。

几个卫兵把出租车推回到公路上，然后跳上了火车。火车启动了。

“好啊，”出租车司机喊道，“接下去你们还想干什么？把我的出租车开到河里去？”

凯笑了。他从衣兜里拿出一些钱递给出租车司机。

出租车司机看了看那些钱。“好吧，好吧。”他说，“现在去哪？回机场？”

凯拉住瑞拉的手。“是的，”他说，“咱们回基桑加尼去。我们明天再给阿岱打个电话。”

3Earth Commander

Earth Commander

The next day in Kisangani, Kiah and Rilla waited quietly in an office in Gog's house. Suddenly, Commander Zadak came into the office and gave some letters to the man behind the table. He saw the two young people and stopped in front of them.

'You again!' he said. 'What are you doing here?'

Kiah stood up. 'Good morning, Commander. We're here because we want to see Earth Commander.'

'I saw Earth Commander some minutes ago and talked to him about rain, 'Zadak said quietly. 'But he didn't listen. Your captain, Seru, was here earlier this morning and began to tell him about the holes in the AOL. But Gog doesn't want to hear about our planet. He's always talking about Mars. In the end, he's going to destroy Earth.'

'Please help us!' Rilla cried. 'Come and see Gog with us!'

'No.' Zadak looked at Kiah and then at Rilla with his blue eyes. 'I'm not talking to Gog again. And you—Gog isn't going to listen to you. Be careful—and good luck!'

Commander Zadak opened the door and left the office.

Rilla looked at Kiah. 'Earth Commander is a difficult man. I don't understand him.'

'Everyone is afraid of him, 'Kiah said. 'And Commander Zadak isn't going to help us.'

Kiah and Rilla waited. They waited and waited. At nearly twelve o'clock, a guard came into the office.

'Come!' he said.

Kiah and Rilla went with the guard. The house was big and old, with big windows and many doors. The guard went downstairs and opened one of the doors. There was nobody in the room.

'Wait here,' the guard said, and left.

Kiah and Rilla sat down on the expensive green and black chairs and looked at the expensive flowers on the tables. There were no windows in this room. Suddenly, the door opened and a tall, fat woman came in. Her name was Bel, and she was Gog's wife. She had a lot of long red hair and she wore an expensive blue dress. Bel liked expensive things. She carried a cat. The cat was black and white: half its face was black and half was white; half its body was black and half was white.

'Why are you here? Why do you want to see Earth Commander?' she asked.

Rilla stood up. 'How do you do?' she said. 'We want to talk to Earth Commander about the AOL. We have new numbers from the satellite.'

Bel's face was red. 'The AOL! Earth Commander knows about the AOL, and he is the best man—'

'Excuse me,' Kiah said quietly. 'We want to help Earth Commander.'

Bel began to laugh. 'Help? You?' The cat jumped down and walked across the room. 'How can you help? Why can't you understand? Listen. Earth Commander is working on the spaceship for Mars. It's difficult and expensive work.' The cat jumped on to Rilla's chair and looked at her with its yellow eyes. 'Two years ago, Adai wanted more money for the AOL—and Earth Commander sent him to the colony under the Moon. Now you're talking about the AOL. Do you want to go to the Moon, too?'

The door opened again and a different guard came in. 'Excuse me. Earth Commander is ready now.'

Bel stood up. 'You can see Earth Commander now,' she said coldly. 'But you're going to be sorry!'

The guard opened a different door, and Bel and the cat went into a beautiful room with expensive, very old tables and chairs. Rilla and Kiah went in behind them. There were no windows in the room, but a lot of pictures. There was Gog! The richest man on Earth; and the worst man on Earth. He was tall and fat, and without much hair. He sat behind a big table with a television, three computers and five telephones. He watched the television and didn't look at Kiah or Rilla. Two guards with guns stood behind him and two more guards stood near the door.

'Here they are!' Bel said. 'They aren't friends, oh no! They want to talk about the AOL, of course. No one understands about Mars—'

'That's all right, that's all right,' Gog said quickly. And then he looked up, first at Rilla and then at Kiah. His eyes were cold and green. 'I know about you two,' he said. 'Your captain told me about you. You're famous! Two children! You want to help planet Earth, is that right?' He waited. The cat jumped on to his table and sat down in front of the television.

'Yes, Commander,' Kiah began. 'The AOL is breaking up—'

'When? Tonight? Tomorrow?' Gog said angrily. 'I heard this old story two years ago, from Adai. Everyone comes here and wants money—money for the AOL, money for rain, money for the Moon colony. But I am Earth Commander, and you are nobody! I know about the AOL and the AOL is good for a hundred years!'

'But the satellite—' Kiah began again.

'Be quiet!' Gog cried. 'I am Earth Commander! I'm not going to give money for the AOL! Or for rain! Or for the Moon!' Gog looked at the guards near the door. 'Take them— take them away. I don't want to hear them.'

The guards moved behind Kiah and Rilla, and Bel began to laugh. 'Goodbye!' she said. 'You're not going to the Moon, you're going to prison! You can talk about the holes in the AOL there!'

3 　地球司令

第二天在基桑加尼，凯和瑞拉在高格住处的一间办公室里静静地等待着。突然，扎达克司令走进办公室，递给办公桌后面的那个人一些信件。他看见了两个年轻人，在他们面前站住了。

“又是你们！”他说，“你们在这儿干嘛？”

凯站了起来：“早晨好，司令。我们来这儿是为了见地球司令。”

“几分钟前我见到了地球司令，还跟他谈了雨水的事。”扎达克平静地说，“但是他不听。你们塞鲁船长今天早晨来过，并且告诉他人工臭氧层有了洞。可是髙格不想听我们这颗星球的事。他总是谈论火星。最终他会毁了地球。”

“请您帮帮我们！”瑞拉喊着，“和我们一起去见见高格吧！”

“不，”扎达克用他蓝蓝的眼睛看了看凯，又看了看瑞拉，“我不会再跟高格谈了。而你们——高格不会听你们的。小心点——祝你们好运！”

扎达克司令打开房门走出了办公室。

瑞拉看了看凯：“地球司令是个不好相处的人。我真不知道他是怎么想的。”

“大家都怕他，”凯说，“扎达克司令也不准备帮助我们。”

凯和瑞拉等待着。他们等啊等。快12点时，一个卫兵走进办公室。

“来吧。”他说。

凯和瑞拉跟在卫兵后面。这是座宽敞的旧房子，有巨大的窗户，许多扇门。卫兵下了楼，打开了一扇门。房间里一个人也没有。

“在这儿等着。”卫兵说了一句就离开了。

凯和瑞拉在昂贵的绿黑相间的椅子上坐了下来，观赏着桌子上那些名贵的鲜花。这个房间没有窗子。突然，门开了，一个身高体胖的女人走了进来。她叫贝尔，是高格的妻子。她有一头浓密的红色长发，穿着一件昂贵的蓝色裙子。贝尔喜欢昂贵的东西。她抱着一只猫。那是只黑白相间的猫：猫脸一半黑一半白；猫身也是一半黑一半白。

“你们来这儿干嘛？你们为什么要见地球司令？”她问。

瑞拉站起身。“你好，”她说，“我们要和地球司令谈谈人工臭氧层的事。我们从卫星上获得了新数据。”

贝尔的脸涨红了：“人工臭氧层！地球司令知道人工臭氧层的事。他是最——“

“对不起，”凯平静地说，“我们想帮助地球司令。”

贝尔笑了：“帮助？你们？”那只猫跳了下来走到房间的另一头。“你们怎么帮他？你们怎么不明白呢？听着，地球司令正忙着制造去火星的飞船。这可是既费力又费钱的工作。”那只猫跳到瑞拉的椅子上，黄色的眼睛盯着她。“两年前，阿岱想为人工臭氧层要更多的钱——地球司令把他送到了月亮下面的部族。现在你们又在谈人工臭氧层，你们也想到月亮那儿去吗？”

门又开了，另一个卫兵走了进来：“对不起，地球司令可以接见了。”

贝尔站起身。“你们现在可以去见地球司令了，”她冷冰冰地说，“可你们会后悔的！”

卫兵打开另外一扇门，贝尔和那只猫走进一个摆满非常古老、昂贵的桌椅的漂亮房间。瑞拉和凯跟在他们后面。这间屋子也没有窗户，墙上挂满了图画。高格就在里面！这个世界上最富也最坏的人。他又高又胖，头发稀疏。他坐在一张大桌子后面，桌上放着一台电视，三台电脑，五部电话。只见他注视着电视屏幕，根本不看凯和瑞拉。两个持枪的卫兵站在他身后，还有两个站在门边。

“他们来了，”贝尔说，“他们不是朋友，噢，不是。当然，他们要谈谈人工臭氧层的事。没人懂得火星——”

“行了，行了，”高格快速地打断她。之后他抬起头看看瑞拉又看看凯。那是一双冷漠的绿眼睛。“我知道你们俩，”他说，“你们船长跟我说起过你们。你们名气不小啊！两个孩子！你们想拯救地球，是不是？”他等着回答。那只猫跳上他的桌子坐在电视机前。

“是的，司令，”凯开口了，“人工臭氧层正在破裂——”

“什么时候？今天晚上？明天？”高格生气地说，“两年前我就听阿岱说过这个老掉牙的故事。每个人都到这儿来要钱——为人工臭氧层，为下雨的事，为月亮部族。但是我是地球司令，你们什么也不是！我知道人工臭氧层，它能坚持一百年！”

“可是卫星——”凯又开口了。

“少废话！”高格叫了起来，“我是地球司令！我不会为人工臭氧层花钱！也不为下雨的事花钱！也不为月亮！”高格看了一眼门口的卫兵，“把他们——把他们带走。我不想听他们讲话。”

卫兵们在凯和瑞拉身后行动起来，贝尔笑了。“再见了！”她说，“你们不会去月球，你们要去监狱！你们可以在那儿谈论人工臭氧层上的洞！”

4Prison 888

Prison 888

Commander Zadak was in his room at the biggest hotel in Kisangani. Suddenly, he heard the phone.

'Commander?' someone said, very quietly. 'A man and a woman—from Ship OM-45—in prison 888.' The phone went dead. Zadak put the phone down, stood up, and left his room.

Prison 888 was a big white building without windows, near Gog's house. There were a lot of guards at the gate, and some more guards marched past the building. All the guards carried guns.

Commander Zadak walked across the road to the prison. 'I want to visit someone. My name is Commander Zadak.'

'I'm sorry, Commander,' a guard said. 'We can't open the gate. Nobody can go in without a letter from Earth Commander.'

'That's all right,' Zadak said, and walked along the road, past the prison.

A guard ran behind him. 'Excuse me, Commander,' he said quickly. 'Please come back tonight. I can open the back gate at midnight. You can see the two people from Ship OM-45.'

Zadak looked at the guard. 'Your captain's going to kill you.'

The guard smiled. 'My captain phoned you about the two people from OM-45. He's the brother of Captain Seru.'

Zadak didn't smile. 'The prison commander is going to kill you and your captain.'

'It doesn't matter,' the guard said. 'We want to help.'

'Midnight,' Zadak said, and walked away.

At midnight there were four guards at the front gate of prison 888, and there was one guard at the back gate. The guard opened the gate and Zadak went in. The guard said nothing. They walked downstairs into a big room. A lot of prisoners slept on the floor because there were no beds or chairs. Kiah and Rilla sat on the floor near the door.

'You can talk for five minutes,' the guard said quietly. 'The next guard arrives at 12.15.'

Kiah and Rilla stood up. 'Good evening, Commander,' they said.

Zadak looked at the prisoners. 'Why are all these people here?' he said to Kiah and Rilla. 'They're in prison because Gog doesn't like them. I talk to Gog about rain, I talk to him about the AOL, but he never listens. Today, someone told me about some fires in the new forest here in Africa; but Gog doesn't want to hear about those fires.' Zadak laughed angrily. 'And he doesn't want to hear about my trees in Australia. He never listens to me. He's always thinking about Mars, Not about our beautiful planet Earth.'

Kiah listened carefully. 'Take it easy, Commander,' he said quietly. 'Please talk to Adai. Adai wants to help. He can come back from the Moon and help you.'

'No,' Zadak said. 'I phoned Adai this afternoon. He's a good man and he wants to help. But I don't need help. I'm going to stop Gog: I'm going to kill him.'

Kiah closed his eyes for a minute. 'Gog's guards have guns. They can kill you, Commander,' he said. 'You need more people to help. Wait for Adai. He can help you to look for more people.'

'No, Kiah,' Zadak said quietly. I don't want more people. Adai can come back to Earth after Gog is dead—after I am dead, perhaps. I don't want Adai to die, too.'

'Excuse me, Commander,' the guard said. He looked at the clock near the door.

'OK. Let's go,' Zadak said to the guard. He looked at Rilla and then at Kiah. His eyes were very blue. 'Goodbye,' he said.

'Goodbye, Commander,' Kiah said.

'Be careful!' Rilla cried. 'And good luck!'

Early that morning, Earth Commander's house was quiet.

A guard opened the door.

'Good morning, Commander Zadak,' he said. 'Earth Commander isn't in his office.'

'That's all right,' Zadak said. 'I can wait.'

Zadak went upstairs and waited.

At eight o'clock Bel came into the room. 'Good morning, Commander,' she said. 'You're early this morning. Are you happier today? Earth Commander was very angry with you yesterday. Don't begin talking about rain or the AOL today.'

Zadak smiled, but his blue eyes were cold. 'No,' he said. 'I'm not going to talk about rain today.'

Just then, Gog came into the room. He looked at Zadak. 'What's wrong? Why are you here at eight o'clock in the morning?'

Zadak took his gun from his pocket. Gog saw the gun and his face went white. His eyes were dark and afraid. For a second nobody moved.

Suddenly, Bel's black and white cat ran into the room.

'Guards! Guards!' Bel shouted.

The cat jumped at Zadak, and Zadak hit the cat away from him. Bel ran across the room to Gog and Zadak, at that second, shot at Gog. But Bel was between him and Gog. She gave a cry and fell to the floor. Her hair looked very red on the black floor.

'No!' 'Gog cried. 'You shot Bel!'

Three guards ran into the room with their big guns and stood in front of Gog.

'Kill him!' Gog shouted, and began to help Bel.

Zadak looked at the guards and then at Bel and Gog. Kiah was right: he was going to die.

'I'm sorry, Kiah. I'm sorry, Adai,' he said quietly.

The guards shot Zadak. Slowly, he fell to the floor.

4 　888号监狱

在基桑加尼最大的饭店，扎达克司令正待在他的房间里。突然，电话铃响了。

“司令吗？”有人非常平静地说，“一个男的和一个女的——从OM-45号飞船上来的——正在888号监狱里。”电话挂断了。扎达克放下听筒，站起身，离开了他的房间。

888号监狱座落在高格家附近，是座没有窗户的高大的白色建筑。监狱门口有许多卫兵，另外还有一些卫兵从监狱前走过。所有的卫兵都带着枪。

扎达克司令穿过马路来到监狱门前，说道：“我是扎达克司令。我要见一个人。”

“对不起，司令，”一个卫兵说，“我们不能开门。没有地球司令的信谁也不能进去。”

“好吧，”扎达克说。他顺着马路从监狱旁边绕了过去。

一个卫兵从后面赶了上来。“对不起，司令，”他说得很快，“请您今天晚上来吧。午夜的时候我可以打开后门。您能见到从OM-45号宇宙飞船来的那两个人。”

扎达克注视着那个卫兵：“你们队长会杀了你的。”

那个卫兵笑了：“是我们队长给您打电话，告诉您OM-45号那两个人的事的。他是塞鲁船长的哥哥。”

扎达克没有笑：“监狱长会把你和你们队长都杀掉的。”

“没关系，”那个卫兵说，“我们愿意帮忙。”

“午夜。”扎达克说了一声就走了。

午夜时分，888号监狱正门前有四个卫兵，还有一个卫兵守在后门。那个卫兵打开后门，扎达克走了进去。卫兵什么也没说。他们走下楼梯进了一个大房间。那个房间里没有床也没有椅子，许多犯人睡在地板上。凯和瑞拉坐在门边的地板上。

“你们可以谈五分钟，”那个卫兵悄悄说，“下一班卫兵12点一刻来。”

凯和瑞拉站起身：“晚上好，司令。”他们说。

扎达克看了看那些犯人：“这些人为什么被关在这儿？”他对凯和瑞拉说道，“高格不喜欢他们，所以把他们关了起来。我跟高格说了下雨的事，还有人工臭氧层的事，可是他根本不听。今天有人告诉我非洲那些幼林失火了，可是高格根本不想听火灾的事。”扎达克愤怒地冷笑了一声：“他也不想知道澳大利亚我那些树林的事。他从来不听我的。他总想着火星，从来不想想我们美丽的地球。”

凯认真听着。“别太在意，司令，”他平静地说，“请您和阿岱谈谈。他会帮忙的。他可以从月球回来帮助您。”

“不行，”扎达克说，“今天下午我给他打了电话。他是个好人，也愿意帮忙。可我不需要帮助。我要阻止高格——我要杀了他。”

凯闭目凝神了一会儿。“高格的卫兵有枪。他们会杀了您的，司令。”他说，“您需要多一些人帮忙。等等阿岱。他能帮您找更多的人。”

“不，凯，”扎达克平静地说，“我不想要更多的人。阿岱可以在高格死了以后——也许我死了以后再回来。我不希望阿岱也来送死。”

“对不起，司令。”那个卫兵说。他看了看门边挂着的钟。

“好吧，咱们走。”扎达克对卫兵说。他看了看瑞拉又看了看凯。他的双眼晶莹碧蓝。“再见了。”他说。

“再见，司令。”凯说。

“要小心！”瑞拉喊着，“祝您好运！”

那天清晨，地球司令的家里非常安静。一个卫兵打开房门。

“早晨好，扎达克司令，”他说，“地球司令不在办公室。”

“没关系，”扎达克说，“我可以等。”

扎达克来到楼上开始等待。

8点钟的时候贝尔走了进来。“早晨好，司令，”她说，“今天您可真早。您今天高兴点了吗？地球司令昨天跟您发了很大的火。今天可别上来就谈什么雨水或者人工臭氧层的事了。”

扎达克笑了，可他的蓝眼睛里透着寒光。“不会的，”他说，“今天我不准备谈雨水的事。”

正说着，高格走了进来。他看着扎达克：“这是怎么了？你为什么早晨8点钟就来这儿？”

扎达克从衣兜里掏出了枪。高格看见了那支枪，脸色煞白。他目光灰暗，充满恐惧。一时间大家都僵在了那儿。

突然，贝尔那只黑白相间的猫跑了进来。

“卫兵！卫兵！”贝尔喊了起来。

那只猫朝扎达克扑过来，扎达克把猫抡到一边。贝尔朝房间另一头的高格跑去，就在这时，扎达克朝高格开枪了。可是贝尔正好跑到他和高格之问。她叫了一声就倒在了地板上。在黑色地板的映衬下她的头发显得越发红艳。

“不！”高格大喊，“你打死了贝尔！”

三个拿着长枪的卫兵跑了进来，站在高格前面。

“杀了他！”高格叫着，一边去救贝尔。

扎达克看了看那几个卫兵，又看了看贝尔和高格。凯说得对：他活不成了。

“凯，阿岱，我对不起你们。”他平静地说。

卫兵们朝扎达克开了枪。他缓缓地倒在地板上。

5Forest fires

Forest fires

Later that morning, four guards took Rilla to Gog's office. His face looked tired and his eyes were red.

'Leave us,' he said to the guards. Then he looked at Rilla. 'Tell me about Kiah. When did you first meet him? Is Zadak his friend? What do they talk about?'

Rilla looked down at the floor and said nothing.

'Come on, tell me!' Gog said angrily. He waited, but Rilla said nothing. 'Tell me about Zadak, then. Your father and Commander Zadak were friends. Now, you're talking to Zadak about the AOL. I know that. What is Zadak saying?'

'Why? Why do you want to know about Commander Zadak?' Rilla asked.

'I'm asking the questions, not you,' Gog said. 'Did you see Zadak yesterday?'

'The AOL is important, not Commander Zadak,' Rilla said.

Gog watched Rilla carefully. 'Zadak is dead.'

'No!' Rilla cried.

'He is dead,' Gog said again. 'You lost your friend, here in this building, early this morning. My guards shot him.'

Rilla's face went white, 'What happened? Tell me!'

'I'm going to tell you one thing,' Gog said angrily. 'I'm going to destroy Australia. I'm going to burn Zadak's new forest there. You can tell all your friends! Zadak wanted to kill me, but I killed him. He wanted money for rain, money for the AOL, and now he's dead. You can tell all those prisoners in prison 888. They wanted to stop me, but they can't now. I'm going to Mars! Bel always wanted to go to Mars.' He began to hit the table with his hand. 'I'm going to leave this dead planet! Nobody can stop me!'

'You're crazy,' Rilla said. 'You killed Zadak, but one day someone is going to kill you.'

Gog stood up. His face was tired and he looked ill. 'Be quiet!' he said. 'Guards! Take her away. Back to 888.'

The guards came in and took Rilla out.

'What happened?' she asked them. 'Commander Zadak is dead; why is Gog angry?'

The guards said nothing. But after they returned to the gate of 888, a guard said to Rilla, very quietly: 'Bel is dead. Zadak didn't shoot Gog, but he shot Bel, before the guards shot him.'

A guard. took Rilla into the prison, and soon she was with Kiah again.

'What happened?' Kiah asked. 'Tell me.'

Rilla put her hands over her face and began to cry. 'Zadak is dead,' she began. 'He didn't kill Gog. He killed Bel before the guards shot him, and now Gog is going to destroy Australia.'

Kiah sat down on the floor next to Rilla. His face was sad. 'Don't cry,' he said quietly.

Three or four prisoners came across the room.

'What's the matter?' they asked.

'Zadak is dead,' Kiah said. 'But Bel is dead, too.'

'What's going to happen next?' someone asked. But nobody answered.

The next afternoon, Captain Seru's brother took Kiah and Rilla to a little room at the back of the prison.They sat down, and five minutes later Captain Seru arrived. Nobody smiled.

'You were right, Captain,' Kiah said. 'Gog sent us to prison because we told him about the holes in the AOL.'

Seru smiled. 'You were right, Kiah,' she said. 'Those satellite numbers were very bad. I began to tell Gog, but he didn't listen to me.'

'Would you like some coffee? And some sandwiches?' Seru's brother asked.

'Yes, please,' Seru said. 'I'm hungry.' She looked at Kiah and Rilla. 'Things are very bad.'

'What's happening?' Rilla asked.

'You know about Zadak? And Bel?'

'Yes. Gog told Rilla yesterday,' Kiah said.

Seru smiled, but her eyes were not happy. 'Gog talked to me this morning,' she said. Her brother came in with the coffee and sandwiches and Seru began to eat. 'Gog wants to know about Zadak, and about you,' she said. 'He's going to kill us all, I think, before he goes to Mars.'

Suddenly, Rilla felt ill. 'I can't eat now!' she cried. But she took some coffee and began to drink. 'Let's get out of here,' she said. 'Perhaps we can get a plane to Brazil and go to my family.'

'Difficult,' Seru said. 'Last night fires began in the new forest in Europe, and they're moving across Europe. The fires in Africa are burning fast. Gog began to destroy Zadak's forest in Australia yesterday.'

'Did you phone Adai?' Kiah asked.

'Adai! You never stop talking about Adai. What can he do?' Rilla said. She felt angry.

Seru looked at Rilla for a minute. 'Yes, I phoned Adai before I came here. I told him about Zadak and Bel, and about the fires. He asked about you, Kiah. He can't come down at Kisangani airport because Gog is there with a lot of his guards. Ship MARS 4 is nearly ready and Gog is watching it. He wants to leave Earth tomorrow.'

'How can Adai help us?' Rilla asked. 'He can't shoot all the guards here.'

Captain Seru finished the last sandwich. 'Let's leave that to Adai,' she said. 'We can do nothing.'

'Are you going to stay here?' Kiah asked.

'Yes,' Seru answered. 'Adai is coming to the prison after he arrives on Earth.'

'Oh yes?' Rilla said tiredly. 'But when? Gog can kill us before Adai comes.'

'No, he can't,' Seru's brother said. 'You can stay here, in this room. Gog's guards are all afraid—afraid of the fires, afraid of the people. They aren't going to look for you here.'

5 　森林大火

那天上午发生了这些事情之后，四个卫兵把瑞拉带到了高格的办公室。高格一脸疲惫，眼睛红红的。

“出去吧。”他吩咐卫兵。之后他盯着瑞拉：“跟我说说凯。你第一次见到他是什么时候？扎达克是他的朋友吗？他们都谈些什么呢？”

瑞拉低头看着地板，一言不发。

“说呀，告诉我！”高格生气地喊。他等待着，瑞拉仍旧什么也没说。“那就说说扎达克吧。你爸爸和扎达克司令是朋友。现在你把人工臭氧层的事告诉了他。我知道这些。扎达克他怎么说？”

“为什么？为什么你想知道扎达克司令的事？”瑞拉问。

“是我在提问，不是你，”高格说，“昨天你见到扎达克了吗？”

“人工臭氧层才是重要的，不是扎达克司令。”瑞拉说。

高格凝视着瑞拉：“扎达克死了。”

“不！”瑞拉叫了起来。

“他死了，”高格重复了一遍，“你失去了你的朋友，就在这座楼里，就在今天清晨。我的卫兵开枪打死了他。”

瑞拉的脸白了：“出了什么事？告诉我！”

“有一件事我得告诉你，”高格恼怒地说，“我要毁掉澳大利亚。我要把扎达克新栽的森林烧毁，你可以告诉你所有的朋友。扎达克想杀死我，可我杀了他。他想为下雨的事，为人工臭氧层要钱，可现在他死了。你可以告诉888号监狱里所有的人。他们想阻止我，可现在他们不可能了。我要去火星！贝尔一直想去火星的。”他用手敲打着桌面，“我要离开这个死亡的星球！没人能阻拦我！”

“你疯了，”瑞拉说，“你杀了扎达克，但总有一天也会有人把你杀掉的。”

高格站起身。他面色疲惫，憔悴不堪。“住嘴！”他喊着，“卫兵！把她带走。带回888号监狱去。”

卫兵们把瑞拉带了出去。

“出了什么事？”她问他们，“扎达克司令死了，高格为什么那么生气？”

卫兵们什么也没说。可是到了888号监狱门口，一个卫兵小声告诉瑞拉：“贝尔死了。扎达克没打着高格，可他打死了贝尔，然后卫兵才朝扎达克开的枪。”

一个卫兵把瑞拉带进监狱，很快瑞拉就回到了凯身边。

“出了什么事？”凯问，“告诉我。”

瑞拉捂着脸哭了起来。“扎达克死了，”她说，“他没能杀死高格。他打死贝尔之后那些卫兵杀了他，现在高格要毁掉澳大利亚。”

凯在瑞拉身边坐了下来。“别哭了。”他轻轻对瑞拉说，脸上流露出悲伤的神情。

三四个犯人走了过来。

“出了什么事？”他们问。

“扎达克死了，”凯说，“贝尔也死了。”

“以后还会出什么事呢？”一个人问。可是没人回答。

第二天下午，塞鲁船长的哥哥把凯和瑞拉带到监狱后面的一个小房间。他们坐了下来，5分钟后，塞鲁船长来了。大家都很严肃。

“船长，不出您所料，"凯说，“我们告诉高格人工臭氧层有洞的事，他就把我们送进了监狱。”

塞鲁笑了。“你说得对，凯，”她说，“那些卫星数据的确很糟糕。我试着跟高格说，可他根本不听我的。”

“要点咖啡吗？还有三明治？”塞鲁的哥哥问。

“好吧，要一点，”塞鲁说，“我饿了。”她看着凯和瑞拉：“情况非常糟糕。”

“出了什么事？”瑞拉问。

“你知道扎达克的事吗？还有贝尔？”

“瑞拉知道，高格昨天告诉她了。”凯说。

塞鲁笑了，可她的目光中却没有喜悦的神情。“高格今天早晨跟我谈过了。”她说。她哥哥拿着咖啡和三明治走了进来，塞鲁边吃边说：“高格想知道关于扎达克的情况，他也想知道关于你们的情况。”她说，“我想，他要把我们大家都杀掉，然后再去火星。”

突然，瑞拉感到很难受。“我现在吃不下去！”她喊着，一边倒了杯咖啡喝起来。“咱们出去吧，”她说，“也许我们能搭上去巴西的飞机回我家去。”

“很困难，”塞鲁说，“昨天夜里欧洲的新森林起了火，火势正向整个欧洲蔓延。非洲的大火越烧越猛。昨天高格开始摧毁扎达克在澳大利亚的森林。”

“你给阿岱打电话了吗？”凯问。

“阿岱！你怎么老是说起他，他能干什么呢？”瑞拉非常生气。

塞鲁注视了一阵瑞拉：“是的，我来之前给阿岱打过电话。我告诉了他扎达克和贝尔的事，还有火灾。他还问到你，凯。他不能降落在基桑加尼机场，因为髙格在那儿，他还布置了许多士兵。火星4号宇宙飞船已经基本准备就绪，高格正密切关注着它的进展。他想明天离开地球。”

“阿岱怎么帮助我们呢？”瑞拉问，“他也不能把这儿所有的卫兵都打死。”

塞鲁船长吃完了最后一个三明治。“这个问题就留给阿岱吧，”她说，“我们什么也做不了。”

“您准备待在这儿吗？”凯问。

“是的，”塞鲁说，“阿岱抵达地球之后就会到这座监狱来的。”

“噢，真的吗？”瑞拉疲惫地说，“可是什么时候呢？阿岱来之前高格就会把我们杀了。”

“不，他不会，”塞鲁的哥哥说，“你们可以待在这儿，在这个房间里。髙格的卫兵都害怕——怕那些火灾；怕那些人。他们不会到这儿来找你们的。”

6Spaceship to the Moon

Spaceship to the Moon

And so they waited. And waited. Rilla slept in her chair. Kiah and Seru talked quietly. Seru's brother came and went. Most of the prison guards ran away with the prisoners. Seven or eight people—some prisoners and some guards—didn't want to run away, so they came into the room and waited, too.

Ten o'clock came, then eleven o'clock. It was very quiet. Seru walked up and down the room. Kiah sat next to Rilla. Seru's brother came into the room again.

'It's after midnight,' he said.

Just then, they heard the noise of a plane. Kiah stood up. 'Come on,' he said. 'Let's get out of the building.'

Quietly, they left the building. It was a dark, hot night. There were no guards in front of the prison, so they went to the gate and waited there. Suddenly, they saw the plane. It was a little plane, and it came down on the road in front of the prison!

Rilla took Kiah's hand. 'You were right,' she said. 'I'm sorry.'

Kiah smiled. He began to feel happy. 'That's all right. I understand. I know Adai very well, and you don't.'

The plane stopped and someone opened the door. Kiah ran across to the plane.

'How many can you take?' he called. 'There are twelve of us.'

'That's all right,' someone said. 'Quickly, the spaceship is waiting.'

The twelve people got into the little plane, and the plane began to move. Rilla looked at the captain of the plane. He was tall, with brown hair. He looked nice. Was this the famous Commander Adai?

'Where is the spaceship?' Kiah asked.

'At the old airport,' the man said. 'One of the fires is moving very quickly across the new forest. It's going to arrive at the west of Kisangani before tomorrow, I think. But the old airport is OK.' Then the man looked at Kiah and smiled warmly. 'My brother,' he said. 'My little brother, in prison 888!'

'Your brother? Commander Adai?' Rilla asked. 'But you didn't tell me that!'

Kiah smiled. 'Nobody knew,' he said. 'But now—it doesn't matter now. Everyone can know.'

The little plane came down at the old airport, south of the town.

'Let's be careful,' Adai said. 'We don't want someone to shoot us before we leave.

The spaceship was dark. Quickly, everyone jumped down from the plane and ran across to the spaceship. Soon, the spaceship left Earth, and everyone looked down at the burning planet. They saw the dark smoke over Africa, and here and there, through the smoke, the red, angry fires.

'The fires are destroying the forest very quickly,' Seru said.

Adai put his hand on Kiah's arm. 'I'm sorry about Zadak,' he said.

'I wanted him to wait,' Kiah said. 'I wanted him to talk to you.'

Adai's face was sad. 'He didn't want me to die,' he said quietly. 'He was a good man. And now he's dead.'

'And Gog is going to Mars,' Seru said.

'Mars? He's crazy! Mars isn't ready for people,' Adai said.

'But Gog wants to go, and so he's going,' Seru said. 'Tell us about the Moon colony. That isn't ready: you need more money.'

'No, I don't,' Adai said. 'The Moon colony is ready. I asked for more money because of Zadak: I wanted to give him money for rain. But Gog didn't listen; he wanted all Earth's money for the spaceship to Mars.'

'I don't want to leave Earth,' Rilla said sadly. She felt tired and afraid.

Adai smiled warmly at Rilla. 'Nobody wants to leave Earth,' he said. 'But under the Moon is the best home for us now. Wait and see. The Moon colony is a beautiful, wonderful country, with rivers and rain, forests and flowers, buildings—and the first town. You can visit Earth again soon, and bring more people to the Moon colony. We all want to help Earth, because it's our first home. I know that. At the same time, you are going to be happy under the Moon.'

Suddenly, someone cried: 'Look at the Moon!'

And through the window of the spaceship they saw the Moon before them, cold, white and beautiful; and under the Moon, there was the Moon colony!

6 　飞往月球的宇宙飞船

于是他们等待着。等了又等。瑞拉蜷在她的椅子里睡着了。凯和塞鲁悄悄地谈着什么。塞鲁的哥哥进来一趟又出去了。监狱里的大部分卫兵都和犯人一起逃走了。只有大约七八个人——包括犯人和卫兵，不愿意逃走，于是也到这个房间里一起等待。

10点钟，11点钟。房间里安静极了。塞鲁在房间里走来走去。凯坐在瑞拉身边。塞鲁的哥哥又走了进来。

“已经过了午夜了。”他说。

就在这时，他们听到一阵飞机的轰鸣。凯站起身。“来啊，”他说，“咱们到楼外面去。”

他们悄悄地离开了大楼。这是个漆黑闷热的夜晚。监狱前面没有卫兵，于是他们来到大门口，在那儿等着。突然，他们看到了一架飞机。那是一架小飞机降落在了监狱门前的马路上！

瑞拉抓住凯的手。“你说得对，”她说，“我很抱歉。“

凯笑了。他高兴起来：“没关系，我明白。我非常了解阿岱，而你并不了解他。”

那架飞机停了下来，有人打开了舱门。凯朝飞机跑了过去。

“你们能带多少人？”他喊着，“我们一共12个人。”

“没问题，”有人答道，“快点，宇宙飞船正等着呢。”

12个人都上了那架小飞机，飞机启动了。瑞拉看了看机长。他身材髙大，头发是棕色的。这个人看上去很不错。他是不是那位著名的阿岱司令？

“宇宙飞船在哪儿？”凯问。

“那个旧机场，”那人说，“一股大火正飞速掠过新森林。我想明天之前这火就会烧到基桑加尼西部。好在那个旧机场还能用。”说完，那人注视着凯，脸上带着亲切的笑容。“我的弟弟，”他说，“我的小弟弟，住进了888号监狱！”

“他是你哥哥？阿岱司令？”瑞拉问，“可你从来没跟我说过！”

凯笑了。“以前没人知道，”他说，“可是现在——现在没关系了。大家都可以知道。”

小飞机在城南的旧机场降落了。

“咱们要小心，”阿岱说，“可不能在出发之前中了别人的枪子儿。”

宇宙飞船笼罩在一片黑暗中。大家迅速跳下飞机朝飞船跑去。很快，飞船离开了地球，大家俯视着下面这颗燃烧着的星球。他们看到了非洲上空的黑烟，以及黑烟下面到处肆虐着的愤怒的火红烈焰。

“大火很快就会把森林烧毁。”塞鲁说。

阿岱把手搭在凯的臂膀上。“扎达克的事真让我难过。”他说。

“我曾希望他再等等，”凯说，“我本来想让他和你谈谈。”

阿岱神情悲切。“他不想让我送死，”他低声说，“他是个好人。可现在他死了。”

“还有，高格要到火星去。”塞鲁船长说。

“火星？他疯了！火星还不能住人。”阿岱说。

“可高格要去，他马上就要出发了。”塞鲁说，“跟我们讲讲月亮部族吧。它还不成形，你还需要很多钱。”

“不，我不需要，”阿岱说，“月亮部族已经准备就绪。我要更多的钱是为了扎达克：我想给他钱解决雨水的问题。可是高格不听；他要把地球所有的钱都用在去火星的宇宙飞船上。”

“我不想离开地球。”瑞拉忧伤地说。她感到又累又恐惧。

阿岱对瑞拉温和地笑了笑。“没有人愿意离开地球，”他说，“可是现在我们最好的家园在月亮下面。等着看吧。月亮部族是个美丽迷人的国家，有河流，有雨水，也有森林和鲜花，还有楼房——以及第一座城镇。你很快就可以再回到地球去。然后带更多的人到月亮部族去。我们都想帮助地球，因为它是我们的第一个家。我理解你。同时，你也一定会在月亮下面生活得愉快的。”

突然，有人喊了一声：“快看月亮！”

透过飞船的窗子，他们看到了眼前的月球：冰冷，皎洁，美丽；而在月亮下面，他们看到了月亮部族！

简介

17世纪的时候，英格兰有许多人相信巫术。巫师可能是一个老太婆，或是一个年轻女子——有时甚至会是一个成年男子或小男孩。不过，巫师通常都是女人。人们都害怕巫师，因为巫师仅凭一句诅咒就能使人丧命。

1612年，在兰开夏郡的潘德尔山附近住着一个名叫詹妮特·迪瓦斯的小女孩。那时她刚9岁，因家里穷时常饿肚子，长得很瘦弱。她缺衣少鞋，有时一连几天吃不上饭。生活对于她来说十分艰难。

詹妮特的外祖母老德姆代克是一个巫师。她的母亲伊丽莎白和她的姐姐艾丽森也都是巫师。就连她可怜兮兮、傻头傻脑的哥哥詹姆斯也是巫师……不管怎样，村民们是这样认为的。

本书以女主人公詹妮特的口吻来讲述她一家人的故事。故事从1634年讲起，当时詹妮特被关押在兰开斯特城堡监狱里……

作者罗伊娜·艾金耶米是英国人，曾在非洲生活多年，现在在剑桥市工作、生活。她的这一有关潘德尔巫师的故事取材于发生在兰开夏郡的真实事件。

1THE PEDLAR

THE PEDLAR

The spring of 1634 arrives, but in the prison of Lancaster Castle it stays cold. The twenty women in the prison are dirty, hungry and cold. There are no beds or chairs and so they sleep on the cold floor. There are no windows, so it is always dark. The women want to get out of the prison; they want to go home. Sometimes the guards open the big, old door and put some bread and water on the floor. Then they close the door again.

My name is Jennet Device, and I am one of the twenty women in prison. Day after day, I sit on the cold floor and wait. I want to feel warm again; I want to see the sky again, and Pendle Hill, the beautiful hill near my home. But I am in the dark prison of Lancaster Castle, and I sit on the cold floor and wait.

One day, something happens. The guards open the big, old door. 'Jennet Device!' a guard calls. 'Come here at once, witch! Somebody wants to see you.'

I get up slowly because I'm very cold and I walk across the dark room to the door. Perhaps it's someone from Read Hall! Perhaps I'm going home!

'Jennet Device, be quick!' the guard calls again.

Someone is standing at the door with the guard. 'Jennet,' he says quietly.

I see him then: a tall man with brown hair and tired blue eyes. He is not from Read Hall. It is Mr Webster, from the church at Kildwick. My legs stop moving and suddenly I want to sit down.

'Come on, come on,' the guard says angrily. He begins to close the door.

'Come out here for a minute, Jennet,' Mr Webster says quietly. 'Sit down and eat something.'

I sit down at a little table near the door. Mr Webster gives me some bread and some meat and I begin to eat hungrily.

'Ten minutes,' the guard says. 'After ten minutes, she goes in again.'

'Thank you,' Mr Webster says.

'How is everyone at Read Hall?' I ask at last.

Mr Webster smiles. 'Everyone is well. I was there yesterday.'

I close my eyes for a minute. 'Mr Webster, it's not true. I'm not a witch, you know.'

'I know, Jennet,' Mr Webster says. 'Last week, I brought Edmund Robinson and his father into my church, and asked them about the boy's story. Many people believed Edmund's story, but some people didn't. Edmund Robinson is going to London tomorrow with his father, and a judge is going to question them.'

The guard comes back and begins to open the door.

'Time!' he says.

Mr Webster stands up. 'God is here with you, Jennet. Never forget that. You can be happy, when God is with you.'

I stand up too, and take the bread from the table. 'Yes, Mr Webster. God is with me; I believe that.' But happy? How can I be happy?

I go back into the dark prison, and the guard closes the door behind me. The women run to me. 'Bread! Give us bread!' they cry.

Quickly, I put the bread in my shirt. I don't want to lose it. I walk across the room and sit down on the floor. I am crying, but I feel a little better. Edmund Robinson, of Newchurch, is only ten years old. Edmund told lies about me and about many women: he saw us at a witches' meeting at a house called Hoarstones. It's not true, but many people believed him. What is he going to say in London? The truth? Or more lies.

But now, in the prison of Lancaster Castle, I want to tell my story. It is a story about rich men and angry villagers; about old women and hungry children. It is a true story, and it happened to me.

I was born in 1603. My family was always very poor, and after my father died, we were poorer. In winter, I was often ill and I was always cold and hungry. In summer, I was sometimes ill and I was often cold and hungry. We lived some miles from the village of Newchurch, in an old house called Malkin Tower. It was dirty and cold. The rain came in through the windows and there were no doors. To the west, was the big hill called Pendle. Pendle Hill was beautiful. I loved Pendle Hill because it sat quietly all year and watched me.

My story begins on the eighteenth day of March in the year 1612. I was nine years old, and my life began to change on that day. My mother and my grandmother were ill and they sat on the floor, with their dogs, near the little fire.

My sister Alizon wanted to go out. 'I'm going to look for bread,' she said.

My brother James sat near the fire, his mouth open. 'Go and look for bread,' he said. 'Go and look for bread.' James often said things again and again.

Alizon ran out of the house and I followed her.

'Go and look for bread!' James called.

Alizon began to go east, up the hill and past the big trees behind Malkin Tower. Alizon walked fast. She was eighteen years old and she was tall with long, dirty brown hair and a white, hungry face. It was cold, but there was no rain. Alizon wore a coat and some shoes, but I had no coat and no shoes.

'Please wait a minute!' I called to my sister. 'I want to come with you.'

'No!' Alizon cried. 'Go back, I don't want you.'

Suddenly, a dog ran in front of Alizon.

'Good dog, good dog!' Alizon called. The dog ran to her and she put her hand on its head. It was my sister's dog and it liked her. It was a big dog with big teeth and I didn't like it because it was always hungry.

I followed Alizon and her dog along the river to Colne. But before we arrived at Colne, we met John Law. John Law was a big fat man, about fifty years old.

'Can I have some money, please?' Alizon called. 'I'm hungry.'

John Law didn't answer. He walked slowly because he was fat and because he carried a big bag on his back. In his bag were a lot of beautiful things. He was a pedlar and he walked across the hills and visited all the villages.

'Can I have some money?' Alizon called again. 'I'm very hungry!'

John Law stopped. 'Stop following me,' he said. 'I'm not going to give you money.'

'Give me money!' Alizon said.

'I don't want to give you money,' the pedlar said. He took his hat off. There was not much hair on his head. 'I don't like you and I don't like your family. A lot of bad women, you are, and your father was a bad man, too.'

Alizon was angry. 'Don't talk about my father—he's dead now! Give me some money, old man!'

John Law's face was red. 'No!' he cried. He began to walk up the hill to the village. 'Go back to your dirty family!'

Alizon began to laugh angrily. 'A dead man! A dead man!' she called. 'Dead before dark, John Law!' She looked down at her dog and put her hand on its head. 'Go after him, dog,' she said. 'Go after him and get him!'

The big dog began to run after the pedlar. John Law stopped. He looked afraid and his face was very red. 'Call your dog back, you bad girl!' he shouted.

Suddenly, his mouth opened and his face went white. Slowly, he began to fall, and his big body hit the road. The dog came up to him, but the pedlar did not move.

Alizon watched John Law for a minute. Then she said to me, 'Go and call someone from the village.'

I felt afraid, but I ran along the road very quickly. 'Help! Help!' I called to the villagers. 'The pedlar is ill!'

The villagers came out of their houses and followed me down the hill. A young man looked at John Law carefully.

'He's not dead,' he said, 'but he's very ill. Let's move him to the nearest house. Someone must go and call his son.'

Just then, John Law began to talk very slowly. 'I can't move!' he said. 'I'm alive, but I can't move!'

I went back to stand near Alizon. The dog sat at her feet.

'That Device girl...' John Law said slowly, 'she—she cursed me! She wanted me to die! And her dog came to get me.'

All the villagers looked at Alizon.

'I'm sorry,' Alizon said quickly. 'I'm very hungry and I wanted some money, that's all.'

'Go away!' the villagers cried. 'You're a witch, and we don't want you in our village.'

Alizon began to run away down the hill and her dog followed. I watched the villagers. They carried John Law slowly up the hill to the nearest house. And then I followed my sister down the hill. I was hungry and tired and Malkin Tower was many miles away. I was nine years old and I was angry. I was angry because the pedlar was ill. I was angry because the villagers didn't like me. And I was angry because my sister was a witch.

1 　小贩

1634年的春天来了，但是在兰开斯特城堡监狱里却是寒冷依旧。关在狱中的20个女犯人又脏、又饿、又冷。牢房里既没有床也没有椅子，她们就睡在冰冷的地上。由于没有窗户，房间里总是一片黑暗。女囚们想离开监狱；她们想回家。有时候看守打开破旧的大门，把面包和水放在地上，然后又将大门牢牢地关上。

我叫詹妮特·迪瓦斯，是20个女囚犯中的一员。日复一日，我坐在冰冷的地上等待着。我希望再次感受到温暖，我希望重新看到蔚蓝的天空和我家附近的美丽的潘德尔山。然而，我却是在黑暗的兰开斯特城堡监狱里，坐在冰冷的地上等待着。

有一天，发生了一件事。看守打开了破旧的大门。“詹妮特·迪瓦斯！”看守喊道。“快过来，女巫！有人要见你。”

因为太冷了，我缓慢地爬起来，穿过黑暗的房间向门口走去。也许是从里德宅院来的什么人！也许我要回家了！

“詹妮特·迪瓦斯，快点！”那个看守又喊道。

有一个人站在门边，和看守在一起。“詹妮特。”他轻轻地说了一声。

这时，我看清楚他了：他是一个长着棕色头发的高个子男人，一双蓝眼睛里带着倦意。他不是里德宅院的人，他是从基尔德威克的教堂来的韦伯斯特先生。我的两条腿停止了挪动，突然，我想坐下来。

“快点，快点。”看守生气地说。他开始关上大门。

“出来待会儿，詹妮特，”韦伯斯特先生平静地说。“坐下来吃点东西。”

我在靠门的一张小桌旁坐了下来。韦伯斯特先生给了我一些面包和肉，我大吃起来。

“10分钟，”看守说，“10分钟后她就得回去。”

“谢谢你。”韦伯斯特先生说。

“里德宅院的人们都好吗？”我终于开口问道。

韦伯斯特先生微笑着说：“大家都好。我昨天到那里去了。”

我闭上眼睛，过了一小会儿，我说：“韦伯斯特先生，这不是真的。你知道，我不是女巫。”

“我知道，詹妮特，”韦伯斯特先生说。“上个星期，我把埃德蒙·鲁滨逊和他的父亲带到我的教堂，向他们询问起了埃德蒙讲的故事。许多人相信埃德蒙的话，但是也有些人不相信。明天埃德蒙将和他的父亲一起去伦敦，在那里，法官会盘问他们的。”

那个看守回来了并打开了牢门。

“到时间了！”他说。

韦伯斯特先生站了起来。“上帝与你同在，詹妮特。别忘了这一点。当上帝陪伴着你时，你会快乐的。”

我也站起身来，把面包从桌上拿走。“是的，韦伯斯特先生。上帝与我同在；我相信。”可是，快乐？我怎么可能快乐呢？

我又回到了黑暗的牢房，看守在我身后关上了牢门。女囚犯们向我跑来：“面包！给我们面包！”她们大喊着。

我迅速地把面包放进衬衣里。我可不愿失去它。我穿过房间坐到了地上。我在哭泣，但是我感觉稍好一点了。纽丘奇村的埃德蒙·鲁滨逊只有10岁。他说了有关我和很多妇女的谎话：他说他看到我们在一所名叫霍尔斯通斯的房子里参加女巫会议。那不是真的，可是许多人相信他的话。在伦敦他会讲些什么呢？真话？也许是更多的谎言。

不过现在，在兰开斯特城堡监狱里，我想讲述我的故事。它是一个关于有钱人和愤怒的村民们；关于老年妇女和饥饿的儿童的故事。这是一个真实的故事，它就发生在我的身上。

我出生于1603年。我的家庭一直非常贫穷。自从我的父亲去世后，我们的日子更艰难了。一年到头，我吃不饱、穿不暖，还常常生病。我们住在一所名叫马尔金塔的老房子里，离纽丘奇村有几英里远。这所房子又脏又冷，连一扇门也没有。下雨时雨水便从窗户浇进来。我家西面有一座潘德尔大山。它很美丽。我爱这座山，因为它终年宁静地坐落在那里，注视着我。

我的故事从这里讲起，那是1612年3月18日。当时我9岁。就在那一天，我的生活开始发生了变化。那天，我的妈妈和外祖母都生着病，她们围着一小堆火，和她们的几条狗一起坐在地上。

我的姐姐艾丽森想到外面去。“我去找点面包。”她说。

我哥哥詹姆斯张着嘴靠火坐着。“去找面包，”他说，“去找面包。”詹姆斯经常不断地重复他的话。

艾丽森跑出房子，我在后面跟着她。

“去找面包！”詹姆斯喊道。

艾丽森向东走去。她爬上山，走过马尔金塔后面的棵棵大树。艾丽森走得很快。她那年18岁，个子高高的，棕色的长发脏乎乎的。她脸色苍白，饥肠辘辘。天气很冷，但是没有下雨。艾丽森穿着外衣和鞋子，而我既没有外衣也没有鞋子。

“请等一下！”我冲姐姐喊道，“我想和你一起去。”

“不！”艾丽森大声说，“回去，我不需要你。”

忽然间，一只狗在艾丽森面前跑着。

“乖狗儿，乖狗儿！”艾丽森招呼道。那条狗跑到她面前，艾丽森把手放在它的头上。它是我姐姐的狗，它喜欢她。它是条大狗，牙齿很大，可我不喜欢它，因为它总是显得饥饿不堪。

我跟着艾丽森和她的狗沿着河向科恩村走去。在路上，我们遇到了约翰·劳。他是个大胖子，50岁上下。

“您能给点钱吗？”艾丽森大声说，“我饿着呢。”

约翰·劳没有回答。他走得很慢，一来因为他胖，二来因为他背着一个大口袋，口袋里有许多好玩意儿。他是个小商贩，翻山越岭，跑遍了所有村庄。

“能给我点钱吗？”艾丽森又喊了一次，“我很饿！”

约翰·劳停住了。“别跟着我，”他说，“我不会给你钱的。”

“给我钱！”艾丽森说。

“我不想给你钱，”小贩说。他摘下帽子，他的头发已经很稀少了。“我不喜欢你，我不喜欢你们全家。你们都是些坏女人，你的爸爸也是个坏人。”

艾丽森生气了。“不许你提我父亲——他已经死了！给我钱，老头！”

约翰·劳的脸涨红了。“不！”他喊道。他开始上山往村里走去。“回到你那肮脏的家里去吧！”

艾丽森愤怒地大笑起来。“一个死人！一个死人！”她大喊着，“天黑前就死，约翰·劳！”她低下头看看她的狗，把手放在它的头上。“去追他，”她说，“去追他，抓住他。”

那条大狗奔跑着去追赶小贩。约翰·劳停下了脚步。他看上去很害怕，满脸通红。“把你的狗叫回去，你这个坏女孩！”他大声喊着。

突然，他的嘴张开了，脸色煞白。慢慢地，他倒了下去，他那硕大的身躯摔倒在路上。大狗冲到他身旁，而小贩却一动不动。

艾丽森盯着约翰·劳看了片刻，然后她对我说：“去村里叫人来。”

我很害怕，但还是沿着路快跑起来。“救人呐！救人呐！”我向村民们大喊，“小贩生病了！”

村民们从各自家里出来，跟着我下了山。一个年轻人仔细地看了看约翰·劳。

“他没有死，”他说。“可是他病得很重。咱们把他抬到最近的房子里去吧。必须把他的儿子叫来。”

就在那时，约翰·劳十分缓慢地说道：“我动不了。”他说：“我还活着，可我动不了。”

我回到艾丽森身旁站着。大狗蹲在她的脚边。

“那个迪瓦斯家的女孩子……”约翰·劳慢吞吞地说，“她——她诅咒我！她想让我死！她的狗向我扑过来。”

村民们都看着艾丽森。

“我很抱歉。”艾丽森急忙说，“我很饿，我想要点钱，就是这么回事。”

“快走开！”村民们喊道，“你是个女巫，我们不想让你待在我们村里。”

艾丽森向山下跑去，她的狗紧跟着她。我看着村民们。他们抬着约翰·劳缓慢地上山，向最近的一所房子走去。随后我跟着我的姐姐下了山。我又饿又乏，而马尔金塔远在数英里之外。那时我9岁，我很生气。我生气，因为小贩病了。我生气，因为村民们不喜欢我。我生气，因为我的姐姐是个女巫。

2ROGER NOWELL

ROGER NOWELL

John Law was ill because Alizon cursed him, and his son wanted Roger Nowell to question Alizon. Roger Nowell was a rich and important man in Lancashire, and he was the judge for all the villages near Pendle Hill. He lived at Read Hall, seven miles from Newchurch.

On the thirtieth day of March, Mr Nowell's men came to Malkin Tower. Mr Nowell wanted to see Alizon at once.

We walked from Malkin Tower to Read Hall: my sister Alizon, my brother James, and our mother, Elizabeth Device. I followed them because I didn't want to stay at home with my grandmother. My grandmother was a difficult old woman, and I didn't like her.

Read Hall was an old house with a big garden and many old trees. Mr Nowell's servant opened the door for us.

'Come in,' Mr Nowell said. He was a tall man with a lot of white hair. His black coat looked warm and expensive.

Alizon followed Mr Nowell into a room with a big fire. When I saw the fire, I wanted to go in, too!

'Are you cold, little one?' Mr Nowell asked me. 'Come in, and sit near the fire.'

I went across the room and sat down on the floor, next to the wonderful, hot fire.

Mr Nowell sat behind a big table. Two or three men, in black coats, stood near the window. Alizon stood in front of Mr Nowell. Her long hair was dirty, and her old dress looked dirtier.

'Two weeks ago, on the eighteenth day of March, you met John Law near Colne,' Roger Nowell said. His voice was slow and careful. 'Tell me about it.'

'I asked for money,' Alizon said. 'The pedlar was very angry and I didn't like him. I was angry, too, and I wanted him to die!'

'Tell me about your dog.'

'The dog is my friend.' Alizon said slowly. 'I wanted a friend, and I found that dog two months ago. I told my grandmother, and she liked the dog, too.'

'Did the dog run after the pedlar?'

'Yes, of course. I cursed the pedlar, and the dog ran after him!' Alizon said. 'I'm sorry now, because Mr Law is ill.'

'She's a witch!' one of the men said quietly.

Roger Nowell stood up and walked across the room to the door. 'James Device, come in. We want to question you.'

James came in and stood next to Alizon. James was thirteen years old, nearly a man, but he was afraid of many things. He began to cry.

'Don't be afraid,' Mr Nowell said. 'We want you to talk about your grandmother, Old Demdike.'

But Alizon wanted to talk. 'Don't ask him!' she said quickly. 'I can tell you about my grandmother because I'm with her every minute of the day. I go with her from village to village. I go with her across Pendle Hill. She asks people for money and food, and I help her.' Alizon stopped. She looked at James, and then she looked at Mr Nowell. 'She cursed a child once, and the child died later that year.'

'And you!' James said. 'You cursed a child, too! Somebody told me!' James suddenly sat down on the floor and began to laugh loudly.

'Be quiet!' Roger Nowell said coldly. 'Alizon Device, tell me the truth: did you curse a child?'

'Yes, I did,' Alizon cried. 'The child called me a witch, and I was angry. I cursed the child, but I was sorry when the child died.'

James looked up at Alizon, his mouth open. 'The child died, the child died,' he said again and again.

'Alizon Device, you cannot go home again,' Roger Nowell said slowly. 'You must go to the prison at Read.'

'But I need Alizon!' my mother shouted angrily from the door. 'She takes care of Old Demdike, my mother.'

I looked at my mother, at her red, angry face. I looked at Alizon in her dirty dress, and at James on the floor with his mouth open. And then I looked at Mr Nowell: his brown eyes were warm, and his face was kind.

On the second day of April, Roger Nowell and his men came to Ashlar House, near the village of Fence. Mr Nowell wanted to talk to my grandmother, and we all went with her to Ashlar House. Fence was not far from Malkin Tower, and my grandmother walked there easily.

Old Demdike was a little old woman with a fat face and no teeth. She was nearly eighty years old and she was a difficult old woman. Without Alizon, she was more difficult because my mother didn't take care of her.

When I saw Mr Nowell again at Ashlar House, I felt happy. I looked at his kind face and his warm brown eyes, and I wanted to be near him. But there were a lot of people in the room, and I was afraid to go to him.

'Old Demdike, I'm going to ask you some questions,' Mr Nowell began.

Old Demdike was not afraid. She looked at all the men, in their expensive coats and hats. 'What can a poor old woman tell you rich men?' She laughed, and when she laughed I felt afraid. My grandmother was going to tell them everything!

And she did!

'Twenty years ago, I met the Devil,' Old Demdike said. 'He was a boy called Tibb and he was my friend. Then a cat came to visit me—a beautiful cat—and then a dog. They were all my friends.'

Mr Nowell listened quietly to my grandmother, but some of the men began to talk angrily.

'Be careful, you rich men!' my grandmother cried. 'I can curse you! I can kill people! I make clay pictures of people — man, woman or child. And when I break the clay, that man, woman or child dies!'

People began to shout.

'She's a witch! She must die!'

'Say no more; she must die, with all her family!'

Roger Nowell stood up. 'Be quiet!' He looked at the guards near the door. 'Take her away,' he said. 'Old Demdike and her granddaughter Alizon must go to the prison at Lancaster Castle.'

The guards took my grandmother by the arms and carried her out of the door and put her on a horse. Everyone ran out of Ashlar House. They ran after the horses and shouted: 'Kill the witch!'

I looked for Mr Nowell, but he was on his horse, too, and he followed the guards quickly through the village.

Slowly, I followed my mother and James. Malkin Tower was my home, but I didn't want to go back there. I was a little child, and I wanted someone kind to take care of me.

We stayed at home for days, because we were afraid to go out. James sat in front of the fire, with his dog, and talked. 'Lancaster Castle, Lancaster Castle, ' he said, again and again. My mother hit me and shouted at me because she was angry with the rich men.

But after three days, my mother suddenly said, 'James! We're hungry and we must eat!'

James didn't answer.

My mother went across the room to James and pulled his hair. 'Get up!' she shouted. 'Go out and find food for us! Your father isn't here now; you must find food for us.' She hit him over the head.

James stood up slowly. 'Go out and find food,' he said. 'I must go out and find food.'

It was dark, and James was out for hours. But in the morning, he came back with a sheep.

'I went to Barley,' James said happily. 'I got this sheep, and now we can eat.'

'Get up, Jennet!' my mother shouted. 'Come and help me!'

It was Friday, the tenth day of April. My family had some friends, poor people, and on that day they came to Malkin Tower. They came and asked about Old Demdike and Alizon, and they stayed to eat and drink.

I helped my mother. We cooked the sheep over a big fire, and our visitors ate with us. At the same time, they drank. They sat by the fire and drank, and talked about Lancaster Castle.

'Let's go there!' an old woman cried. 'Let's go to Lancaster Castle and find Old Demdike and Alizon!'

'We can curse the guards, and break down the door!' my mother said.

'Let's bring them home!' said an old man.

'Jennet, bring the bottle! We need more drink!' shouted my mother.

I got up and took more drink to my mother. But I fell over one of the dogs, and the bottle broke on the floor. The drink was gone!

'You bad child!' my mother shouted. 'You're a witch, too, you know!' She got up and began to hit me. She hit me over the head and pulled my hair. An old man laughed, and then everyone laughed.

I ran back across the room. I wasn't a witch; I was a child, nine years old, and I hated my mother and all her friends! My face felt very hot because I was angry. I left the room and went out of the house. It was afternoon, but the sky was dark with rain. Pendle Hill was dark, too. It sat quietly and watched me.

'I'm going to Mr Nowell,' I said quietly, to Pendle Hill. 'I'm going to tell him about my mother and her friends.'

2 　罗杰·诺埃尔

由于艾丽森的诅咒，约翰·劳病倒了。他的儿子希望罗杰·诺埃尔审问艾丽森。罗杰·诺埃尔是兰开夏郡一个有钱有势的人，他是潘德尔山一带所有村落的法官。他住在里德宅院，离纽丘奇村7英里远。

3月30日那天，诺埃尔先生手下的人来到了马尔金塔，因为诺埃尔先生想马上见一见艾丽森。

我们一行离开了马尔金塔步行前往里德宅院：我的姐姐艾丽森，我的哥哥詹姆斯，还有我的母亲伊丽莎白·迪瓦斯。我之所以与他们同行是因为我不想和外祖母一起留在家里。我的外祖母是一个很难相处的老太婆，我不喜欢她。

里德宅院是一所老房子，里面有一个大花园和许多古树。诺埃尔先生的用人为我们打开了房门。

“进来。”诺埃尔先生说。他个子很高，白发苍苍。他的黑色大衣看起来既暖和又昂贵。

艾丽森跟着诺埃尔先生走进了一个房间，那里面生着旺旺的炉火。当我看到炉火时，真希望自己也能跟着进去！

“你冷吧，小家伙？”诺埃尔先生问我。“进来，坐到炉火旁边去。”

我穿过房间，坐到地板上，紧靠着那美妙的、暖烘烘的炉火。

诺埃尔先生在一张大桌子后面坐下。有两三个穿着黑大衣的男人靠近窗口站着。艾丽森站在诺埃尔先生面前，她的长发脏兮兮的，身上的旧裙子比头发还要脏。

“两个星期前，也就是3月18日那天，你在科恩村附近遇到了约翰·劳，”罗杰·诺埃尔说。他的声音低沉而谨慎。“给我讲讲这件事。”

“我向他要钱，”艾丽森说，“小贩很生气，我不喜欢他。我也很生气，我希望他死！”

“给我讲讲你的狗是怎么回事。”

“它是我的朋友，”艾丽森慢慢地说道，“我想要一个朋友，两个月前我找到了那条狗。我把这件事告诉了我的外祖母，她也喜欢那条狗。”

“那条狗是不是追赶小贩了？”

“当然追了。我诅咒了小贩，那条狗便去追赶他！”艾丽森说，“现在劳先生病了，我很抱歉。”

“她是个女巫！”一个男人轻声说。

罗杰·诺埃尔站了起来，穿过房间走到门口。“詹姆斯·迪瓦斯，进来。我们有话问你。”

詹姆斯走了进来，站在艾丽森身边。詹姆斯13岁，几乎是个男子汉了，但是，他对很多东西都感到恐惧。他哭了起来。

“别害怕，”诺埃尔先生说，“我们想让你讲讲你的外祖母老德姆代克的一些事。”

可是，这时候艾丽森却想说话。“别问他！”她急促地说，“我可以告诉你们关于我外祖母的事，因为我一天到晚和她在一起。我们俩一起翻越潘德尔山，走了一村又一村。她向人们讨饭要钱，我给她帮忙。”艾丽森停住了。她看了看詹姆斯，又看了看诺埃尔先生，接着说：“她曾经诅咒过一个小孩儿，后来，就在那一年，小孩儿死了。”

“还有你！”詹姆斯说，“你也诅咒过一个小孩儿！有人告诉我了！”詹姆斯突然坐到了地板上，大笑起来。

“安静！”罗杰·诺埃尔冷冷地说。“艾丽森·迪瓦斯，对我说真话：你曾诅咒过一个小孩儿吗？”

“是的，诅咒过，”艾丽森喊道，“那个孩子管我叫女巫，我生气了。我就诅咒了他，但是对于他的死我很抱歉。”

詹姆斯抬起头，张着嘴看着艾丽森。“那个孩子死了，那个孩子死了。”他一遍遍地说着。

“艾丽森·迪瓦斯，你不能再回家了。”罗杰·诺埃尔缓慢地说道，“我们必须把你送进里德监狱。”

“可是我需要艾丽森！”我的妈妈在门边气愤地喊着，“是她照顾我的母亲老德姆代克。”

我看了看我的妈妈，她的脸涨得通红，脸上带着愤怒的表情。我又看了看穿着脏裙子的艾丽森，还有张着嘴坐在地上的詹姆斯。然后我看了一眼诺埃尔先生：他的棕色眼睛流露出热情，他的面容是和善的。

4月2日，罗杰·诺埃尔和他的随从人员来到了芬斯村附近的艾什拉屋。诺埃尔先生想和我的外祖母谈谈，于是我们全家和她一起去了艾什拉屋。芬斯村离马尔金塔不远，我的外祖母并没有费多少劲就走到了那里。

老德姆代克是个身材矮小的老太婆，她长着一张胖胖的脸，牙齿全掉光了。她快八十岁了，很难相处。艾丽森不在她更使性子，因为我的妈妈根本不照顾她。

当我在艾什拉屋再次看到诺埃尔先生时，我感到很高兴。看着他和善的面孔和充满热情的棕色眼睛，我很想靠他近一些。可是房间里人很多，我不敢过去。

“老德姆代克，我要问你一些问题。”诺埃尔先生说。

老德姆代克并不害怕。她看了看所有衣帽华贵的男人。“一个穷老太婆能告诉你们有钱人什么呢？”她哈哈大笑着说。她的笑声令我恐惧。我的外祖母就要把一切都告诉他们了！

她真的说了！

“20年前，我遇到了魔鬼，”老德姆代克说，“他是一个名叫蒂勃的男孩，他是我的朋友。后来有一只猫来拜访我——一只美丽的猫——随后又来了一条狗。他们都是我的朋友。”

诺埃尔先生安静地听着，但是有些男人生气地交谈起来。

“小心点，你们这些有钱人！”我的外祖母喊道，“我能诅咒你们！我能让人丧命！我用泥制成人像——男人的，女人的或是小孩的，当我打碎人像时，那个男人、女人或小孩就会死去。”

人们开始大喊起来。

“她是个女巫！一定得要她的命！”

“不要再说什么了，她必须死，和她的全家一起死！”

罗杰·诺埃尔站了起来。“安静！”他看了看守在门口的警卫。“把她带走。”他说，“必须把老德姆代克和她的外孙女艾丽森关进兰开斯特城堡监狱。”

卫兵们抓住我外祖母的胳膊，把她带出门，放到一匹马上。大家全都跑出了艾什拉屋。他们追赶着马队，高喊：“杀死女巫！”

我寻找着诺埃尔先生，可是他也上了马，跟在卫兵们后面迅速地穿过村子走了。

我跟在妈妈和詹姆斯后面慢慢地走着。马尔金塔是我的家，但是我并不想回去。我还是个孩子，我希望有个慈爱的人来关心我。

因为不敢出门，我们在家里待了好些天。詹姆斯和他的狗坐在火堆前，嘴里念叨着：“兰开斯特城堡，兰开斯特城堡。”他一遍又一遍地说着。我妈妈打我，冲我大嚷大叫，因为那些有钱人很让她恼火。

3天后，妈妈突然说：“詹姆斯！我们饿了，咱们得吃东西呀！”

詹姆斯没有答话。

妈妈穿过房间走到詹姆斯跟前，揪着他的头发。“起来！”她大喊着，“出去给我们找点吃的！你爸爸现在不在了，你必须给我们找吃找喝。”她打了一下他的头。

詹姆斯慢慢腾腾地站起来。“出去找吃的，”他说，“我必须出去找吃的。”

天黑了，詹姆斯已经出去好几个小时了。第二天早上，他带着一只羊回来了。

“我到巴利村去了。”詹姆斯高兴地说，“我找到了这只羊，现在我们可以吃饭了。”

“起来，詹妮特！”我妈妈喊道，“来给我帮忙！”

我们家有一些朋友，都是穷人。4月10日星期五那天，他们来到了马尔金塔。他们来询问老德姆代克和艾丽森的情况，然后留下来又吃又喝。

我帮助妈妈干活。我们在一个大火堆上烤羊，客人们和我们一起吃饭。他们还喝起酒来。他们围坐在火堆旁一边喝酒，一边谈论着兰开斯特城堡。

“咱们到那儿去吧！”一个老太太大声说，“咱们去兰开斯特城堡救出老德姆代克和艾丽森！”

“我们可以咒死看守，然后把门打破！”我妈妈说。

“咱们把她俩带回家来！”一个老头儿说。

“詹妮特，把酒瓶拿来！我们得再喝点！”妈妈喊道。

我站起来去给妈妈再拿些酒。可是我绊倒在一只狗身上，酒瓶掉在地上摔碎了，酒洒了！

“你这个坏孩子！”我妈妈嚷道，“你也是个女巫，你清楚！”她站起来打我。她打我的头，揪我的头发。一个老头哈哈大笑，大家也都跟着哄笑起来。

我穿过房间跑了回去。我不是女巫；我是个9岁的孩子。我恨妈妈和她所有的朋友！由于愤怒我的脸很烫。我离开房间，走出了这所房子。当时是下午，但是由于下着雨，天很黑。潘德尔山也是一片漆黑。它静静地坐落在那里，注视着我。

“我要去找诺埃尔先生，”我平静地对潘德尔山说，“我要告诉他有关我妈妈和她的朋友们的事情。”

3A FAMILY OF WITCHES

A FAMILY OF WITCHES

I ran from Malkin Tower, down the hill into Newchurch. James followed me.

'I want to go to Read Hall, too,' he said.

We ran through the trees to Sabden Brook. The noise of the river was beautiful in my ears. We went along the river to the village of Sabden, and then it began to rain.

Suddenly, we heard the noise of horses behind us. We got off the road, and watched the horses. It was Roger Nowell with some of his men. They saw us, and Mr Nowell stopped.

'It's the Device children,' he said. 'What's your name, child?'

'My name is Jennet,' I said. 'We're going to Read Hall. I want to talk to you.'

Roger Nowell looked at me with his warm brown eyes. 'Very well,' he said. 'Come home with me, and we can talk.' He lifted me up on to his horse, and the horse moved quickly along the road to the village of Read. James ran along behind us.

Very soon, we arrived at Read Hall. The servant opened the door for us, and we went into the warm house. James came in, too, and sat down next to me near the fire.

Mr Nowell put his black hat down on the table. 'Bring a hot drink and some food for these children,' he told the servant. 'They're cold and hungry.'

The servant brought bread and hot milk for us, and James and I ate hungrily. I felt warm and happy in Mr Nowell's house. I wanted to stay there all my life; I never wanted to go back to Malkin Tower.

When we finished eating, Mr Nowell looked up from his book. 'You wanted to talk to me,' he said quietly. 'Well, I'm listening.'

I got up, went across the room and stood in front of Mr Nowell. 'I'm afraid of my mother,' I began. 'I'm afraid because she's a witch and she can kill people.'

The room was quiet. Mr Nowell said nothing, but his brown eyes were kind.

'My mother and her friends are at Malkin Tower,' I told him. 'They want to go to Lancaster Castle and kill the guards. They're going to bring Old Demdike and Alizon home again.'

Mr Nowell got up and left the room. After some time, he came back with two of his friends. They all sat down at the table.

'Jennet, I want you to tell me again about your mother and her friends.'

'They want to kill the guards at Lancaster Castle and bring Old Demdike home to Malkin Tower,' I said. Then I began to cry.

'Don't cry,' Mr Nowell said kindly. 'We can help you, but we must talk to your brother first. James!' he called. 'Tell me about your mother. Is she a witch?'

'She's a witch. We're all witches,' James began. 'Old Demdike's a witch. One night, she went to the church at Newchurch and got some teeth from dead bodies there. The Devil talked to her and she brought the teeth to Malkin Tower. They're under the ground by our door!'

'Old Demdike's a witch; we know that,' Mr Nowell said. 'Tell us about your mother.'

'Mother's a witch,' James said. 'She killed Mr Robinson, from Barley village. She made a clay picture, and then she broke it, and Mr Robinson died a week later.' James smiled at Mr Nowell. He liked Mr Nowell because Mr Nowell didn't shout at him. 'And I'm a witch, too! I can kill people!'

'No, James!' I cried. 'You're not a witch! You don't kill people!'

'Yes, I do,' James said angrily. His face went red. 'My dog, Dandy, is the Devil and he killed a man for me. I wanted a shirt and Mr Duckworth was going to give me one of his old shirts. But in the end, he didn't give it to me and I was very angry. I nearly killed Mr Duckworth! But I called Dandy, and he killed Mr Duckworth for me!'

I began to cry. My brother was a witch, too! All my family were witches!

'Don't cry, Jennet,' Mr Nowell said. 'Someone must take care of you. You can stay here at Read Hall with me.'

When Mr Nowell's men brought my mother to Read Hall, she said nothing at first.

'Tell us about the pictures of clay,' Mr Nowell said. 'My men found pictures of clay at Malkin Tower.'

My mother said nothing.

'Your mother, Old Demdike, is a witch. Your daughter is a witch,' Mr Nowell said. 'Your son killed Mr Duckworth because of a shirt. Now, tell us about the clay pictures.'

My mother said nothing.

'James told us about Mr Robinson of Barley,' Mr Nowell said. 'Did you kill him?'

Suddenly, my mother's face went red and she began to shout at James. 'A good son, you are! You told this rich man about Jack Robinson of Barley. Well, you told the truth. I killed him! I made a clay picture, and then I broke it, and a week later he died. I killed him because I hated him.'

She stopped and looked at me. I wanted to run away but Mr Nowell's servant stood in front of the door. Then my mother laughed. 'Jennet Device, witch's daughter! You hate us, I know that. Well, it doesn't matter because you're right: you are different. You're my daughter, but you're not the daughter of my husband. Your father was a rich man, but he never gave me money. A witch's child, he called you. And when you were born, he never came near me again. Jack Robinson learnt the truth about your father. He told the villagers of Barley and they called me a bad woman, but they didn't call your father a bad man! Nobody in Barley gave me food again, because of Jack Robinson. I hated him, and so I killed him!'

The room was very quiet and my mother laughed again.

My hands felt cold and my face was hot, but I didn't cry. When Mr Device died, I cried for days. But he was not my father. I looked at my mother, at her dirty hair and her ugly face, at her angry eyes. I hated her then, and I hated her for many years.

3 　巫师之家

我跑出马尔金塔，跑下潘德尔山来到了纽丘奇村。詹姆斯一直跟着我。

“我也想去里德宅院。”他说。

我们穿过树林来到了萨卜登小溪。潺潺的流水声在我听来十分悦耳。我们沿着河走到了萨卜登村，这时天下起雨来。

忽然，从我们身后传来了马蹄声。我们离开大路，看着那些马匹。那是罗杰·诺埃尔和他的手下。他们看到了我们俩，诺埃尔先生停了下来。

“原来是迪瓦斯家的孩子们，”他说，“孩子，你叫什么名字？”

“我叫詹妮特，”我说，“我们要去里德宅院。我想和您谈谈。”

罗杰·诺埃尔用他那双充满热情的棕色眼睛看了看我。“很好，”他说，“跟我一起回家吧，这样我们就可以谈谈了。”他把我举起来放到他的马上，马于是迅速地沿着大道向里德村行进。詹姆斯一路跑着跟在我们后面。

很快，我们到达了里德宅院。用人打开屋门，我们走进了十分暖和的房子。詹姆斯也进来了，他挨着我坐在炉火边。

诺埃尔先生把他的黑帽子放在桌子上。“给孩子们拿点热饮和一些吃的来。”他吩咐用人说，“他们又冷又饿。”

用人给我们拿来了面包和热牛奶，詹姆斯和我大吃起来。在诺埃尔先生家里，我感到既温暖又快乐。我希望一辈子待在那儿；我再也不想回到马尔金塔去了。

我们吃完了饭，诺埃尔先生不再看书，抬起头来。“你有事想对我说，”他轻声说，“好吧，我听着呢。”

我站起身，穿过房间，站在诺埃尔先生面前。“我害怕我妈妈，”我开始说道，“我害怕，因为她是女巫，她能杀人。”

房间里十分安静。诺埃尔先生什么也没说，但是他的棕色眼睛是友善的。

“现在，我妈妈和她的朋友们正聚在马尔金塔，”我告诉他说，“他们想要去兰开斯特城堡杀死看守。他们打算把老德姆代克和艾丽森带回家。”

诺埃尔先生站起身离开了房间。过了一些时候，他和他的两个朋友一起回来了。他们全都在桌前坐了下来。

“詹妮特，我要你再对我说一遍有关你母亲和她朋友的事。”

“他们想杀死兰开斯特城堡的看守，然后把老德姆代克带回马尔金塔。”我说。说完，我哭了。

“别哭，”诺埃尔先生和蔼地说，“我们能帮助你，不过我们必须先和你哥哥谈谈。詹姆斯！”他喊了一声。“给我讲讲你母亲的事。她是女巫吗？”

“她是女巫。我们都是巫师。”詹姆斯说，“老德姆代克是个女巫。一天夜里，她去了纽丘奇村的教堂，从那里的尸体上取下了一些牙齿。魔鬼和她对了话，随后她把牙齿带回了马尔金塔，它们就在我家大门旁的地下。”

“老德姆代克是个女巫，这我们知道，”诺埃尔先生说，“把你母亲的事告诉我们。”

“妈妈是女巫，”詹姆斯说，“她杀死了巴利村的鲁滨逊先生。她做了一个泥像，然后把它打碎，一星期后鲁滨逊先生死去了。”詹姆斯对诺埃尔先生微笑了一下。他喜欢诺埃尔先生，因为诺埃尔先生不冲着他大喊大叫。“还有，我也是个巫师！我能害死人！”

“不，詹姆斯！”我喊道，“你不是巫师！你不杀人！”

“不，我杀人。”詹姆斯生气地说。他的脸红了起来。“我的狗丹迪是魔鬼，它为我杀过一个人。有一次我想要一件衬衣，达克沃思先生准备把他的一件旧衬衣给我。可是最后他没有给我，我非常生气。我差点儿杀了他！不过我喊来了丹迪，它为我杀死了达克沃思先生！”

我哭了起来。我的哥哥也是个巫师！我的全家都是巫师！

“别哭，詹妮特，”诺埃尔先生说，“必须有人照顾你。你可以留在里德宅院，和我在一起。”

诺埃尔先生手下的人把我妈妈带到了里德宅院，起初她一言不发。

“把泥塑像的事告诉我们，”诺埃尔先生说，“我手下的人在马尔金塔找到了一些泥塑像。”

我妈妈没有作声。

“你的母亲老德姆代克是女巫。你的女儿是女巫，”诺埃尔先生说，“你的儿子为了一件衬衣杀死了达克沃思先生。现在把泥塑像的事告诉我们。”

我妈妈什么也没说。

“詹姆斯对我们讲了巴利村鲁滨逊先生的事，”诺埃尔先生说，“是你杀了他吗？”

突然间，我妈妈的脸涨红了，她冲着詹姆斯大喊：“你真是个好儿子！你把巴利村杰克·鲁滨逊的事告诉了这个有钱人。是的，你说的完全属实。是我杀了他！我做了一个泥像，然后把它打碎，一星期后他就死了。我杀了他是因为我恨他。”

她停下来看着我。我想跑开，可是诺埃尔先生的用人正站在门前。妈妈哈哈大笑着说：“詹妮特·迪瓦斯，巫师的女儿！我知道，你恨我们。嗯，这没什么，因为你是对的：你是 不一样。你是我女儿，但你不是我丈夫的女儿。你的父亲是个有钱人，可他从来不给我钱。他管你叫巫师的孩子。从你一出生，他就再也没靠近过我。杰克·鲁滨逊得知你亲生父亲的真相后，便告诉了巴利村的居民们。他们说我是坏女人，却不说你父亲是一个坏男人！从那以后，在巴利村，再也没有人给我吃的了，这都是杰克·鲁滨逊造成的。我恨他，所以我杀了他！”

房间里静悄悄的，我的妈妈又大笑起来。

我的手冰凉冰凉，我的脸热辣辣。不过我没有哭。迪瓦斯先生去世时，我哭了好几天。然而他不是我父亲。我看着妈妈，看着她那肮脏的头发、丑陋的面容和愤怒的双眼。在那一刻，我真恨她，许多年来我一直恨她。

4TRUTH AND LIES

TRUTH AND LIES

On the twenty-seventh day of April, the guards took my mother and James to Lancaster Castle, and my life at Read Hall began. Suddenly, it was spring. The sky was blue and there were beautiful flowers on the hills. From Read Hall, Pendle Hill looked different: it looked smaller, and it was not so important in my life. Sometimes I walked along Sabden Brook to Sabden, and then to Newchurch, and I felt happy to be near Pendle Hill again. But I never visited Malkin Tower again.

Spring changed into summer, and in August I went to Lancaster with Mr Nowell. Lancaster was thirty miles from Read Hall, and I got very tired because I sat on a horse for hours. It was a big, noisy town. I never saw so many people before in my life and I felt afraid.

The trial of the witches of Pendle began at Lancaster Castle on the eighteenth day of August, and the judge was an important man from London. Judge Bromley listened to many people on that day, because there were a lot of witches from Lancashire in the prison. Old Demdike was not there because she died in May, before the judge arrived.

I waited with Mr Nowell's servant, and when a guard called my name, I went through a big door and saw the judge behind a table. Judge Bromley was rich and important, but his eyes were cold. Suddenly, I saw my mother! She was dirty and very thin. When she saw me, her face went red. My hair was clean now, and I wore shoes and an expensive dress. I saw my mother's eyes: she hated me!

'Are you a witch?' Judge Bromley asked my mother.

'No, I'm not,' my mother answered angrily.

'Did you kill Jack Robinson, of Barley village?'

'No, I did not.'

'Jennet Device is here,' a voice said quietly. It was Mr Nowell. 'She can tell us the truth about her mother.'

For a minute, my mother did not move. Then she ran across the room and shouted at me. 'You know nothing, you bad child! And I'm your mother! Don't forget that!'

The guards ran after my mother and pulled her to the floor.

'I'm no witch!' my mother shouted. 'It's all lies! Jennet, you're a witch—a child of the Devil! You're my daughter, and I know !'

I was afraid and I put my hands over my eyes. I didn't want to see my mother's ugly face. The guards pulled my mother out of the room and the noise stopped.

'Jennet Device,' the judge said. 'Tell us the truth about your mother.'

Roger Nowell lifted me up and put me on a table in front of the judge.

'My mother is a witch,' I began. 'She has a friend, a dog called Ball. When she wants to kill somebody, she tells Ball...' I talked and talked; I told the judge everything.

Judge Bromley listened carefully. 'My child, is this the truth?'

'Yes,' I answered. 'I'm telling you the truth.'

The guards brought my mother back into the room again. Her face looked tired and her eyes were red.

'Elizabeth Device, your daughter told us about your dog, Ball. Your son, too, told us about the clay pictures. We know everything.'

My mother said nothing. She didn't look at the judge and she didn't look at me.

Next, the guards brought my brother James into the room. When I saw James, I wanted to cry. James was thin and dirty and his hair was very long. He looked at the judge and at all the rich and important men in the room and he began to cry. Then he sat down on the floor.

'Stand up, James Device,' Judge Bromley said.

The guards pulled James up, but he fell to the floor again.

'You killed Mr Duckworth,' Judge Bromley said.

'I wanted a shirt,' James cried.

'Is your brother a witch?' Judge Bromley asked me.

'Yes,' I said. My brother sat on the floor, his mouth open. He looked at me, but he didn't know me. I was clean, and fat because of all the good food at Read Hall.

'James told me about his friend, Dandy,' I began. 'Dandy was the Devil and—'

James heard the name Dandy, and he began to cry again. 'I want Dandy! I want to go home!'

The guards pulled him up from the floor and took him out of the room. I never saw my brother again.

When the guards brought my sister Alizon in front of the judge, I said nothing. John Law, the pedlar, came into the room. He was a thin man now. He walked slowly and he talked slowly and his face looked ill. He told the judge about that day near Colne when Alizon cursed him and her dog ran after him.

'I'm sorry!' Alizon said. 'I was angry with you that day, but I'm sorry now.' Alizon's eyes were dark and afraid, but she had no friends in that room and nobody wanted to listen to her.

Then Mr Nowell took me out and I waited with his servant in a different room. An hour later, there was the noise of many people shouting and crying.

The servant smiled. 'The trial is finished,' he said. 'You're a good child, Jennet. You told the judge the truth about the witches.'

Mr Nowell took me home to Read Hall. And on the twentieth day of August 1612, the guards took my mother, my sister and my brother out of prison, and hanged them in front of Lancaster Castle.

And so I lost my family.

When I was a child, I wanted to be happy. I wanted to be warm, to wear shoes, to eat good food. I wanted someone to take care of me. That's all. My mother gave me nothing. She gave me no love. She never took care of me. Because my mother was a witch, my father ran away and I never knew him. My father was a rich man without a name, and I lived hungry and cold with a witch. And so I told Judge Bromley the truth about my family. Was I wrong? I don't know.

I was happy for years at Read Hall. For twenty-one years, I forgot my family. I learned to cook for the Nowell family; I worked many hours every day but I was warm and I ate good food. Every Sunday, in my best dress, I went to church; every summer I walked over Pendle Hill. I never thought about my family, because I was happy at Read Hall.

In August 1612, the guards hanged my family in front of Lancaster Castle. But their dead faces waited for me there; and a year ago, in 1633, when the guards put me in the prison in Lancaster Castle, I met them again. Day after day, I see their ugly, dead faces and hear their cold, angry voices. I think of them all the time. God is with me here, in prison. I believe that. But my dead family is with me too.

Mr Webster, from the church at Kildwick, visits me again. His blue eyes are tired, but he smiles at me.

'Edmund Robinson and his father told the truth in London,' he says quietly. 'The child told lies about you because he was afraid of his father. He wanted his father to love him.'

I say nothing. Mr Webster wants to be kind, but he cannot help me. Mr Nowell cannot help me because he is dead. Edmund Robinson is only a child; he tells lies one day, and the truth the next day. But the truth cannot help me. What can I do against hate, and lies? When Mr Nowell was alive, the villagers didn't talk about me. But when Mr Nowell died, the lies began. The villagers are all afraid of me—because my name is Device. They hate me—because my name is Device. They say I am a witch—because my name is Device.

I come from a family of witches, but I am not a witch. Nobody died because I cursed them. I never made clay pictures, I never had a cat or dog. I only wanted to live quietly at Read Hall and watch the changing skies over Pendle Hill.

When I was a child, I was always cold and hungry, and I hated my family because they were witches. In 1612, I told the truth, and the truth killed my family. Now, twenty-two years later, lies are going to kill me, here in Lancaster Castle, and I am cold and hungry again.

Mr Webster gives me bread, and I go back into the prison. I can never go back to Read Hall; I know that now. I must stay here in Lancaster Castle, with my dead family.

They are watching me, and waiting for me. I can never be free of them.

This is my true story; and I want to finish it now.

4 　真相与谎言

4月27日，看守们把我妈妈和詹姆斯带到了兰开斯特城堡，我在里德宅院开始了新的生活。转眼间，春天来了。天空一片湛蓝，山上开着美丽的花朵。从里德宅院看去，潘德尔山显得和过去有些不同：它看起来小了点，而且它在我的生活中不再那么重要了。有时我沿着萨卜登小溪走到萨卜登村，然后再到纽丘奇村；我真高兴能再次靠近潘德尔山。但是我再也没有去过马尔金塔。

春去夏来，8月份我和诺埃尔先生一起去了兰开斯特。兰开斯特离里德宅院有30英里远，因为一连几小时坐在马背上，我很疲惫。兰开斯特是一个大而喧闹的市镇。我以前从来没有见过那么多的人，所以有点害怕。

8月18日，在兰开斯特城堡开始了对潘德尔地区的巫师的审判。法官是一位从伦敦来的重要人物。由于监狱里关着许多兰开夏郡的巫师，布罗姆利法官在那一天听取了很多人的证词。老德姆代克没有出庭，因为在法官到达之前，她已经在5月份死去了。

我和诺埃尔先生的用人在一起等候出庭。当看守叫到我的名字时，我穿过一扇大门往前走去，看见了桌子后面的法官大人。布罗姆利法官十分富有并且地位显赫，但是他的眼睛冰冷无情。突然，我看到了妈妈！她又脏又瘦。当她看见我时，她的脸变红了。当时我的头发很干净，我还穿着鞋子和一条挺贵的裙子。我从她的眼神中看出：她恨我！

“你是女巫吗？”布罗姆利法官问妈妈。

“不，我不是。”我妈妈生气地回答。

“你是不是害死了巴利村的杰克·鲁滨逊？”

“不，我没有。”

“詹妮特·迪瓦斯就在这里。”一个声音平静地说。那是诺埃尔先生。“她可以告诉我们有关她母亲的真实情况。”

有一小会儿，我的妈妈一动不动。随后她跑着穿过房间，向我大喊：“你什么也不知道，你这个坏孩子！我是你妈妈，别忘了这点！”

看守们追着我妈妈，把她拉倒在地上。

“我不是女巫！”妈妈喊道，“那全是谎言！詹妮特，你是个女巫——魔鬼的孩子！你是我女儿，我知道 ！”

我很害怕，用手挡住眼睛。我不想看到妈妈那张丑陋的脸。看守们把妈妈拉出了房间，吵嚷声止住了。

“詹妮特·迪瓦斯，”法官说，“把你母亲的真实情况告诉我们。”

罗杰·诺埃尔把我举起来，放在法官前面的一张桌子上。

“我的妈妈是个女巫，”我说道，“她有一个朋友，是一条名叫鲍尔的狗。当她想杀死谁的时候，她就告诉鲍尔……”我讲啊，讲啊，把一切都告诉了法官。

布罗姆利法官仔细地听着。“我的孩子，这是真的吗？”

“是的，”我回答说，“我说的都是真话。”

看守们又把我妈妈带回了房间。她面带倦容，眼睛红红的。

“伊丽莎白·迪瓦斯，你的女儿对我们讲了你的狗鲍尔的事。另外你的儿子对我们说了泥像的事。我们什么都知道了。”

我妈妈一声不吭。她既没有看法官，也没有看我。

接下来，看守们把我的哥哥詹姆斯带进了房间。当我看到哥哥时，我真想哭。詹姆斯又脏又瘦，头发长长的。他看了看法官和房间里有钱有势的人，哭了起来。然后，他坐在地上。

“站起来，詹姆斯·迪瓦斯。”布罗姆利法官说。

看守们把詹姆斯拖了起来，但是他又倒在了地上。

“你害死了达克沃思先生。”布罗姆利法官说。

“我想要件衬衣。”詹姆斯大声说。

“你哥哥是巫师吗？”布罗姆利法官问我。

“是。”我说。我哥哥张着嘴坐在地上。他看了我一眼，可是没认出我来。因为我很干净、胖乎乎的，那是由于在里德宅院吃得很好的缘故。

“詹姆斯给我讲过他的朋友丹迪的事，”我说，“丹迪是魔鬼，并且——”

詹姆斯听到丹迪这个名字，又哭了起来：“我要丹迪！我想回家！”

看守们把他从地上拉起来，带了出去。从此，我再也没有见过哥哥。

当看守们把我姐姐艾丽森带到法官前面时，我什么话都没说。小贩约翰·劳走进了房间。他变得非常瘦，走路、说话都很缓慢，一脸病容。他对法官讲述了那一天在科恩村附近，艾丽森诅咒他以及她的狗追赶他的事情。

“我很抱歉！”艾丽森说，“那天我很生你的气，不过现在我感到抱歉。”艾丽森的眼睛黑黑的，流露出恐惧。但是在那个房间里她没有一个朋友，没有人肯听她的话。

后来，诺埃尔先生把我领了出去，我和他的用人在另外一个房间里等着。一小时后，传来了许多人的哭嚷声。

用人笑了。“审判结束了，”他说，“你是个好孩子，詹妮特，你把有关巫师们的真相告诉了法官。”

诺埃尔先生把我带回里德宅院。1612年8月20日，看守们把我的妈妈、姐姐和哥哥押出监狱，在兰开斯特城堡前绞死了他们。

就这样我失去了我的家人。

当我还是个孩子时，我希望过得快乐。我想穿得暖和，想有鞋穿，有好东西吃。我盼望有人来关心我。仅此而已。我的妈妈什么也没有给过我。她从未给过我一点爱。她从不关心我。因为妈妈是女巫，我的父亲跑掉了，我根本不知道他是谁。他是一个没有名字的有钱人，而我却和女巫一起生活，过着饥寒交迫的日子。因此，我把我一家的真相告诉了布罗姆利法官。我错了吗？我不知道。

在里德宅院我幸福地生活了很多年。21年来，我忘记了我的家人。我学着为诺埃尔一家做饭；虽然每天工作很长时间，但是我穿得暖吃得好。每个星期天，我穿上最好的衣服去教堂祈祷；每年夏天我在潘德尔山上漫步。我从未想到过我的家人，因为我在里德宅院生活得很愉快。

1612年8月，看守们在兰开斯特城堡前绞死了我的一家。然而他们死去的面孔在那里等待着我。一年前，也就是1633年，看守们把我关进了兰开斯特城堡监狱。在狱中，我又遇到了他们。日复一日，我能看见他们丑陋的死去的面孔，听得到他们冰冷、气愤的声音。我总是想到他们。上帝在这里，在监狱中与我同在，对此我深信不疑。可是我死去的家人也与我同在。

基尔德威克教堂的韦伯斯特先生又来看我了。他那双蓝眼睛尽是疲惫，但是他向我微笑着。

“埃德蒙·鲁滨逊和他父亲在伦敦说了实话，”他轻声说，“那个孩子过去所说的有关你的事都是扯谎，因为他害怕他父亲。他希望父亲爱他。”

我什么也没说。韦伯斯特先生尽量和善地待我，可是他帮不了我。诺埃尔先生也无法帮我，因为他已经去世了。埃德蒙·鲁滨逊只是个孩子；他今天说谎，明天说真话，但是真话也帮不了我。我能做什么来对抗仇恨和谎言呢？诺埃尔先生在世时，村民们没有议论过我。然而诺埃尔先生去世后，谎言便开始流传起来。村民们都害怕我——因为我姓迪瓦斯。他们恨我——因为我姓迪瓦斯。他们说我是女巫——因为我姓迪瓦斯。

我来自巫师之家，可我不是巫师。我从未咒死过任何人。我从未制作过泥像。我从未养过猫或狗。我只想在里德宅院平静地生活，我只想凝望潘德尔山顶上那片不断变化的天空。

孩提时代，我总是挨饿受冻，我恨我的家人，因为他们都是巫师。1612年，我说了真话，而真话害死了我的一家。22年后的今天，谎言将使我在兰开斯特城堡中丧生，我再次陷入了饥寒交迫的苦难中。

韦伯斯特先生给了我面包，我又回到了牢房里。我再也无法重归里德宅院了；现在我知道这点了。我必须待在兰开斯特城堡监狱里，和我死去的一家在一起。

他们正在注视着我，等待着我，我永远也无法摆脱他们。

这是我的真实故事；就讲到这儿吧。

简　介

你相信有鬼吗？当然不会相信。我们喜欢谈论鬼，喜欢讲述关于鬼的故事，但我们并非真的相信有鬼……是不是？

1880年，在巴黎歌剧院发生了一件不可思议的事情：一个舞蹈演员在黑暗的走廊里遇见了鬼。它穿越墙壁来到她的面前，它的脸上没有眼睛；一个舞台工人看见一个穿黑色晚礼服的男人，但他却有一个死人般的头颅，黄色的面孔，并且没有鼻子；人们听到另一个房间里有声音，而那个房间却是空的。

这就是歌剧院的幽灵……

一个名叫盖斯顿·勒罗克斯的法国人最早创作了这个关于歌剧院的幽灵的故事。他的书很受欢迎，1925年它被拍成一部美国无声电影，由著名演员朗·钱尼扮演幽灵。从那以后，已经出现了许多其他的电影和戏剧，以及最近由安德鲁·劳埃德·韦伯创作的著名的英国音乐剧。

本书作者詹妮弗·巴塞特是一位经验丰富的教师和作家。她生活和工作在英国西南部的德文郡。

1The dancers

The dancers

'Quick! Quick! Close the door! It's him!' Annie Sorelli ran into the dressing-room, her face white.

One of the girls ran and closed the door, and then they all turned to Annie Sorelli.

'Who? Where? What's the matter?' they cried.

'It's the ghost!' Annie said. 'In the passage. I saw him. He came through the wall in front of me! And... and I saw his face!'

Most of the girls were afraid, but one of them, a tall girl with black hair, laughed.

'Pooh!' she said. 'Everybody says they see the Opera ghost, but there isn't really a ghost. You saw a shadow on the wall.' But she did not open the door, or look into the passage.

'Lots of people see him,' a second girl said. 'Joseph Buquet saw him two days ago. Don't you remember?'

Then all the girls began to talk at once.

'Joseph says the ghost is tall and he wears a black evening coat.'

'He has the head of a dead man, with a yellow face and no nose...'

'...And no eyes—only black holes!'

Then little Meg Giry spoke for the first time. 'Don't talk about him. He doesn't like it. My mother told me.'

'Your mother?' the girl with black hair said. 'What does your mother know about the ghost?'

'She says that Joseph Buquet is a fool. The ghost doesn't like people talking about him, and one day Joseph Buquet is going to be sorry, very sorry.'

'But what does your mother know? Tell us, tell us!' all the girls cried.

'Oh dear!' said Meg. 'But please don't say a word to anyone. You know my mother is the doorkeeper for some of the boxes in the Opera House. Well, Box 5 is the ghost's box! He watches the operas from that box, and sometimes he leaves flowers for my mother!'

'The ghost has a box! And leaves flowers in it!'

'Oh, Meg, your mother's telling you stories! How can the ghost have a box?'

'It's true, it's true, I tell you!' Meg said. 'Nobody buys tickets for Box 5, but the ghost always comes to it on opera nights.'

'So somebody does come there?'

'Why, no!... The ghost comes, but there is nobody there.'

The dancers looked at Meg. 'But how does your mother know?' one of them asked.

'There's no man in a black evening coat, with a yellow face. That's all wrong. My mother never sees the ghost in Box 5, but she hears him! He talks to her, but there is nobody there! And he doesn't like people talking about him!'

But that evening the dancers could not stop talking about the Opera ghost. They talked before the opera, all through the opera, and after the opera. But they talked very quietly, and they looked behind them before they spoke.

When the opera finished, the girls went back to their dressing-room. Suddenly, they heard somebody in the passage, and Madame Giry, Meg's mother, ran into the room. She was a fat, motherly woman, with a red, happy face. But tonight her face was white.

'Oh girls,' she cried. 'Joseph Buquet is dead! You know he walks a long way down, on the fourth floor under the stage. The other stage workers found his dead body there an hour ago—with a rope around his neck!'

'It's the ghost!' cried Meg Giry. 'The ghost killed him!'

1 ．舞蹈演员们

“快！快！关门！是他！”安妮·索雷丽跑进化妆室，脸色苍白。

一个姑娘跑过去把门关上，然后她们都转向安妮·索雷丽。

“谁？在哪里？发生了什么事？”她们叫道。

“有鬼！”安妮说，“在走廊上，我看到了他。他穿过墙壁来到我的面前！我还……还看到了他的脸！”

绝大多数姑娘都很害怕，但她们中的一个高个子的黑发姑娘却大笑起来。

“呸！”她说，“每个人都说他们看到了这个歌剧院的幽灵，但是这里其实并没有鬼。你看见的只是墙上的影子。”但是她没有去把门打开，也没有到走廊上去看个究竟。

“许多人都看到过他，”又一个姑娘说，“约瑟夫·比凯两天前也看到过他，你们难道不记得了？”

随后所有的姑娘们立即开始谈论此事。

“约瑟夫说这幽灵是个高个子，穿着黑色的晚礼服。”

“他有一个死人般的头颅，黄色面孔，没有鼻子……”

“……而且没有眼睛——只是黑洞！”

接着娇小的梅格·吉里第一次开口说话了：“不要谈论他。他不喜欢这样。我妈妈告诉我的。”

“你妈妈？”黑头发的姑娘问，“关于这幽灵的事儿，你妈妈都知道些什么？”

“她说约瑟夫·比凯是个傻瓜。这幽灵不喜欢人们谈论他，总有一天约瑟夫·比凯会后悔的，会非常后悔的。”

“但是你妈妈都知道些什么？告诉我们，告诉我们！”所有的姑娘都叫道。

“哦，天啊！”梅格说，“但是请不要跟任何人说一个字。你们知道我妈妈是歌剧院一些包厢的看门人。瞧！五号包厢就是这幽灵专用的！他在那个包厢看歌剧，并且有时候会留下一些鲜花给我妈妈！”

“这幽灵还有包厢！而且在包厢里留下鲜花！”

“哦，梅格，你妈妈在给你讲故事吧！幽灵怎么会有包厢呢？”

“这是真的，这是真的，我告诉你们！”梅格说，“没有人买五号包厢的票，但是这个幽灵却总是在晚上演歌剧时到包厢里来。”

“确实有人在那儿啦？”

“噢，不！……只有幽灵来，但是那里一个人也没有。”

舞蹈演员们看着梅格。“但是你妈妈是怎么知道的？”其中一个问道。

“这里根本没有穿黑色晚礼服、长着黄色面孔的男人。那都是瞎扯。我妈妈从来没有在五号包厢里看到过这个幽灵，但是她听到过！他跟她说话，然而里面却没有人！而且他不喜欢人们谈论他！”

但是那个晚上舞蹈演员们却无法不谈论歌剧院的幽灵。她们在歌剧开演前谈论着，在歌剧整个演出过程中谈论着，在歌剧演出结束后还谈论着。但是她们谈话的声音很小，而且她们在说话前总要先看看她们的身后的动静。

当歌剧演出结束的时候，姑娘们回到了她们的化妆室。突然，她们听到走廊上有动静，接着吉里夫人，也就是梅格的母亲，跑进了房间。她是一个肥胖的、慈母般的妇人，有一张红扑扑的、快乐的脸。但是今晚她的脸色却是苍白的。

“哦，姑娘们，”她叫道，“约瑟夫·比凯死了！你们知道他要一直往下走很深，走到舞台底下的第4层。别的舞台杂工一个小时以前在那里发现了他的尸体——有一根绳子绕在他的脖子上！”

“是幽灵！”梅格·吉里叫道，“是那个幽灵杀死了他！”

2The directors of the Opera House

The directors of the Opera House

The Opera House was famous, and the directors of the Opera House were very important men. It was the first week of work for the two new directors, Monsieur Armand Moncharmin and Monsieur Firmin Richard. In the directors' office the next day, the two men talked about Joseph Buquet.

'It was an accident,' Monsieur Armand said angrily. 'Or Buquet killed himself.'

'An accident?... Killed himself?' Monsieur Firmin said. 'Which story do you want, my friend? Or do you want the story of the ghost?'

'Don't talk to me about ghosts!' Monsieur Armand said. 'We have 1,500 people working for us in this Opera House, and everybody is talking about the ghost. They're all mad! I don't want to hear about the ghost, OK?'

Monsieur Firmin looked at a letter on the table next to him. 'And what are we going to do about this letter, Armand?'

'Do?' cried Monsieur Armand. 'Why, do nothing, of course! What can we do?'

The two men read the letter again. It wasn't very long.

To the new directors

Because you are new in the Opera House, I am writing to tell you some important things. Never sell tickets for Box 5; that is my box for every opera night. Madame Giry, the doorkeeper, knows all about it. Also, I need money for my work in the Opera House. I am not expensive, and I am happy to take only 20,000 francs a month. That is all. But please remember, I can be a good friend, but a bad enemy.

O. G.

'Don't sell tickets for Box 5! 20,000 francs a month!' Monsieur Armand was very angry again. 'That's the best box in the Opera House, and we need the money, Firmin! And who is this O. G. ,eh? Tell me that!'

'Opera Ghost, of course,' Monsieur Firmin said. 'But you're right, Armand. We can do nothing about this letter. It's a joke, a bad joke. Somebody thinks we are fools, because we are new here. There are no ghosts in the Opera House!'

The two men then talked about the opera for that night. It was Faust , and usually La Carlotta sang Margarita. La Carlotta was Spanish, and the best singer in Paris. But today, La Carlotta was ill.

'Everybody in Paris is going to be at the opera tonight,' said Monsieur Armand, 'and our best singer is ill. Suddenly! She writes a letter to us just this morning—she is ill, she cannot sing tonight!'

'Don't get angry again, Armand,' Monsieur Firmin said quickly. 'We have Christine Daaé, that young singer from Norway. She can sing Margarita tonight. She has a good voice.'

'But she's so young, and nobody knows her! Nobody wants to listen to a new singer.'

'Wait and see. Perhaps Daaé can sing better than La Carlotta. Who knows?'

mad adj. ill in the mind . 精神错乱的；疯的。

mad

enemy n. a person who hates or dislikes another person . 敌人；仇敌。

enemy

joke n. anything said or done to cause laughter or amusement . 笑话；玩笑。

joke

perhaps adv. it may be; possibly . 可能，也许。

2 ．歌剧院的经理们

歌剧院很著名，而歌剧院的经理们也都是些非常显要的人物。这是两位新经理阿曼德·蒙沙曼先生和弗明·理查德先生上任的第一个星期。第二天，在经理办公室里，这两位先生谈起了约瑟夫·比凯的事。

“这是个意外事故，”阿曼德先生气愤地说，“要不然比凯就是自杀的。”

“意外事故？……自杀？”弗明先生说，“你想要听哪一类故事，我的朋友？或者说你想听一个关于幽灵的故事？”

“不要跟我谈关于幽灵的事！”阿曼德先生说，“这个歌剧院里有1,500人在为我们工作，而每个人都在谈论关于幽灵的事。他们都疯了！我不想听到幽灵的事，行不行？”

弗明先生看着他身旁桌子上的一封信。“那我们该拿这封信怎么办，阿曼德？”

“拿它怎么办？”阿曼德先生叫道，“噢，当然是什么也不做了！我们又能做些什么呢？”

两位先生又读了一遍这封信。信并不很长。

致新任经理们

因为你们是歌剧院的新任经理，所以我写信告诉你们一些重要的事情。不要出售五号包厢的票；那是我观看每一场晚场歌剧的包厢。吉里夫人，那位看门人，知道这一切。除此之外，我还需要在歌剧院工作的工钱。我要价并不高，一个月拿两万法郎我就感到满足了。就这些。但是请记住，我会是一个好朋友，也会是一个死对头。

O. G. （注：O. G. 即Opera Ghost的缩写。）

“不要出售五号包厢的票！两万法郎一个月！”阿曼德先生又来气了，“那是歌剧院最好的包厢，而且我们需要钱，弗明！谁是这个O. G. 啊？告诉我！”

“自然是歌剧院的幽灵了，”弗明先生说，“但你是对的，阿曼德。我们绝对不能按照信上说的那么做。这是一个玩笑，一个恶毒的玩笑。有人认为我们是傻瓜，因为我们是新来的。歌剧院里根本就没有幽灵！”

然后这两位先生就谈论起当晚的歌剧来。当晚上演的歌剧是《浮士德》，通常由拉·卡洛塔演唱玛格丽塔。拉·卡洛塔是西班牙人，是巴黎最好的歌唱家。但是今天，拉·卡洛塔却病了。

“今晚巴黎的每个人都会到歌剧院来，”阿曼德先生说，“而我们最好的歌唱家却病了。突然间就病了！她今天上午方才写信给我们——她病了，她今晚不能演唱了！”

“不要再生气了，阿曼德，”弗明先生急忙说，“我们有克里斯廷·达埃，那个年轻的挪威歌唱家。她今晚可以演唱玛格丽塔那个角色。她有一副好嗓子。”

“但是她太年轻了，而且没有人知道她！没有人想听一个新手的演唱。”

“等着瞧吧。也许达埃会比拉·卡洛塔唱得更好。谁知道呢？”

3Christine Daaé

Christine Daaé

Monsieur Firmin was right. All Paris talked about the new Margarita in Faust , the girl with the beautiful voice, the girl with the voice of an angel. People loved her. They laughed and cried and called for more. Daaé was wonderful, the best singer in the world!

Behind the stage Meg Giry looked at Annie Sorelli. 'Christine Daaé never sang like that before,' she said to Annie. 'Why was she so good tonight?'

'Perhaps she's got a new music teacher,' Annie said.

The noise in the Opera House went on for a long time. In Box 14, Philippe, the Comte de Chagny, turned to his younger brother and smiled.

'Well, Raoul, what did you think of Daaé tonight?'

Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, was twenty-one years old. He had blue eyes and black hair, and a wonderful smile. The Chagny family was old and rich, and many girls in Paris were in love with the young Vicomte. But Raoul was not interested in them.

He smiled back at his brother. 'What can I say? Christine is an angel, that's all. I'm going to her dressing-room to see her tonight.'

Philippe laughed. He was twenty years older than Raoul, and was more like a father than a brother.

'Ah, I understand,' he said. 'You are in love! But this is your first night in Paris, your first visit to the opera. How do you know Christine Daaé?'

'You remember four years ago, when I was on holiday by the sea, in Brittany?' Raoul said. 'Well, I met Christine there. I was in love with her then, and I'm still in love with her today!'

The Comte de Chagny looked at his brother. 'Mmm, I see,' he said slowly. 'Well, Raoul, remember she is only an opera singer. We know nothing about her family.'

But Raoul did not listen. To him, good families were not important, and young men never listen to their older brothers.

There were many people in Christine Daaé's dressing-room that night. But there was a doctor with Christine, and her beautiful face looked white and ill. Raoul went quickly across the room and took her hand.

'Christine! What's the matter? Are you ill?' He went down on the floor by her chair. 'Don't you remember me— Raoul de Chagny, in Brittany?'

Christine looked at him, and her blue eyes were afraid. She took her hand away. 'No, I don't know you. Please go away. I'm not well.'

Raoul stood up, his face red. Before he could speak, the doctor said quickly, 'Yes, yes, please go away. Everybody, please leave the room. Mademoiselle Daaé needs to be quiet. She is very tired.'

He moved to the door, and soon everybody left the room. Christine Daaé was alone in her dressing-room.

Outside in the passage the young Vicomte was angry and unhappy. How could Christine forget him? How could she say that to him? He waited for some minutes, then, very quietly and carefully, he went back to the door of her dressing-room. But he did not open the door, because just then he heard a man's voice in the room!

'Christine, you must love me!' the voice said.

Then Raoul heard Christine's voice. 'How can you talk like that? When I sing only for you...? Tonight, I gave everything to you, everything. And now I'm so tired.' Her voice was unhappy and afraid.

'You sang like an angel,' the man's voice said.

Raoul walked away. So that was the answer! Christine Daaé had a lover. But why was her voice so unhappy? He waited in the shadows near her room. He wanted to see her lover—his enemy!

After about ten minutes Christine came out of her room, alone, and walked away down the passage. Raoul waited, but no man came out after her. There was nobody in the passage, so Raoul went quickly up to the door of the dressing-room, opened it and went in. He closed the door quietly behind him, then called out:

'Where are you? I know you're in here! Come out!'

There was no answer. Raoul looked everywhere—under the chairs, behind all the clothes, in all the dark corners of the room. There was nobody there.

3 ．克里斯廷·达埃

弗明先生说对了。整个巴黎都在谈论歌剧《浮士德》中玛格丽塔的新演唱者，那个有着美妙歌喉的姑娘，那个有着天使一般嗓音的姑娘。人们热爱她。他们笑啊，叫啊，要她再唱一首。达埃的演唱棒极了，她是世界上最好的歌唱家！

在舞台的后面梅格·吉里看着安妮·索雷丽。“克里斯廷·达埃以前从来没有唱得那么好，”她对安妮说，“为什么她今晚唱得这么好呢？”

“或许她已经有了一位新的音乐老师。”安妮说。

歌剧院里的喧闹声持续了很长一段时间。在14号包厢里，菲利普，这位查格尼家族的伯爵，微笑着转向他的弟弟。

“嘿，拉乌尔，你觉得今晚达埃表演得怎么样？”

拉乌尔，这位查格尼家族的子爵21岁。他长着蓝眼睛黑头发，有着迷人的微笑。查格尼家族古老而富有，巴黎的许多姑娘都爱上了这位年轻的子爵，但是拉乌尔对她们却并不感兴趣。

他对他的哥哥报以微笑。“我能说什么呢？克里斯廷是一位天使，就这样。今晚我要去她的化妆室拜访她。”

菲利普笑了。他比拉乌尔大20岁，与其说是拉乌尔的兄长，倒不如说是他的父亲。

“啊，我明白了，”他说，“你恋爱了！但是这是你在巴黎的第一个夜晚，是你第一次来这座歌剧院。你是如何认识克里斯廷·达埃的呢？”

“你还记得四年前，我在布列塔尼海边度假的时候吗？”拉乌尔说，“喔，我在那儿遇见了克里斯廷。当时我就爱上了她，而且今天我还爱着她！”

这位查格尼家族的伯爵看着他的弟弟。“嗯，我明白了，”他一字一顿地说，“噢，拉乌尔，记住，她只是一个歌剧演员。我们对她的家庭一无所知。”

但是拉乌尔听不进去。对他来说，好的家庭并不重要，而且年轻人从来都听不进他们兄长的劝告。

那天晚上克里斯廷·达埃的化妆室里有很多人。但是克里斯廷的身边还有一位医生，而且她美丽的面容带有病色，显得苍白。拉乌尔快步穿过房间，握住她的手。

“克里斯廷！怎么了？你病了吗？”他走到她的座椅旁，“你不记得我了——查格尼家族的拉乌尔，在布列塔尼？”

克里斯廷看着他，她那蓝色的眼睛带着惊恐。她把她的手抽走。“不，我不认识你。请走吧。我身体不太好。”

拉乌尔站起来，他的脸红了。他还没来得及说话，那位医生就急忙抢着说：“对，对，请走吧。各位，请离开这房间。达埃小姐需要安静。她太累了。”

他走向门口，不久所有的人都离开了那个房间，只留下克里斯廷·达埃独自待在她的化妆室里。

在门外的走廊上年轻的子爵感到不悦和扫兴。克里斯廷怎么会忘了他？她怎么会对他说那些话？他等了几分钟，然后，轻轻地，小心翼翼地，他又回到她的化妆室门口。但是他没有把门推开，因为就在这个时候他听到屋里有一个男人的声音 ！

“克里斯廷，你必须爱我！”那个声音说。

接着拉乌尔听到克里斯廷的声音。“你怎么能那样跟我说话？在我只为你歌唱的时候……？今晚，我把一切都给了你，一切。而现在我太累了。”她的声音显得愁苦而害怕。

“你唱得像一位天使。”那个男人的声音说。

拉乌尔走开了。这么说那就是答案！克里斯廷·达埃有一个情人。但是为什么她的声音如此不悦？他在她房间附近的一处阴影里等着。他要看看她的情人——他的情敌！

大约过了10分钟左右，克里斯廷从她的房间里出来了。她独自一人沿走廊走了过去。拉乌尔等着，但是没有男人跟着她出来。走廊上没有人，于是拉乌尔快步来到化妆室门前，推门而入。他轻轻地把身后的门关上，然后喊道：

“你在哪里？我知道你在这儿！出来！”

没有回答。拉乌尔找遍了所有地方——椅子下面、所有的衣服背后、房间里的每一个阴暗角落。但毫无人影。

4The Phantom is angry

The Phantom is angry

That was Tuesday night. On Wednesday morning Monsieur Armand and Monsieur Firmin were happy men. Paris liked the new Margarita—everything in life was good. The next opera night was Friday. It was Faust again, but this time with La Carlotta singing Margarita.

By Wednesday afternoon they were not so happy. A second letter arrived for them—from O. G.

Why don't you listen to me? I am getting angry. Leave Box 5 free for me. And where are my 20,000 francs? On Friday Daaé must sing Margarita again. She is now the best singer in Paris. La Carlotta cannot sing—she has a very ugly voice, like a toad.

Remember, I am a bad enemy. O. G.

'So, Firmin, is this still a joke?' Monsieur Armand shouted. 'What are we going to do now, eh? Is O. G. the director here, or are we?'

'Don't shout, Armand,' said Monsieur Firmin tiredly. 'I don't know the answers. Let's talk to Madame Giry, the doorkeeper of Box 5. Perhaps she can help us.'

But Madame Giry was not helpful. Madame Giry was not afraid of ghosts, and she was not afraid of directors of Opera Houses.

'People say that you're a friend of the Opera ghost, Madame Giry,' Monsieur Armand began. 'Tell us about him. Some people say he has no head.'

'And some people say he has no body,' said Monsieur Firmin. 'What do you say, Madame Giry?'

Madame Giry looked at the two men and laughed. 'I say that the directors of the Opera House are fools!'

'What!' Monsieur Armand shouted. He stood up, and his face was red and angry. 'Listen to me, woman—'

'Oh, sit down, Armand, and listen,' said Monsieur Firmin. 'Why do you say that, Madame Giry?'

'Because, Monsieur, the Opera ghost is angry with you. When the ghost wants something, he must have it. He is clever and dangerous, this ghost. The old directors before you, they knew that, oh yes. At first they tried to stop him. Then there were many accidents in the Opera House, many strange accidents. And when did these accidents happen? When the ghost was angry! So, the old directors learnt very quickly. The ghost wants Box 5? He can have it every night. The ghost wants money? Let's give the money to him at once. Oh yes, the old directors understood very well.'

'But we are the directors, not the Opera ghost!' Monsieur Armand shouted. He turned to Monsieur Firmin. 'This woman is mad. Why do we listen to her? On Friday night La Carlotta is going to sing Margarita. And you and I, Firmin, are going to watch the opera from Box 5.'

'Well, we can try that, Armand. But we don't want any accidents.'

Madame Giry came nearer to the two men. 'Listen to me,' she said quietly. 'Remember Joseph Buquet? I tell you, the Opera ghost is a good friend, but a bad enemy.'

The two men stared at her. 'Those words,' Monsieur Firmin said slowly, 'why did you say those words, Madame Giry?'

'Because the ghost says them to me. I never see him, but I often hear him. He has a very nice voice—and he doesn't shout at people.'

4 ．幽灵发怒了

那是星期二的晚上。星期三上午阿曼德先生和弗明先生成了快乐的人。巴黎喜欢玛格丽塔的新演唱者——生活中的一切都是美好的。下一场晚场歌剧是在星期五，又是《浮士德》，但是这一次由拉·卡洛塔演唱玛格丽塔。

到星期三下午他们就不那么快乐了。第二封信送到了他们手中——来自O. G. 的信。

你们为什么不听我的话？我会发怒的。把五号包厢空着留给我。另外我的两万法郎在哪里？星期五达埃必须再次演唱玛格丽塔。她是当今巴黎最好的歌唱家。拉·卡洛塔不能演唱——她的声音非常难听，活像一只癞蛤蟆。

记住，我是一个死对头。O. G.

“如此看来，弗明，这还是一个玩笑吗？”阿曼德先生喊道，“现在我们该做些什么，啊？这里的经理是O. G. ，还是我们？”

“不要喊叫，阿曼德，”弗明先生有气无力地说，“我也不知道如何是好。让我们同吉里夫人，那个5号包厢的看门人谈一谈。或许她能帮助我们。”

但是吉里夫人帮不了什么忙。吉里夫人并不怕幽灵，也不怕歌剧院的经理们。

“人们说你是歌剧院幽灵的朋友，吉里夫人，”阿曼德先生打开了话题，“告诉我们有关他的情况。有人说他没有脑袋。”

“而有人说他没有身体，”弗明先生说，“你说呢，吉里夫人？”

吉里夫人看着这两个人大笑起来。“我说歌剧院的经理们都是傻瓜！”

“什么！”阿曼德先生喊道。他站了起来，满脸通红，面显怒色。“听我说，小娘们——”

“哦，坐下，阿曼德，听她说，”弗明先生说，“你为什么那样说，吉里夫人？”

“因为，先生，这歌剧院的幽灵对你们发怒了。因为这幽灵想要什么，他就必须得到它。这个幽灵是聪明而危险的。你们的那些前任深谙此道，哦，是这样的。刚开始他们试图阻止他。接着在歌剧院里就发生了许多事故，许多意想不到的事故。而那些事故什么时候发生呢？就是这幽灵发怒的时候！所以，那些前任经理们很快就知道该怎么做了。这幽灵想要五号包厢？他可以每个晚上都拥有它。这幽灵想要钱？让我们马上把钱给他。哦对了，那些老经理们领会得很好。”

“但是经理是我们 ，而不是这歌剧院的幽灵！”阿曼德先生喊道。他转向弗明先生。“这个女人疯了。我们为什么要听她的？星期五晚上由拉·卡洛塔演唱玛格丽塔。而你和我，弗明，到五号包厢里去观看歌剧。”

“好，我们可以那样试试，阿曼德。但是我们不希望发生任何事故。”

吉里夫人走近这两个人。“听我说，”她轻声道：“记得约瑟夫·比凯吗？我告诉你们，这歌剧院的幽灵会是一个好朋友，但也会是一个死对头。”

这两个人凝视着她。“那些话，”弗明先生一字一顿地说，“你为什么说那些话，吉里夫人？”

“因为这幽灵跟我说过那些话。我从来没有见过他，但是我经常听到他说话。他有一副很好的嗓子——而且不对人喊叫。”

5A letter for Raoul

A letter for Raoul

That Wednesday a letter also arrived for the young Vicomte de Chagny. He opened the letter, saw the name at the bottom, and smiled for the first time that day.

Dear Raoul

Of course I remember you! How could I forget you? Meet me on Thursday at three o'clock in the Tuileries Gardens. Don't be angry with me, Raoul, please.

Christine Daaé

Raoul put the letter carefully into his pocket. Angry? How could he be angry with an angel? On Thursday he was in the Tuileries Gardens by two o'clock.

At ten past three he began to feel unhappy. At half past three he wanted to die, or to kill somebody.

And then... she came. She ran through the gardens to him, and in a second she was in his arms.

'Oh, Christine!' he said, again and again. 'Oh, Christine!' They walked through the gardens together and talked for a long time. They remembered their happy weeks in Brittany, four years ago.

'But why did you go away, Christine?' Raoul asked. 'Why didn't you write to me?'

For a minute or two Christine said nothing. Then she said slowly, 'We were so young, you and I. I was just a poor singer from Norway, and you... you were the Vicomte de Chagny. I knew I could never be your wife.'

'But I love you, Christine—'

'No, shh. Listen to me, Raoul, please. I went home to Norway, and a year later, my father died. I was very unhappy, but I came back to France, to Paris. I worked and worked at my singing, because I wanted to be an opera singer. Not just a good singer, but the best opera singer in Paris.'

'And now you are,' Raoul said. He smiled. 'All Paris is at your feet.'

Christine turned her face away and said nothing.

'Christine,' Raoul said quietly. 'I want to ask you a question. Who was the man in your dressing-room on Tuesday night? Tell me, please!'

Christine stopped and stared at him. Her face went white. 'What man?' she whispered. 'There was no man in my dressing-room on Tuesday night.'

Raoul put his hand on her arm. 'I heard him,' he said. 'I listened outside the door and heard a man's voice. Who was he?'

'Don't ask me, Raoul! There was a man's voice, yes, but there was no man in my room! It's true! Oh, Raoul, I'm so afraid. Sometimes I want to die.'

'Who is he? Tell me, Christine, please. I'm your friend, I can help you. Tell me his name!'

'I cannot tell you his name. It's a secret,' whispered Christine. 'I never see him, I only hear his voice. But he is everywhere! He sees everything, hears everything. That's why I didn't speak to you on Tuesday night. He is my music teacher, Raoul. He's a wonderful singer. I sang so well on Tuesday night because of him. I am famous because of him. He is my angel of music! And he says he loves me. How can I leave him?'

5 ．一封致拉乌尔的信

那个星期三也有一封信到了年轻的查格尼家族的子爵手里。他打开信，看到信末尾的署名，露出了那天的第一个微笑。

亲爱的拉乌尔：

我当然记得你！我怎么会忘了你呢？星期四下午3点到杜伊勒利花园来见我。请不要生我的气，拉乌尔。

克里斯廷·达埃

拉乌尔小心翼翼地把这封信放进他的衣服口袋里。生气吗？他怎么会生一位天使的气呢？星期四还不到两点他就到了杜伊勒利花园。

3点10分的时候他开始感到不快。到了3点半的时候他想死掉，或者杀人。

随后……她来了。她穿过花园奔向他，一下子扑到他怀里。

“哦，克里斯廷！”他一遍又一遍地说，“哦，克里斯廷！”他们一同漫步着穿过花园并且谈了很长时间。他们回忆起四年前在布列塔尼的快乐时光。

“但是你为什么离开那里了，克里斯廷？”拉乌尔问，“你为什么不给我写信？”

克里斯廷沉默了一两分钟，然后她才慢慢地说：“你我都太年轻，我只是一个从挪威来的贫穷的歌唱家，而你……你是查格尼家族的子爵。我知道我不可能成为你的妻子。”

“但是我爱你，克里斯廷——”

“不，嘘，请听我说，拉乌尔。我回到了挪威，一年后，我父亲去世了。我非常悲伤，但是我回到了法国，来到了巴黎。我拼命地唱啊唱啊，因为我想成为一名歌剧演唱家。不仅仅是优秀的歌唱家，而是巴黎最好的歌剧演唱家。”

“现在你是了，”拉乌尔说。他微笑着，“整个巴黎都拜倒在你的脚下。”

克里斯廷转过脸去，沉默不语。

“克里斯廷，”拉乌尔轻声说，“我想问你一个问题。星期二晚上在你化妆室里的那个男人是谁？请告诉我！”

克里斯廷停下来凝视着他。她的脸变白了。“什么男人？”她低语道，“星期二晚上没有男人在我的化妆室里。”

拉乌尔把手放在她的手臂上。“我听到他的声音了，”他说：“我在门外听，听到了一个男人的声音。他是谁？”

“不要问我，拉乌尔！是有一个男人的声音，是的，但是我的房间里没有男人！这是真的！哦，拉乌尔，我害怕极了。有时候我真想去死。”

“他是谁？请告诉我，克里斯廷。我是你的朋友，我会帮助你。告诉我他的名字！”

“我不能告诉你他的名字。这是一个秘密，”克里斯廷低声道，“我从来没有见过他，我只是听到他的声音。但是他无处不在！他什么都看得到，什么都听得到。那就是我星期二晚上没有和你说话的原因。他是我的音乐老师，拉乌尔。他是一个极好的歌唱家。我星期二晚上之所以唱得那么好就是因为他。我之所以出名就是因为他。他是我的音乐天使！而他说他爱我。我怎么能离开他呢？”

6La Carlotta sings Margarita

La Carlotta sings Margarita

On Friday morning La Carlotta had her breakfast in bed. She drank her coffee and opened her morning letters. One letter had no name on it. It was very short.

You are ill. You cannot sing Margarita tonight. Stay at home and don't go to the Opera House. Accidents can happen. Do you want to lose your voice—for ever?

La Carlotta was very, very angry. She got out of bed at once and did not finish her breakfast.

'This is from Christine Daaé's friends,' she thought. 'They want her to sing again tonight. That Daaé girl is going to be sorry for this! I, La Carlotta, I am the best opera singer in Paris. And nothing is going to stop me singing Margarita tonight!'

At six o'clock that evening the dancers were in their dressing-room. They talked and laughed and put on their red and black dresses for Faust . But Meg Giry was very quiet.

'What's the matter, Meg?' Annie Sorelli asked.

'It's the Opera ghost,' Meg said. 'My mother says he's angry. She's afraid that something's going to happen tonight.'

'Oh, pooh!' the girl with black hair said. 'Who's afraid of an old ghost?'

An hour later Monsieur Armand and Monsieur Firmin went into Box 5 and sat down. They were not afraid of ghosts. Of course not. There were no ghosts in the Opera House.

Then Monsieur Armand saw some flowers on the floor by the door of the box. 'Firmin,' he whispered, 'did you put those flowers there?'

Monsieur Firmin looked. 'No, I didn't,' he whispered back. 'Did you?'

'Of course not, you fool! Shh, the music's beginning.'

La Carlotta did not sing for the first hour. There were no strange voices in Box 5, and the two directors began to feel happier. Then La Carlotta came out onto the stage, and Monsieur Firmin looked at Monsieur Armand.

'Did you hear a voice just then?' he asked quietly.

'No!' Monsieur Armand said, but he looked behind him twice, then three times, and suddenly felt cold.

La Carlotta sang and sang, and nothing happened. Then she began a beautiful love song.

'My love begins to—Co-ack!'

Everybody stared. What was the matter with Carlotta's voice? What was that strange noise—Co-ack?

Carlotta stopped and began the song again.

'My love begins to—Co-ack!

I cannot forget my—Co-ack!'

It was the noise of a toad! People began to talk and laugh. Monsieur Firmin put his head in his hands. Then he felt Monsieur Armand's hand on his arm. There was a voice in the box with them! A man's voice, laughing!

Poor Carlotta tried again, and again.

'I cannot forget my—Co-ack!'

Then the two directors heard the voice again, behind them, in front of them, everywhere. 'Her singing tonight is going to bring down the chandelier !'

The two directors looked up at the top of the Opera House. Their faces were white. The famous chandelier, with its thousand lights, broke away from its ropes and crashed down on to the people below.

That was a terrible night for the Paris Opera House. One woman was killed by the chandelier, and many people were hurt. The Opera House closed for two weeks. And La Carlotta never sang again.

6 ．拉·卡洛塔演唱玛格丽塔

星期五早晨拉·卡洛塔在床上用早餐。她一边喝咖啡一边拆阅她的晨信。有一封信没有署名。它非常短。

你病了。今晚你不能演唱玛格丽塔。待在家里不要去歌剧院。否则会有意外。你想失声吗——永远地？

拉·卡洛塔非常非常气愤。她立即下床，连早餐都没有吃完。

“这是克里斯廷·达埃的朋友写来的，”她想，“他们希望她今晚再次演唱。那个达埃姑娘将为此而感到懊悔！我，拉·卡洛塔，是巴黎最好的歌剧演唱家。没有什么能够阻止我今晚演唱玛格丽塔！”

当天晚上6点钟舞蹈演员们都来到了她们的化妆室。她们一边笑谈着一边穿上她们的红黑的《浮士德》歌剧服。但是梅格·吉丽却一言不发。

“怎么了，梅格？”安妮·索雷丽问。

“是歌剧院的幽灵，”梅格说，“我妈妈说他发怒了。她担心今晚会发生什么事。”

“哦，呸！”那个黑发姑娘说，“谁会害怕什么幽灵？”

一个小时以后阿曼德先生和弗明先生步入五号包厢坐下。他们不害怕幽灵。当然不怕。歌剧院里根本就没有幽灵。

随后阿曼德先生发现包厢门边的地上放着一些鲜花。“弗明，”他轻声问，“是你把那些鲜花放在那里的？”

弗明先生看了看。“不，我没有，”他又轻声反问：“是你吗？”

“当然不是，你这个傻瓜！嘘，歌剧开始了。”

拉·卡洛塔在开始的头一个小时里不演唱。五号包厢里没有异常的声音，于是两位经理开始感觉心情愉快了。接着拉·卡洛塔上了台，这时弗明先生看着阿曼德先生。

“刚才你听到什么声音了吗？”他轻声问。

“没有！”阿曼德先生说，但是他往身后看了两次，随后又看了第三次，并且突然感到一丝凉意。

拉·卡洛塔唱啊唱，并没有发生什么事。接着她开始演唱一首优美的爱情歌曲。

“我的爱始于——呱！”

众人面面相觑。卡洛塔的嗓音怎么了？那个陌生的杂音——呱是什么？

卡洛塔停下来重新开始演唱。

“我的爱始于——呱！”

“我无法忘记我的——呱！”

这是癞蛤蟆的鼓噪！人们开始交头接耳并且哄笑。弗明先生把头埋进双手之中。然后他觉得阿曼德先生的手放在了自己的手臂上。包厢里有一个声音！一个男人的声音，大笑着！

可怜的卡洛塔试了一次又一次。

“我无法忘记我的——呱！”

接着这两位经理又听到了那个声音，它来自身后，面前，各个方向。“今晚她的演唱将会使枝形吊灯落下来！”

两位经理抬头朝歌剧院的屋顶看去。他们的脸色变得惨白。那著名的有着上千盏灯的枝形吊灯，竟然脱离束缚它的绳索坠落在下面的观众席上。

对于巴黎歌剧院来说那是一个可怕的夜晚。一名妇女被枝形吊灯砸死，还有许多人被砸伤。歌剧院为此关闭两周。而拉·卡洛塔从此再没有演唱过。

7My angel of music

My angel of music

For a week Raoul saw Christine every day. Some days Christine was quiet and unhappy, some days she laughed and sang. She never wanted to talk about the Opera House, or her singing, or Raoul's love for her. Raoul was very afraid for her. Who, or what, was this strange teacher, this man's voice, her 'angel of music'?

Then one day there was no Christine. She was not at her home, not at the Opera House, not at their meeting places. Raoul looked everywhere and asked everybody. Where was Christine Daaé? But nobody knew.

Two days before the Opera House opened again, a letter arrived for Raoul. It was from Christine.

Meet me in an hour at the top of the Opera House, on the tenth floor .

The tenth floor of the Opera House was a dangerous place. There were hundreds of ropes going down to the stage below— it was a long, long way down.

Raoul and Christine sat in a dark corner, and Raoul took Christine's hands. Her face was white and tired.

'Listen, Raoul,' she said quietly. 'I'm going to tell you everything. But this is our last meeting. I can never see you again.'

'No, Christine!' Raoul cried. 'I love you, and we—'

'Shh! Quietly! Perhaps he can hear us. He's everywhere in the Opera House, Raoul!'

'Who? What are you talking about, Christine?'

'My angel of music. I couldn't meet you last Saturday because he came for me, and took me away. I was in my dressing-room in the Opera House and suddenly, he was there in front of me! I saw the voice for the first time! He wore black evening clothes and a mask over his face. He took me through many secret doors and passages, down, down under the Opera House. There is a lake down there, a big lake; the waters are black and cold. He took me across the lake in a boat to his house. He lives there, Raoul, in a house on the lake, under the Opera House!'

Raoul stared at her. Was his beautiful Christine mad? Christine saw his face, and said quickly:

'It's true, Raoul, it's true! And he... he is the Phantom of the Opera! But he's not a ghost, he's not an angel of music, he's a man! His name is Erik, and he loves me, he wants me to be his wife! No, Raoul, listen, there is more. He told me all this in his house, in a beautiful room. He said that no woman could ever love him, because of his face. He was so unhappy! Then he took off his mask, and I saw his face.'

She began to cry, and Raoul put his arms around her.

'Oh Raoul, he has the most terrible face! It is so ugly! I wanted to scream and run away. But where could I run to? He has the face of a dead man, Raoul, but he is not dead! He has no nose, just two black holes in his yellow face. And his eyes! Sometimes they are black holes, sometimes they have a terrible red light...'

She put her face in her hands for a second. Then she said, 'I stayed in his house for five days. He was very good to me, and I felt sorry for him, Raoul. He wants me to love him, and I told him... I told him...'

'No, Christine, no! You're going to be my wife! Come away with me at once, today! You can't go back to him.'

'But I must,' Christine said quietly. 'He knows about you, Raoul. He knows about us. He says he's going to kill you. I must go back to him.'

'Never!' said Raoul. 'I love you, Christine, and I'm going to kill this Erik!'

Erik ... Erik ...Erik ... Erik ... The word whispered round the Opera House. Raoul and Christine stared.

'What was that?' Raoul said, afraid. 'Was that...his voice ? Where did it come from?'

'I'm afraid, Raoul,' Christine whispered. 'I'm singing Margarita again on Saturday. What's going to happen?'

'This,' Raoul said. 'After the opera on Saturday night, you and I are going away together. Come on, let's go down now. I don't like it up here.'

They went carefully along a dark passage to some stairs, then suddenly stopped. There was a man in front of them, a tall man in a long dark coat and a black hat. He turned and looked at them.

'No, not these stairs,' he said. 'Go to the stairs at the front. And go quickly!'

Christine turned and ran. Raoul ran after her.

'Who was that man?' he asked.

'It's the Persian,' Christine answered.

'But who is he? What's his name? Why did he tell us to go to the front stairs?'

'Nobody knows his name. He's just the Persian. He's always in the Opera House. I think he knows about Erik, but he never talks about him. Perhaps he saw Erik on those stairs, and wanted to help us.'

Hand in hand, they ran quickly down the stairs, through passages, then more stairs and more passages. At one of the little back doors to the Opera House, they stopped.

'On Saturday night, then. After the opera,' Raoul said. 'I'm going to take you away, and marry you.'

Christine looked up into his face. 'Yes, Raoul.'

Then they kissed, there by the door of the Opera House. Their first kiss.

7 ．我的音乐天使

在一个星期的时间里拉乌尔天天都与克里斯廷约会。有时候克里斯廷显得沉默而不太高兴，而有时候她又笑又唱。她从不愿提及歌剧院，不愿提及她的演唱，也不愿提及拉乌尔对她的爱。拉乌尔为她感到非常担心。这个奇怪的老师，这个男人的声音，她的“音乐天使”到底是谁，或者是什么？

后来有一天克里斯廷不见了。她不在家里，不在歌剧院里，也不在他们约会的地方。拉乌尔到处找并且问遍了所有的人。克里斯廷·达埃在哪里？但是没有人知道。

在歌剧院重新开业的前两天，一封信送到了拉乌尔手里。它是克里斯廷写来的。

一个小时以后到歌剧院的顶层第11层来见我。

歌剧院的第11层是一个危险的地方。那里有数百条绳索垂向下面的舞台——长长地下垂着。

拉乌尔和克里斯廷坐在一个阴暗的角落里，拉乌尔握着克里斯廷的双手。她的脸色苍白，显得有些疲惫。

“听着，拉乌尔，”她轻声说，“我将把一切都告诉你。但是这是我们的最后一次约会。我再也不能见你了。”

“不，克里斯廷！”拉乌尔喊道，“我爱你，而且我们——”

“嘘！小声点！也许他能听到我们。在歌剧院里他无处不在，拉乌尔！”

“谁？你在说什么，克里斯廷？”

“我的音乐天使。上个星期六我不能来见你，因为他来找我，并且把我带走了。当时我正在歌剧院我的化妆室里，突然地，他就出现在我的面前！我第一次看到了发出这个声音的人！他穿着黑色晚礼服，脸上戴着面罩。他带着我穿过许多秘密的门和走廊，在歌剧院的底下一直往下走、往下走。那下面有一个湖，一个挺大的湖；湖水又黑又凉。他用小船带着我渡过那个湖去他的住处。他住在那里，拉乌尔，住在湖上的一座房子里，在歌剧院的底下！”

拉乌尔凝视着她。他美丽的克里斯廷疯了吗？克里斯廷看着他的脸，急急地说：

“这是真的，拉乌尔，这是真的！而他……他就是那个歌剧院的幽灵！不过他不是鬼，他也不是音乐天使，他是一个男人！他的名字叫埃里克，他爱我，他希望我成为他的妻子！不，拉乌尔，听着，还有。在他的房子里，在一个漂亮的房间里，他把这一切都告诉了我。他说没有一个女人会爱上他，都是因为他的脸。他是如此的不幸！接着他摘下面罩，我看到了他的脸。”

她开始哭了起来，拉乌尔一把将她抱住。

“哦！拉乌尔，他有一张最最可怕的脸！它是如此的丑陋！我真想尖叫着跑掉，可是我能往哪儿跑？他有一张死人一样的脸，拉乌尔，但是他并不是死人！他没有鼻子，在他黄色的脸上只有两个黑洞。还有他的眼睛！有时候它们是黑洞，有时候它们则发出可怕的红光……”

她把脸埋入双手之中，片刻之后她说：“我在他的房子里住了5天。他对我非常好，我觉得对不起他，拉乌尔。他希望我爱他，而我告诉他……我告诉他……”

“不，克里斯廷，不！你将成为我的妻子！来，马上和我离开这儿，就在今天！你不能回到他那儿去。”

“但是我必须，”克里斯廷轻声道，“他知道你，拉乌尔。他知道我们的事。他说他要杀了你。我必须回到他那儿去。”

“决不！”拉乌尔说，“我爱你，克里斯廷，而且我要杀了这个埃里克！”

埃里克……埃里克……埃里克……埃里克…… 这声音在歌剧院里低声回荡着。拉乌尔和克里斯廷面面相觑。

“那是什么？”拉乌尔害怕地说，“那是……他的声音吗？ 是从哪儿发出来的？”

“我害怕，拉乌尔，”克里斯廷轻声说，“星期六我将再次演唱玛格丽塔。到时候会发生什么事呢？”

“这样，”拉乌尔说，“演完星期六晚上的那场歌剧以后，你和我一起离开这儿。现在我们下去吧。我不喜欢待在这里。”

他们小心翼翼地沿着黑暗的走廊朝楼梯走去，接着突然停住了。有一个男人站在他们前面，这是一个高个子男人，穿着深色长外衣，戴着一顶黑色帽子。他转过身来看着他们。

“不，别走这楼梯，”他说，“去前面那楼梯，快走！”

克里斯廷转身就跑。拉乌尔跟着她跑。

“那个人是谁？”他问。

“是个波斯人。”克里斯廷回答。

“但是他是谁？他叫什么名字？为什么他告诉我们要走前面的楼梯？”

“没有人知道他的名字。他就是波斯人。他经常在歌剧院里。我想他知道埃里克，但是他从不提及他。或许他看到埃里克在那楼梯上，而想帮助我们。”

他们手拉着手飞快地跑下楼梯，穿过走廊，又走过更多的楼梯和走廊。在歌剧院的一个小小的后门口，他们停住了。

“那么星期六晚上，演完歌剧以后，”拉乌尔说，“我要带你离开这儿，并且和你结婚。”

克里斯廷抬头深情地看着他的脸。“好的，拉乌尔。”

随后他们接吻了，在歌剧院的那道门边。那是他们的初吻。

8Where is Christine Daaé?

Where is Christine Daaé?

On Saturday morning Comte Philippe looked across the breakfast table at his brother.

'Don' t do it, Raoul, please. All this talk about ghosts and phantoms. I think the girl is mad.'

'She's not mad, and I'm going to marry her,' Raoul said.

'She's only a little opera singer,' Philippe said unhappily. 'And she's very young. Are you still going to love her in ten, or twenty, years' time?'

Raoul drank his coffee and did not answer.

There were two more unhappy faces in the Opera House, too. The directors now understood about O. G. They didn't want any more accidents.

'Box 5 is free tonight for O. G. Daaé is singing Margarita. And here is 20,000 francs. Madame Giry can leave the money in Box 5 for him. Is that everything?' Monsieur Armand asked Monsieur Firmin.

'It's a lot of money,' Monsieur Firmin said unhappily. He thought for a minute. 'What about some flowers in Box 5? Madame Giry says that O. G. likes flowers.'

'O. G. can bring his own flowers!' shouted Monsieur Armand.

The evening began well. The chandelier was now back in place, with new ropes. All Paris was in the Opera House. Everybody wanted to hear Christine Daaé's voice again. People also knew about the love story between Christine Daaé and the Vicomte de Chagny. There are no love secrets in Paris! People watched the Comte and the Vicomte in Box 14 with interest. Young men from families like de Chagny do not marry opera singers.

When Christine came onto the stage, her face was white and she looked afraid. But she sang like an angel. Ah, what a voice! All Paris was in love with Christine Daaé.

She began to sing the famous love song. Suddenly, every light in the Opera House went out. For a second nobody moved or spoke. Then a woman screamed, and all the lights came on again.

But Christine Daaé was no longer on the stage! She was not behind the stage, she was not under the stage. Nobody could find her.

The Opera House went mad. Everybody ran here and there, shouted and called. In the directors' office, people ran in and out. The police came, and asked questions. But nobody could answer the questions. Monsieur Armand got angry and shouted, and Monsieur Firmin told him to be quiet. Then Madame Giry arrived in the office with her daughter Meg.

'Go away, woman!' Monsieur Armand shouted.

'Monsieur, there are three people missing now!' Madame Giry said. 'Meg, tell the directors your story.'

This was Meg's story.

'When the lights went out, we were just behind the stage. We heard a scream—I think it was Christine Daaé's voice. Then the lights came back on, but Christine wasn't there! We were very afraid, and we began to run back to our dressing room. There were people running everywhere! Then we saw the Vicomte de Chagny. His face was red and he was very angry. "Where's Christine? Where's Christine?" he shouted. Suddenly the Persian came up behind him and took his arm. He said something to the Vicomte and they went into Christine Daaé's dressing-room...'

'Yes? And then?' Monsieur Firmin said quickly. 'What happened next?'

'Nobody knows!' Meg's face was white. 'We looked into Christine Daaé's dressing-room, but... but there was nobody there!'

8 ．克里斯廷·达埃哪儿去了？

星期六早上菲利普伯爵望着早餐桌另一边的弟弟。

“请不要做这样的事，拉乌尔。这里所有人都在谈论鬼啊幽灵啊。我想那个姑娘疯了。”

“她没有疯，而且我要和她结婚。”拉乌尔说。

“她只是一个微不足道的歌剧演员，”菲利普不高兴地说，“而且她太年轻。10年或20年以后你还会爱她吗？”

拉乌尔喝着咖啡没有回答。

在歌剧院里也有两个闷闷不乐的人。经理们现在终于知道了O. G. 的厉害。他们不想再出现任何事故。

“五号包厢今晚空着留给O. G. 。由达埃来演唱玛格丽塔。另外这里是两万法郎。吉里夫人可以把这些钱留在五号包厢里给他。就这些了吧？”阿曼德先生问弗明先生。

“这是很多钱啊，”弗明先生不高兴地说。他想了一会儿，“在五号包厢里放些鲜花怎么样？吉里夫人说那个O. G. 喜欢鲜花。”

“O. G. 可以带上他自己的鲜花！”阿曼德先生喊道。

这个夜晚到来时，一切还是令人满意的。那枝形吊灯换了新的绳索又挂回了它原来的位置。巴黎所有的人都到了歌剧院。每个人都想再次欣赏克里斯廷·达埃的演唱。人们也都知道了克里斯廷·达埃和查格尼家族的子爵之间的爱情故事。在巴黎没有什么爱情秘密！人们饶有兴趣地朝14号包厢里的伯爵和子爵张望着。出身于像查格尼那样家族的年轻人是不会与歌剧演员结婚的。

当克里斯廷出现在舞台上的时候，她的脸色苍白而且看上去有些害怕。但是她唱得像一位天使。啊，多么美妙的声音！整个巴黎都爱上了克里斯廷·达埃。

她开始演唱那首著名的爱情歌曲。突然，歌剧院里所有的灯都熄灭了。这片刻之间没有人走动，也没有人说话。随后一个女人尖叫起来，与此同时所有的灯又都亮了。

但是克里斯廷却不再在舞台上了！她不在舞台的后面，她也不在舞台底下。没有人能够找到她。

歌剧院里乱得一团糟。每个人都跑来跑去，又喊又叫。在经理办公室里，人们跑进跑出。警察来了，问了一些问题。但是没有人能够回答这些问题。阿曼德先生发着脾气，喊叫着，弗明先生要他冷静一些。接着，吉里夫人领着她的女儿梅格走进了办公室。

“出去，小娘们！”阿尔曼先生喊道。

“先生，现在有三个人失踪了！”吉里夫人说，“梅格，把你看到的事告诉经理们。”

这是梅格的故事。

“当灯熄灭的时候，我们正在舞台的后面。我们听到一声尖叫——我觉得是克里斯廷·达埃的声音。随后灯又亮了，但是克里斯廷不见了！我们非常害怕，我们都开始往自己的化妆室跑。人们到处乱跑！接着我们看见了查格尼家族的子爵。他满脸通红而且显得非常愤怒。‘克里斯廷在哪里？克里斯廷在哪里？’他喊着。突然那个波斯人从他后面走过来抓住他的手臂，他对子爵说了些什么，然后他们就进了克里斯廷·达埃的化妆室……”

“是吗？那么后来呢？”弗明先生着急地问，“接下来发生了什么事？”

“没有人知道！”梅格脸色苍白，“我们朝克里斯廷·达埃的化妆室里面看了看，但是……但是那里并没有人！”

9The house on the lake

The house on the lake

When the lights came on, Raoul ran. He ran down stairs and along passages, through the Opera House to the back of the stage. In the passage outside Christine's dressing-room, a hand took his arm.

'What's the matter, my young friend? Where are you running to, so quickly?'

Raoul turned and saw the long face of the Persian under his black hat.

'Christine!' Raoul said quickly. 'Erik's got her. Where is she? Help me! How do I get to his house on the lake?'

'Come with me,' said the Persian. They went quickly into Christine's dressing-room. The Persian closed the door and went to the big mirror on one wall.

'There's only one door into this room,' Raoul began.

'Wait,' the Persian said. He put his hands on the big mirror, first here, then there. For a minute nothing happened. Then the mirror began to move and turn, and a big dark hole opened in it. Raoul stared.

'Quick! Come with me, but be careful,' the Persian said. 'I know Erik. I understand his secrets. Put your right hand up near your head, like this, and keep it there all the time.'

'But why?' Raoul asked.

'Remember Joseph Buquet, and the rope around his neck? Erik is a clever man with ropes in the dark.'

They went down, down, down, under the Opera House. They went through secret doors in the floors, then along passages and down dark stairs. The Persian listened carefully all the time for strange noises.

'When do we get to the lake?' Raoul whispered.

'We're not going by the lake. Erik watches it all the time. No, we go round the lake and get into Erik's house from the back. I know some secret doors.'

Soon they were there. In the dark, the Persian felt the wall carefully with his hands. 'Ah, here it is,' he whispered. The wall moved under his hands and a small door opened. Very quietly, they went through, and then the door closed behind them. They could not get out.

Inside the room it was very dark. They waited and listened. The Persian put his hands on the wall.

'Oh no!' he whispered. 'It was the wrong door! This is Erik's torture room—the room of mirrors! We are dead men, Vicomte de Chagny, dead men!'

At first Raoul did not understand. But he soon learnt. The lights came on, and they heard a man's laugh. Erik knew they were there.

The room was all mirrors—walls, floor, ceiling. There were pictures in the mirrors of trees and flowers and rivers. The pictures moved and danced in front of their eyes. And the room was hot. It got hotter and hotter and hotter. Raoul was thirsty, hot and thirsty, and the rivers in the pictures danced and laughed at him. He closed his eyes, but the rivers still danced. Water, he needed water, but the mirrors laughed at him. Soon he could not move or speak, or open his eyes. He was not thirsty now, just tired, so tired. 'Oh Christine, I'm sorry,' he thought. 'I wanted to help you, and now I'm dying...'

Through a mirror in the wall Christine watched her lover in the torture room. Behind her Erik stood, with his hands on her arms.

'He's dying, Christine, dying. Watch him carefully. No, don't close your eyes. Watch him!'

Christine could not speak. She wanted to scream, but no words came. Then she found her voice again.

'How can you do this, Erik! Why don't you kill me?'

'Because I love you, Christine. Marry me, be my wife, and love me. Then Raoul and the Persian can live.'

Slowly, Christine turned. She looked into Erik's terrible, ugly face, and spoke again, very quietly.

'Yes, Erik. From this minute I am your wife.' She put her arms around Erik's neck, and kissed him—kissed him slowly and lovingly on his ugly mouth. Then she took her arms away and said slowly, 'Poor, unhappy Erik.'

Erik stared at her. 'You kissed me!' he whispered. 'I didn't ask you, but you kissed me—freely! Oh Christine, my angel! That was my first kiss from a woman. Even my mother never kissed me! She gave me my first mask when I was two years old. She turned her face away from me every time I came near her.'

Erik put his ugly face in his hands and cried. Then he went down on the floor at Christine's feet. 'You are free, Christine, free! Go away and marry your Raoul, and be happy. But remember Erik, sometimes. Go now, quickly! Take Raoul and the Persian, and go!'

9 ．湖面上的房子

当灯亮起的时候，拉乌尔跑了。他跑下楼梯，沿着走廊，穿过歌剧院来到舞台的背后。在克里斯廷的化妆室门外的走廊上，一只手抓住了他的手臂。

“怎么了，我年轻的朋友？你跑得这么快要去哪儿？”

拉乌尔转过身来看到了黑色帽子下的那张波斯人的长脸。

“克里斯廷！”拉乌尔急急地说，“埃里克把她掳走了。她在哪里？帮帮我！我怎么去他湖上的房子？”

“跟我来。”波斯人说。他们飞快地进了克里斯廷的化妆室。波斯人把门关上，朝墙上的那面大镜子走去。

“进这个房间只有一扇门啊。”拉乌尔忍不住说。

“等一会儿，”波斯人说。他把手放在大镜子上，摸摸这儿，又摸摸那儿。过了一会儿并没有什么动静。接着镜子开始转动起来，里面出现了一个大的黑洞。拉乌尔目瞪口呆。

“快！跟我来，不过小心点儿，”波斯人说，“我了解埃里克。我知道他的秘密。把你的右手举起来靠近你的头，像这样，并且要一直保持那样。”

“这是为什么？”拉乌尔问。

“还记得约瑟夫·比凯和绕在他脖子上的绳子吗？埃里克是个聪明人，善于在黑暗中使用绳子。”

他们往歌剧院的底下走，往下，往下，一直往下。他们通过地板上的一层层密门，接着沿着走廊走下黑暗的楼梯。波斯人一直仔细倾听着有无异样的声音。

“我们什么时候才能到湖边？”拉乌尔轻声问。

“我们不从湖上走。埃里克一直在那儿看守着。不，我们绕过那湖从后面进入埃里克的房子。我知道一些秘密的门。”

不久他们到了那里。黑暗中，波斯人用手仔细地在墙上摸索。“啊，在这里。”他低声道。墙在他手下动起来，一扇小门打开了。他们脚步很轻地走进去，然后门在他们的身后关上了。他们不能出去了。

房间里很黑。他们等待着、倾听着。波斯人把手放到墙上。

“哦，不对！”他低声道，“我们走错了门！这是埃里克的拷问室——那个都是镜子的房间！我们成了死人了，查格尼家族的子爵，死人！”

一开始拉乌尔还没有明白是怎么回事，但是不久他就知道了。灯亮了，而且他们听到一个男人的笑声。埃里克知道他们在那里。

这个房间里全是镜子——墙、地板、天花板。镜子里有树、鲜花、河流的图画。这些图画在他们的眼前跳动着。而且房间里热烘烘的。它变得越来越热。拉乌尔觉得渴，又热又渴，而图画上的河流跳动着仿佛在嘲笑他。他闭上眼睛，但是河流依旧在晃动着。水，他需要水，但是镜子在嘲笑他。不久他就不能动不能说话，也不能睁眼了。他现在不觉得渴了，只觉得累，累极了。“哦！克里斯廷，对不起，”他想，“我想帮助你，而现在我快要死了……”

透过墙上的镜子克里斯廷看着在拷问室里的她的情人。她的身后站着埃里克，他的双手放在她的手臂上。

“他快要死了，克里斯廷，快要死了。仔细地看着他。不，不许闭上眼睛，看着他！”

克里斯廷说不出话来。她想尖叫，但发不出声音。接着她发现自己又能说话了。

“你怎么能这样做，埃里克！你为什么不杀了我？”

“因为我爱你，克里斯廷。和我结婚吧，做我的妻子，并且爱我。这样拉乌尔和波斯人就能活下来。”

慢慢地，克里斯廷转过身来。她看着埃里克那可怕、丑陋的脸，又一次开口说话了，非常温和地说。

“好的，埃里克。从这一刻起我就是你的妻子了。”她张开双臂搂住埃里克的脖子，并且吻了他——缓慢而充满爱意地吻了他那丑陋的嘴。随后她放下手臂缓缓地说：“可怜的不幸的埃里克。”

埃里克凝视着她。“你吻了我！”他轻声道，“我没有要求你，但是你吻了我——自愿地！哦，克里斯廷，我的天使！这是我从女人那儿得到的第一个吻。即便我的母亲也从来没有吻过我！我两岁的时候，她给了我第一个面罩。每次我走近她，她都把脸转开去。”

埃里克把他那丑陋的脸埋进双手哭了起来。随后他伏倒在克里斯廷的脚下。“你自由了，克里斯廷，自由了！去和你的拉乌尔结婚吧，祝你们幸福。不过有的时候不要忘记埃里克。现在就走吧，快！带上拉乌尔和波斯人，走吧！”

10Madame Giry visits the Persian

Madame Giry visits the Persian

For weeks, all Paris talked about that night at the opera. Everybody asked questions, but nobody knew the answers. Where was Christine Daaé? Where was the Vicomte de Chagny? Were they alive, or dead?

And the Phantom of the Opera... ?

Some weeks after that famous night Madame Giry went out one afternoon to a small house near the Rivoli Gardens. She went in and up the stairs to some rooms at the top of the house. The Persian opened the door.

Madame Giry looked at him. 'My friend, you know the answers. Please tell me. Are they alive or dead?'

'Come in,' the Persian said quietly.

They sat down on some chairs by the window, and looked out across the Rivoli Gardens.

'Yes,' the Persian said slowly, 'The Phantom is dead now. He did not want to live any longer. I saw his body three days ago, and because of that, I can talk to you about him. He cannot kill me now.'

'So the Phantom was really a man?' Madame Giry asked.

'Yes, his name was Erik. That was not his real name, of course. He was born in France, but I knew him in Persia. He was a famous builder and I worked with him there. For a time I was his friend, but not for long. When he came to Paris, I came after him—I wanted to watch him. He was a very clever, very dangerous man. He could be in two, or three, places at the same time. He could be in one place, and his voice could come from another place. He could do many clever things with ropes, and mirrors, and secret doors. You see, he helped to build the Opera House. He built secret passages underground, and his secret house on the lake. He could not live in the outside world, because of his terrible, ugly face. Unhappy Erik! We can feel sorry for him, Madame Giry. He was so clever... and so ugly. People screamed when they saw his face. And so he lived this strange life—half-man, half-phantom. But he was a man, in the end. He wanted a woman's love...'

He stopped, and Madame Giry asked quietly, 'And Christine Daaé and Vicomte Raoul? What happened to them?'

The Persian smiled. 'Ah yes! What happened to young Raoul and the beautiful Christine...? Who knows?'

Nobody in Paris ever saw Raoul and Christine again. Perhaps they took a train to the north, and lived a quiet, happy life together there. Perhaps Christine's wonderful voice is still singing, somewhere in the cold and beautiful mountains of Norway. Who knows?

10 ．吉里夫人拜访波斯人

几个星期以来，整个巴黎都在谈论歌剧院的那个夜晚。每个人都问这问那，但是没有人知道问题的答案。克里斯廷·达埃哪儿去了？查格尼家族的子爵哪儿去了？他们是活着，还是死了？

还有那歌剧院的幽灵……？

在那个出名的夜晚过去几个星期以后的一天下午，吉里夫人出门去了里沃利花园附近的一座小房子。她进门上了楼梯来到房子顶层的几个房间前，波斯人打开了房门。

吉里夫人看着他。“我的朋友，你知道结果。请告诉我，他们是活着还是死了？”

“进来。”波斯人轻声说。

他们在靠近窗口的椅子上坐下，看着窗外的里沃利花园。

“是的，”波斯人缓缓地说，“那个幽灵现在已经死了。他不想再活下去了。我三天前见到了他的尸体，正因为如此，我才可以告诉你他的事。他现在不能杀我了。”

“那么那个幽灵真的是一个男人吗？”吉里夫人问。

“对，他的名字叫埃里克。当然，那不是他的真名。他出生在法国，不过我是在波斯认识他的。他是一位著名的建筑师，我在那儿跟他工作。我一度是他的朋友，但是并不长久。当他来巴黎时，我跟随他来了——我想监视他。他是一个非常聪明、非常危险的人物。他能够同时在两个或三个地方出现。他能够做到身在一个地方，而他的声音来自另一个地方。他能利用绳子、镜子和秘密的门做许多巧妙的事情。你看，他帮助建造了歌剧院。他建造了地下秘密通道和他的湖上秘密居所。他不能生活在外面的世界，因为他的可怕、丑陋的脸。不幸的埃里克！我们可以为他感到难过，吉里夫人。他是如此聪明……而又如此丑陋。人们看到他的脸就尖叫起来。所以他过着这种怪异的生活——半人半鬼。但是他终究是个男人。他需要女人的爱……”

他话一停，吉里夫人轻声问：“那克里斯廷·达埃和拉乌尔子爵呢？他们怎么样了？”

波斯人微笑着。“啊，对了！年轻的拉乌尔和美丽的克里斯廷怎么样了……？谁知道呢？”

巴黎没有人再见过拉乌尔和克里斯廷。也许他们坐上了北去的火车，在那里一起过着平静、快乐的生活。也许克里斯廷那美妙的歌喉依然在歌唱，在挪威寒冷而美丽的山里的某个地方。谁知道呢？

你可以许三个愿，你可以要世界上存在的三样东西，你的愿望将变为现实。你会说，“这在现实世界是不可能发生的。”那么，好好想想吧。你能要什么？你想要什么？

当你许愿的时候，这仅仅是个开始。当你改变了一样东西，接着你会改变世界上的每一样东西。一个变化引起另一个变化。谁又能知道这些变化又将在哪里结束？

在这个故事中，怀特一家可以许三个愿，但他们犯了一个小小的错误。他们的第一个愿望变成了现实。接着，顷刻间，他们的生活陷入了一场可怕的恶梦……

雅各布斯（1863—1943）是一位短篇小说作家。《猴爪》是他的最有名的小说之一。

Chapter 1

It was cold and dark out in the road and the rain did not stop for a minute. But in the little living-room of number 12 Castle Road it was nice and warm. Old Mr White and his son, Herbert, played chess and Mrs White sat and watched them. The old woman was happy because her husband and her son were good friends and they liked to be together. 'Herbert's a good son,' she thought. 'We waited a long time for him and I was nearly forty when he was born, but we are a happy family.' And old Mrs White smiled.

It was true. Herbert was young and he laughed a lot, but his mother and his father laughed with him. They had not got much money, but they were a very happy little family.

The two men did not talk because they played carefully. The room was quiet, but the noise of the rain was worse now and they could hear it on the windows. Suddenly Old Mr White looked up. 'Listen to the rain!' he said.

'Yes, it's a bad night,' Herbert answered. 'It's not a good night to be out. But is your friend, Tom Morris, coming tonight? '

'Yes, that's right. He's coming at about seven o'clock,' the old man said. 'But perhaps this rain...'

Mr White did not finish because just then the young man heard a noise.

'Listen!' Herbert said. 'There's someone at the door now.'

'I didn't hear a noise,' his father answered, but he got up from his chair and went to open the front door. Mrs White got up too and began to put things away.

Mr White said, 'Come in, come in, Tom. It's wonderful to see you again. What a bad night! Give me your coat and then come into the living-room. It's nice and warm in there.'

The front door was open, and in the living-room Mrs White and Herbert felt the cold. Then Mr White came back into the living-room with a big, red-faced man.

'This is Tom Morris,' Mr White told his wife and son. 'We were friends when we were young. We worked together before Tom went to India. Tom, this is my wife and this is our son, Herbert.'

'Pleased to meet you,' Tom Morris said.

'Pleased to meet you, Mr Morris,' Mrs White answered. 'Please come and sit down.'

'Yes, come on, Tom,' Mr White said. 'Over here. It's nice and warm.'

'Thank you,' the big man answered and he sat down.

'Let's have some whisky,' Old Mr White said. 'You need something to warm you on a cold night.' He got out a bottle of whisky and the two old friends began to drink and talk. The little family listened with interest to this visitor from far away and he told them many strange stories.

外面的马路上又冷又黑，雨一直下个不停。但城堡路12号的一间小客厅里却蛮暖和。老怀特先生和他的儿子赫伯特在下象棋，怀特太太坐在一旁看着他们。老妇人因她的丈夫和儿子是好朋友并乐于在一起而高兴。“赫伯特是一个好孩子，我们等了很长时间才要到的孩子，他出生的时候我都快40岁了，但我们的家庭很幸福。”老怀特太太想着、想着，脸上露出了笑容。

这是事实，赫伯特年轻又爱笑，他的母亲和父亲也总跟着乐。他们并没有很多钱，但他们有一个非常幸福的小家庭。

两个男人无言地下着棋。房间里很安静，但雨声现在更大了，他们能听到雨点打在窗上的声音。突然，老怀特先生抬起头说：“听听雨声！”

“是的，这是一个糟糕的夜晚，”赫伯特答道，“这样的夜晚不宜外出，但你的朋友汤姆·莫里斯今晚不是要来吗？”

“是的，你说得对。他将在7点钟左右到，但也许这雨……”老汉说。

怀特先生没有说下去，因为就在这时，年轻人听到了一种声音。

“听！”赫伯特说，“现在门外有人。”

他的父亲答道：“我没有听到声音。”但他还是从椅子上起来去开门，怀特太太也站起来开始收拾东西。

怀特先生说：“汤姆，快请进，快请进。又见到你真高兴。多么糟糕的夜晚！把外套给我，到客厅里去，那儿暖和。”

前门打开了，客厅里的怀特太太和赫伯特感觉到一阵寒气。怀特先生领着一位高大的红脸汉子回到了起居室。

“这是汤姆·莫里斯，”怀特先生告诉他的太太和儿子，“我们年轻的时候是好朋友，在汤姆去印度之前我们在一起工作过。汤姆，这是我太太，这是我们的儿子，赫伯特。”

“很高兴见到你们。”汤姆·莫里斯说。

“我们也很高兴见到你，莫里斯先生。”怀特太太答道，“请过来坐下吧。”

“对，过来，汤姆，到这儿来，这儿舒服暖和一点。”怀特先生说。

“谢谢你。”高大的汉子答应着坐下了。

“我们喝一点威士忌吧，”老怀特先生说，“这样寒冷的夜晚，你需要一点东西暖和暖和身子。”他拿出一瓶威士忌，两位老朋友边喝边谈。这个小家庭饶有兴趣地倾听着这位来自远方的造访者告诉他们许多离奇的故事。

Chapter 2

After some time Tom Morris stopped talking and Mr White said to his wife and son, 'Tom was a soldier in India for twenty-one years. India is a wonderful country.'

'Yes,' Herbert said. 'I'd like to go there.'

'Oh, Herbert!' his mother cried. She was afraid because she did not want to lose her son.

'I wanted to go to India too,' her husband said, 'but...'

'It's better for you here!' the soldier said quickly.

'But you saw a lot of strange and wonderful things in India. I want to see them too one day,' Mr White said.

The soldier put down his whisky. 'No!' he cried. 'Stay here!'

Old Mr White did not stop. 'But your stories were interesting,' he said to Tom Morris. 'What did you begin to say about a monkey's paw?'

'Nothing!' Morris answered quickly. 'Well... nothing important.'

'A monkey's paw?' Mrs White said.

'Come on, Mr Morris! Tell us about it,' Herbert said.

Morris took his whisky in his hand, but suddenly he put it down again. Slowly he put his hand into the pocket of his coat and the White family watched him.

'What is it? What is it?' Mrs White cried.

Morris said nothing. He took his hand out of his pocket. The White family watched carefully—and in the soldier's hand they saw something little and dirty.

Mrs White moved back, afraid, but her son, Herbert, took it and looked at it carefully.

'Well, what is it?' Mr White asked his friend.

'Look at it,' the soldier answered. 'It's a little paw... a monkey's paw.'

'A monkey's paw!' Herbert said—and he laughed. 'Why do you carry a monkey's paw in your pocket, Mr Morris?' he asked the old soldier.

'Well, you see,' Morris said, 'this monkey's paw is magic!'

Herbert laughed again, but the soldier said, 'Don't laugh, boy. Remember, you're young. I'm old now and in India I saw many strange things.' He stopped talking for a minute and then he said, 'This monkey's paw can do strange and wonderful things. An old Indian gave the paw to one of my friends. My friend was a soldier too. This paw is magic because it can give three wishes to three people.'

'Wonderful!' Herbert said.

'But these three wishes don't bring happiness,' the soldier said. 'The old Indian wanted to teach us something—it's never good to want to change things.'

'Well, did your friend have three wishes?' Herbert asked the old soldier.

'Yes,' Morris answered quietly. 'And his third and last wish was to die!'

Mr and Mrs White listened to the story and they felt afraid, but Herbert asked, 'And did he die?'

'Yes, he did,' Morris said. 'He had no family, so his things came to me when he died. The monkey's paw was with his things, but he told me about it before he died,' Tom Morris finished quietly.

'What were his first two wishes, then?' Herbert asked. 'What did he ask for?'

'I don't know. He didn't want to tell me,' the soldier answered.

For a minute or two everybody was quiet, but then Herbert said, 'And you, Mr Morris: did you have three wishes?'

'Yes, I did,' Morris answered. 'I was young. I wanted many things—a fast car, money...' Morris stopped for a minute and then he said with difficulty, 'My wife and my young son died in an accident in the car. Without them I didn't want the money, so, in the end, I wished to lose it. But it was too late. My wife and my child were dead.'

The room was very quiet. The White family looked at the unhappy face of the old soldier.

Then Mr White said, 'Why do you want the paw now? You don't need it. You can give it to someone.'

'How can I give it to someone?' the soldier said. 'The monkey's paw brings unhappiness with it.'

'Well, give it to me,' Mr White said. 'Perhaps this time it...'

'No!' Tom Morris cried. 'You're my friend. I can't give it to you.' Then, after a minute, he said, 'I can't give it to you, but, of course you can take it from me. But remember—this monkey's paw brings unhappiness!'

Old Mr White did not listen and he did not think. Quickly, he put out his hand, and he took the paw.

Tom Morris looked unhappy, but Mr White did not want to wait.

'What do I do now?' he asked his friend.

'Yes, come on, Father,' Herbert said. 'Make a wish!' And he laughed.

The soldier said nothing and Mr White asked him again, 'What do I do now?'

At first the old soldier did not answer, but in the end he said quietly, 'OK. But remember! Be careful! Think before you make your wish.'

' Yes, yes,' Mr White said.

'Take the paw in your right hand and then make your wish, but...' Tom Morris began.

'Yes, we know,' Herbert said. 'Be careful!'

Just then old Mrs White stood up and she began to get the dinner. Her husband looked at her. Then he smiled and said to her, 'Come on. Help me! What can I wish for? We need money, of course.'

Mrs White laughed, but she thought for a minute and then she said, 'Well, I'm getting old now and sometimes it's difficult to do everything. Perhaps I need four hands and not two. Yes, ask the paw to give me two more hands.'

'OK, then,' her husband said, and he took the monkey's paw in his right hand. Everybody watched him and for a minute he waited. Then he opened his mouth to make his wish.

Suddenly Tom Morris stood up. 'Don't do it!' he cried.

The old soldier's face was white. Herbert and his mother laughed, but Mr White looked at Tom's face.

Old Mr White was afraid and he put the monkey's paw into his pocket.

After a minute or two they sat down at the table and began to have dinner. The soldier told the family many strange and wonderful stories about India. They forgot the monkey's paw, and because the soldier's stories were interesting, they asked him many questions about India. When Tom Morris stood up to leave, it was very late.

'Thank you for a very nice evening,' Morris said to the family. 'And thank you for a very good dinner,' he said to Mrs White.

'It was a wonderful evening for us, Tom,' Old Mr White answered. 'Your stories were very interesting. Our life isn't very exciting and we don't have the money to visit India, so please come again soon. You can tell us some more stories about India.'

Then the old soldier put on his coat. He said goodbye to the White family, and went out into the rain.

不知过了多长时间，汤姆·莫里斯停止了交谈。怀特先生告诉他太太和儿子：“汤姆到印度服兵役有21年了。印度是一个非常有趣的国家。”

“是的，”赫伯特说，“我想去那儿。”

“哦，赫伯特！”他母亲惊叫起来。她非常害怕，因为她不想失去儿子。

“我也想去印度，”她的丈夫说，“不过……”

“对你来说，这儿很不错！”老兵很快地说。

“你在印度看到了那么多奇怪又有趣的东西，我想有一天也能去看看。”怀特先生说。

老兵放下威士忌。“不！”他嚷道，“待在这儿！”

老怀特先生并没有停下，“你的故事很有趣，”他对汤姆·莫里斯说，“关于猴爪的事你想告诉我们什么？”

“没什么！”莫里斯很快地回答，“真的……无关紧要。”

“猴爪？”怀特太太惊问。

“继续给我们讲讲吧，莫里斯先生。”赫伯特说。

莫里斯用手拿起他的威士忌，但突然又把它放下，然后慢慢地把手伸进他的外套口袋。怀特一家看着他。

“那是什么东西？那是什么东西？”怀特太太叫道。

莫里斯什么也没说，他把手拿出口袋。怀特一家仔细地看着——在老兵手里他们看到了一个又小又脏的东西。

怀特太太害怕地缩了回来，但她的儿子赫伯特却把那东西拿过来仔细地看。

“喂，那是什么？”怀特先生问他的朋友。

“看看吧，”老兵答道，“它是一只小爪子啊……一只猴子的爪子。”

“一只猴子的爪子！”赫伯特说着大笑起来。“为什么你在口袋里带着猴爪，莫里斯先生？”他问老兵。

“你要明白，这个猴爪是有魔力的！”莫里斯说。

赫伯特又笑了，但老兵认真地说：“孩子，别笑了，记住，你还年轻，可我现在老啦，我曾在印度见到了很多奇怪的事情。”他停了一会儿，接着说，“这个猴爪能做奇怪而又奇妙的事情，一个印度老人把这个猴爪给了我的一位朋友，我的朋友也是一个当兵的。这猴爪有魔力是因为它能满足三个人每人提出的三个愿望。”

“太妙了！”赫伯特说。

“但这三个愿望并不能带来幸福。”老兵提醒说，“印度老人想告诉我们——想改变现实并不一定是好事。”

“那么，你的朋友也有三个愿望吗？”赫伯特问老兵。

“是的，”莫里斯静静地回答，“并且他的第三个也是最后一个愿望就是去死！”

怀特先生和怀特太太听了这个故事感到有些害怕，赫伯特问：“他死了吗？”

“是的，他死了，”莫里斯说，“他没有家，所以他死的时候把他的东西全给了我，猴爪是这些东西的附带品，不过他死之前就告诉过我有关猴爪的故事。”汤姆·莫里斯静静地说。

“那么，他的头两个愿望是什么？”赫伯特追问，“他要求什么？”

“我不知道，他不想告诉我。”老兵回答说。

一两分钟里大家都沉默着，然而赫伯特又问，“莫里斯先生，你有三个愿望吗？”

“是的，我有过，”莫里斯问答说，“我年轻时，我想要很多东西——一辆跑车，还有钱……”莫里斯顿了一会儿，然后很艰难地说，“我的妻子和我年轻的儿子在一次车祸中丧生，没有了他们我不再想要钱，以至到最后，我希望一无所有，但为时已晚，我的妻子和孩子并不能死而复生。”

房子里很静，怀特一家看着老兵苦楚的脸。

接着，怀特先生问，“为什么你现在还要这个爪子呢？你不需要它，你可以把它送给别人。”

“我怎么能送给别人呢？”老兵说，“猴爪会给拥有它的人带来痛苦。”

“那么，给我吧，”怀特先生说，“也许这次它……”

“不！”汤姆·莫里斯叫道，“你是我的朋友，我不能把它给你。”过了一会儿，他说，“我不能把它给你，但你可以从我身边把它拿走，不过要记住——猴爪会给你带来痛苦！”

老怀特没有听进去也没有仔细想，很快地伸出手拿走了猴爪。

汤姆·莫里斯看起来不高兴，但怀特先生等不及了。

“我现在能做什么？”他问他的朋友。

“对，这样吧，父亲，”赫伯特说，“许个愿吧！”赫伯特笑了。

老兵什么也不说，怀特先生又问他，“我现在能做些什么呢？”

开始，老兵什么也不回答，最后他静静地说，“好吧，但记住要小心，在你许愿之前要考虑好。”

“行，行。”怀特先生说。

“用右手拿着猴爪，然后许愿，但是……”汤姆·莫里斯又开始了他那一套。

“行了，我们知道。”赫伯特说，“要小心！”

这时怀特太太站起来去做晚饭。她的丈夫看着她，并笑着对她说：“过来帮帮我，我能许一个什么愿呢？当然，我们需要钱。”

怀特太太笑了起来，她想了一会儿说，“是的，我开始变老啦，有时做事情很吃力。可能我需要四只手而不是两只手，那么好吧，让猴爪多给我两只手。”

“好吧。”她的丈夫说，他把猴爪放在右手中。每个人都看着他，他等了一会儿然后张开嘴开始许愿。

突然，汤姆·莫里斯站起来。“不要这样！”他喊道。

老兵的脸变白了。赫伯特和他的母亲笑了起来，但怀特先生却看着汤姆的脸。

老怀特先生害怕了，他把猴爪放进了口袋。

一两分钟后，他们坐在桌旁开始吃晚饭。老兵告诉这一家许多有关印度的新奇的故事。他们暂时忘了猴爪，因为老兵的故事很有趣，他们问了他许多有关印度的问题。当汤姆·莫里斯起来要走时，天色已经很晚了。

“感谢有这么一个美好的夜晚，”莫里斯对这一家人道谢，“感谢有这样一顿美好的晚餐，”他对怀特太太说。

“汤姆，对我们来说这也是一个美好的夜晚，”老怀特先生回答道，“你的故事很有趣。我们的生活很平淡，我们没有钱去印度，所以请你尽快再来，你可以告诉我们更多关于印度的故事。”

接着老兵穿上衣服，和怀特一家道别后，他就消失在雨中。

Chapter 3

It was nearly midnight. In their warm living-room, the two old people and their son sat and talked about the soldier's stories.

'India is a wonderful country,' Mr White said. 'What exciting stories! It was a good evening.'

Mrs White stood up to take some things into the kitchen, but she stopped and listened to Herbert and his father.

'Yes,' Herbert said. 'Morris told some interesting stories, but, of course, some of them weren't true.'

'Oh Herbert!' Mrs White said.

'Well, Mother, that story about the monkey's paw wasn't true. A dirty little monkey's paw isn't magic! But it was a good story. ' And Herbert smiled.

'Well, I think you're right, Herbert,' his mother said.

'I don't know,' Mr White said quietly. 'Perhaps the story was true. Strange things can happen sometimes.'

Mrs White looked at her husband. 'Did you give some money to Tom Morris for that paw?' she asked. 'We don't have money to give away for nothing!' Mrs White was angry now.

'Well, yes,' her husband answered. 'I did, but not much, and at first he didn't want to take it. He wanted the monkey's paw.'

'Well, he can't have it,' Herbert laughed. 'It's our paw now and we're going to be rich and happy. Come on, Father. Make a wish!'

Old Mr White took the paw from his pocket. 'OK, Herbert, but what am I going to ask for? I have everything—you, your mother. What do I need?'

'Money, of course,' Herbert answered quickly. 'We need money! You're always thinking about money. That's because we haven't got very much of it. With money you can pay for this house. It can be your house! Go on, Father, wish for thirty thousand pounds!'

Herbert stopped talking and his old father thought for a minute. The room was quiet and they could hear the rain on the windows.

Then Mr White took the monkey's paw in his right hand. He was afraid, but he looked at his wife and she smiled at him.

'Go on,' she said.

Slowly and carefully Mr White said, 'I wish for thirty thousand pounds.'

Suddenly he gave a cry and Mrs White and Herbert ran to him.

'What's the matter, Father?' Herbert asked.

'It moved!' Mr White cried. 'The monkey's paw—it moved!'

They looked at the paw. It was now on the floor and not in the old man's hand. The family watched it, and they waited—but it did not move again.

So the little family sat down again and they waited. Nothing happened. The noise of the rain on the windows was worse now and their little living-room did not feel nice and warm.

Mrs White said, 'It's cold. Let's go to bed.'

Mr White did not answer and in the end Herbert said, 'Well, there's no money, Father. Your friend's story wasn't true.' But Mr White did not answer. He sat quietly and said nothing.

After some time Mrs White said to her husband, 'Are you OK?'

'Yes, yes,' the old man answered, 'but for a minute or two I was afraid.'

'Well, we needed that money,' Mrs White said, 'but we aren't going to get it. I'm tired. I'm going to bed.'

After Mrs White went to bed, the two men sat and smoked for some time.

Then Herbert said, 'Well, Father, I'm going to bed too. Perhaps the money is in a bag under your bed! Good night, Father.' And Herbert laughed and went out of the room.

Old Mr White sat in the cold living-room for a long time. The candle died and it was dark. Suddenly, the old man saw a face at the window. Quickly, he looked again, but there was nothing there. He felt afraid. Slowly he stood up and left the cold, dark room.

已经快半夜了。在他们温暖的客厅里，两位老人和他们的儿子在谈论着老兵的故事。

“印度是一个神奇的国家，”怀特先生说，“多么激动人心的故事！多么美好的夜晚。”

怀特太太站起来要拿东西进厨房，但她却停下来听赫伯特和他父亲谈话。

“是的，”赫伯特说，“莫里斯讲了一些有趣的故事，但是，有些东西不一定是真实的。”

“哦，赫伯特！”怀特太太说。

“是的，母亲，有关猴爪的故事不是真的。一只脏的小猴爪哪会有魔力！但这个故事很好。”赫伯特笑着说。

“嗯，我想你是对的，赫伯特。”他母亲说。

“我不知道，”怀特先生平静地说，“也许这个故事是真的。怪事有时也会发生。”

怀特太太看着她的丈夫。“你从汤姆·莫里斯那儿拿来猴爪给他钱了吗？”她问。“我们没有钱去为无价值的东西付出！”怀特太太现在发怒了。

“是的，”她丈夫回答说，“我付钱了，但不多。开始他不想要钱，他要他的猴爪。”

“好啦，莫里斯不再拥有猴爪了，”赫伯特笑了起来。“猴爪现在属于我们，我们将变得富有幸福。来吧，父亲。许个愿！”

老怀特先生从口袋里拿出猴爪。“好吧，赫伯特，但我还要什么呢？我拥有一切——你，你母亲。我需要什么呢？”

“当然是钱，”赫伯特迅速回答，“我们需要钱！你总是为钱而费尽心思，那是因为我们没有多少钱。有钱你能买房子。真正属于你的房子！来吧，父亲，许愿吧，愿咱们有30,000英镑！”

赫伯特停止了讲话，他的老父亲思考了一会儿。房子里很安静，他们能够听到雨点打在窗户上的声音。

接着怀特先生拿出猴爪放在右手中。他很害怕，他看着妻子；他的妻子冲他微笑。

“说吧。”她说。

怀特先生缓慢而又小心地说：“我希望有30,000英镑。”

突然，他发出一声尖叫，怀特太太和赫伯特向他跑过去。

“发生什么事了，父亲？”赫伯特问。

“它动起来了！”怀特先生喊道。“那猴爪——它动起来了！”

他们看着爪子。爪子现在不在老人手里而在地板上。这一家看着，等着，但猴爪已不再动了。

于是，这个小家庭又坐下来等。但什么也没有发生。雨声现在变得更急，他们的小客厅已感觉不到舒适暖和了。

怀特太太说：“天冷了，我们睡觉吧。”

怀特先生不答话，最后赫伯特说：“瞧，没有钱出现，父亲，你朋友讲的故事不是真的。”但怀特先生还是不答话，他静静地坐着一言不发。

一会儿过后，怀特太太问她丈夫：“你没事吧？”

“是的，是的，”老人回答道，“但有一两分钟我很害怕。”

“不错，我们需要钱，”怀特太太说，“但我们不会凭空拿到钱。我累了，我要睡觉。”

怀特太太上床睡觉之后，两个男人坐着吸了一会儿烟。

赫伯特说：“父亲，我也要睡觉了。也许钱就在你床下的一个袋子里！晚安，父亲。”赫伯特笑着走出了房间。

老怀特先生在寒冷的客厅里坐了很长时间。蜡烛灭了，屋里黑了。突然，老人看见窗户上有一张脸。很快，他又看了一眼，但那儿什么也没有。他很害怕，他慢慢地站起来，离开了寒冷、漆黑的房间。

Chapter 4

The next morning the winter sun came through the window and the house felt nice and warm again. Mr White felt better and he smiled at his wife and son. The family sat down to have breakfast and they began to talk about the day. The monkey's paw was on a little table near the window, but nobody looked at it and nobody thought about it.

'I'm going to the shops this morning,' Mrs White said. 'I want to get something nice for dinner. Are you going to come with me?' she asked her husband.

'No, I'm going to have a quiet morning. I'm going to read,' her husband answered.

'Well, I'm not going to go out this evening,' Herbert said, 'so we can go to bed early tonight. We were very late last night.'

'And we aren't going to have stories about monkey's paws!' Mrs White said. She was angry. 'Why did we listen to your friend?' she asked her husband. 'A monkey's paw can't give you things!' She stopped but the two men did not answer her. 'Thirty thousand pounds!' she said quietly. 'We needed that money.'

Just then Herbert looked at the clock and stood up. 'I'm going to work,' he said. 'Perhaps the postman has got the money for you in a letter. Remember, I want some of it too!' Herbert laughed and his mother laughed too.

'Don't laugh, son,' Mr White said. 'Tom Morris is an old friend and he thinks the story is true. Perhaps it is.'

'Well, leave some of the money for me,' Herbert laughed again.

His mother laughed too and she went to the door with him.

'Goodbye, Mother,' Herbert said happily. 'Get something nice for dinner this evening at the shops. I'm always hungry after a day at work.'

'I know you are!' Mrs White answered.

Herbert left the house and walked quickly down the road. His mother stood at the door for some time and watched him. The winter sun was warm, but suddenly she felt very cold.

第二天早晨，冬日的阳光穿过窗户，房子里重新变得舒适温暖。怀特先生感觉好些了，他对着妻子和儿子微笑。一家子坐下来共进早餐，他们讨论着白天要干的事。猴爪放在窗子边的小桌上，但没有人去看它，也没有人想到它。

“上午我想去商店，”怀特太太说，“我想买一点好东西做晚餐，你愿意和我一块去吗？”她问丈夫。

“不，我想享受一个安静的上午。我想看书。”她丈夫回答说。

“今天晚上我不想出门，”赫伯特说，“我们就能早一点上床睡觉，昨晚我们睡得太迟了。”

“我们再也不会听有关猴爪的故事！”怀特太太说。她发火了。“为什么我们要相信你的朋友？”她问丈夫，“一个猴爪不会给你任何东西的！”她停了下来，但两个男人并没有回答她。“30,000英磅！”她平静地说，“我们需要那些钱。”

就在这时，赫伯特看看时间并站了起来。“我要去工作了，”他说，“也许邮差在一封信里把钱寄给你，记住，我也想要一些！”赫伯特笑了，她母亲也笑了。

“别笑了，孩子，”怀特先生说，“汤姆·莫里斯是我的老朋友了，既然他认为这个故事是真实的，也许就是真的。”

“好吧，给我也留下一些钱，”赫伯特又笑了起来。

他母亲也笑了起来并起身送儿子出门。

“再见，妈妈。”赫伯特高兴地说，“到商店买点好吃的东西做晚餐，工作一天后我总觉得饿。”

“我知道！”怀特太太答道。

赫伯特离开了家，沿着马路快步地走。他母亲站在门边目送他远去。冬日的阳光很暖和，但怀特太太却突然觉得冷极了。

Chapter 5

Slowly, Old Mrs White went back into the house. Her husband looked up and saw something strange in her face.

'What's the matter?' he asked.

'Nothing,' his wife answered, and she sat down to finish her breakfast. She began to think about Tom Morris again and suddenly she said to her husband, 'Your friend drank a lot of whisky last night! A monkey's paw! What a story!'

Mr White did not answer her because just then the postman arrived. He brought two letters for them—but there was no money in them. After breakfast the two old people forgot about the money and the monkey's paw.

Later in the day, at about one o'clock, Mr and Mrs White sat down to eat and then they began to talk about money again. They did not have very much money, so they often needed to talk about it.

'That thirty thousand pounds,' Mrs White said, 'we need it!'

'But it didn't come this morning,' her husband answered. 'Let's forget it!'

Then he said, 'But that thing moved. The monkey's paw moved in my hand! Tom's story was true!'

'You drank a lot of whisky last night. Perhaps the paw didn't move,' Mrs White answered.

'It moved!' Mr White cried angrily.

At first his wife did not answer, but then she said, 'Well, Herbert laughed about it...'

Suddenly she stopped talking. She stood up and went over to the window.

'What's the matter?' her husband asked.

'There's a man in front of our house,' Mrs White answered. 'He's a stranger—very tall—and well-dressed. He's looking at our house... Oh, no... it's OK... He's going away...'

'Come and sit down! Finish eating!' Mr White said.

The old woman did not listen to her husband. 'He isn't going away,' she went on. 'He's coming back. I don't know him—he's a stranger. Yes, he's very well-dressed...' Suddenly Mrs White stopped. She was very excited. 'He's coming to the door... Perhaps he's bringing the money!'

And she ran out of the room to open the front door.

The tall, well-dressed stranger stood there. For a minute he said nothing, but then he began, 'Good afternoon. I'm looking for Mr and Mrs White.'

'Well, I'm Mrs White,' the old woman answered. 'What can I do for you?'

At first the stranger did not answer, but then he said, 'Mrs White, I'm from Maw and Meggins. Can I come in and talk to you?'

Maw and Meggins had a big factory and Herbert White worked there on the machinery.

'Yes, of course,' Mrs White answered. 'Please come in.'

The well-dressed stranger came into the little living-room and Mr White stood up.

'Are you Mr White?' the stranger began. Then he went on, 'I'm from Maw and Meggins.'

Mrs White looked at the stranger and she thought, 'Perhaps he has the money... but why Maw and Meggins? And his face is very unhappy... Why?' Suddenly the old woman was afraid.

'Please sit down,' Mr White began, but now his wife could not wait.

'What's the matter?' she cried. 'Is Herbert...' She could not finish the question.

The stranger did not look at their faces—and Mr White began to be afraid too.

'Please, tell us!' he said.

'I'm very sorry,' the man from Maw and Meggins began. He stopped for a minute and then he began again. 'I'm very sorry, but this morning there was an accident at the factory...'

'What's the matter? Is Herbert OK?' Mrs White cried again.

'Well...' the man began slowly.

'Is he in hospital?' the old woman asked, very afraid now.

'Yes, but...' the stranger looked at Mrs White's face and stopped.

'Is he dead? Is Herbert dead?' Mr White asked quietly.

'Dead!' Mrs White cried. 'Oh no... please... not dead! Not Herbert! Not our son!'

Suddenly the old woman stopped because she saw the stranger's face. Then the two old people knew. Their son was dead! Old Mrs White began to cry quietly and Mr White put his arm round her.

Some time later the man from Maw and Meggins said, 'It was the machinery—an accident. Herbert called, "Help!". The men heard him—and ran to him quickly, but they could do nothing. The next minute he was in the machinery. I'm very, very sorry,' he finished.

For a minute or two the room was quiet. At last Mrs White said, 'Our son! Dead! We're never going to see him again. What are we going to do without him?'

Her husband said, 'He was our son. We loved him.'

Then Mrs White asked the stranger, 'Can we see him? Can we see our son? Please take me to him. I want to see my son.'

But the stranger answered quickly, 'No!' he said. 'It's better not to see him. They couldn't stop the machinery quickly. He was in there for a long time. And at first they couldn't get him out. He was...' The man stopped. Then he said, 'Don't go to see him!'

The stranger went over to the window because he did not want to see the faces of the two old people. He said nothing, but he stood there for some time and he waited.

Then he went back to the old people and began to talk again. 'There's one more thing,' he said. 'Your son worked for Maw and Meggins for six years and he was a good worker. Now Maw and Meggins want to help you at this unhappy time.' Again the stranger stopped. After a minute he began again. 'Maw and Meggins want to give you some money.' Then he put something into Mr White's hand.

Old Mr White did not look at the money in his hand. Slowly he stood up and looked at the stranger, afraid. 'How much?' Mr White asked, very quietly. He did not want to hear the answer.

'Thirty thousand pounds,' the stranger said.

慢慢地，年迈的怀特太太又回到了屋里。她的丈夫打量着她，瞧见她脸上有一种奇怪的表情。

“怎么啦？”他问。

“没事儿，”妻子说着就坐下来继续吃她的早餐。她又开始想汤姆·莫里斯的事。突然，她对丈夫说，“昨天晚上你的朋友喝了太多的威士忌！讲了神奇的猴爪！可怕的故事！”

怀特先生没有回答她，因为这时候邮差到了，邮差为他们带来了两封信——但里面并没有钱。早餐后，两位老人已忘记了钱和猴爪的事。

这一天晚些时候，大约l点左右，怀特夫妇坐下来吃东西；又开始了有关钱的谈论，他们没有多少钱，所以他们常常需要谈论钱。

“我们需要那30,000英磅！”怀特太太说。

“可今天上午一分钱也没得到，”他丈夫说，“还是让我们忘掉它吧！”

接着，他说：“但那东西确实移动了。猴爪在我的手里动了！汤姆的故事是真的！”

“你昨晚威士忌喝多了。也许猴爪并未移动。”怀特太太回答道。

“它移动了！”怀特先生恼怒地叫了起来。

开始，他妻子没有理他，好一会儿才说：“赫伯特也嘲笑过这件事……”

突然，她止住话音，站起来向窗户走去。

“怎么啦？”她丈夫问。

“我们的房子前面有一个人，是一个高个子穿着讲究的陌生人，他在朝我们这边看……呵，不……好了……他走了……”怀特太太告诉他丈夫。

“坐下来，吃完你的饭！”怀特先生说。

老妇人并没有听丈夫的话。“他没走，”她继续说，“他又回来了，我不认识他……他是陌生人。不错，他穿得很讲究……”突然，怀特太太不说话了，她很兴奋，“他正朝我们的门口走来……也许他给我们带来了钱！”

她跑出房间，打开了前门。

穿着讲究的高个子陌生人站在那儿。他什么也没说。好一会儿，他才开始说话。“下午好，我找怀特夫妇。”

“哦．我就是怀特太太，”老妇人答道，“我能为你做些什么吗？”

陌生人顿了顿才说：“怀特太太，我从莫和麦金森来，我能进去跟您谈谈吗？”

莫和麦金森有一个大工厂，赫伯特·怀特在那儿当机器操作工。

“当然可以，请进吧。”怀特太太答道。

穿着讲究的陌生人进了小客厅，怀特先生站了起来。

“你是怀特先生吗？”陌生人问。他又继续介绍，“我从莫和麦金森来”。

怀特太太看着陌生人，想道，“也许，他有那笔钱……但为什么来自莫和麦金森？从他的脸色看他并不高兴……为什么？”突然，老妇人很害怕。

“请坐。”怀特先生说，但她妻子已经等得不耐烦了。

“出了什么事？”她叫了起来，“是不是赫伯特……”她几乎不能把话问完。

陌生人并不瞧他们的脸……怀特先生也开始害怕了。

“请告诉我们！”他说。

从莫和麦金森来的人停了好一会儿才开始说：“对不起，非常对不起，今天早晨，工厂发生了一起事故……。”

“到底出了什么事，赫伯特还好吗？”怀特太太又叫了起来。

“是这样……”陌生人慢慢地说。

“他住院了吗？”老妇人问，现在她非常害怕。

“是的，但是……”陌生人看了一眼怀特太太的脸又停了下来。

“他死了吗？赫伯特死啦？”怀特先生平静地问。

“死啦！”不特太太哭叫着。“哦，不……请不要这样说……，不，赫伯特不会死，我们的儿子不会死！”

突然，老妇人不喊了，因为她看见了陌生人的表情。两个老人明白，他们的儿子已经死了！老怀特太太呜咽着，怀特先生搂着她。

过了一会儿，从莫和麦金森来的男人说：“那是一起机器事故，听到赫伯特喊救命，工友们跑过去，可一点办法也没有。只能眼睁睁地看着赫伯特卷进机器里。对不起，非常对不起。”他结束了讲话。

一时间，屋子里非常安静。最后，怀特太太说：“我们的儿子，死了，我们再也不能见到他了，没有他，我们以后的日子怎么过？”

他丈夫说：“他是我们的儿子，我们爱他。”

接着，怀特太太问陌生人：“我们能看看他吗？我们能不能看看我们的儿子？请带我去，我想去看看我的儿子。”

但陌生人很快答道：“不行，最好不要去看他，他们不能马上把机器停下来，赫伯特在里面待了很长时间，并且开始的时候弄不出来，他……”陌生人停了下来，接着他说，“还是别去看他吧！”

陌生人走到窗户边，因为他不想看到两位老人的痛苦的表情，他什么也没说，站在那儿等了好长时间。

然后，他又回过身来开始和两位老人谈话。“还有一件事，你们的儿子是一个好工人，他为莫和麦金森工作了六年。现在，莫和麦金森要在这个不幸的时候帮助你们。”陌生人又停了下来，过了一会儿又说，“莫和麦金森想给你们一些钱。”说完，他把一些东西交到怀特先生手上。

老怀特先生没有看手里的钱，他慢慢地站起来，害怕地看着陌生人，“多少钱？”怀特先生非常平静地问。其实他并不想听到答案。

“30,000英镑。”陌生人说。

Chapter 6

Three days later, in the big, new cemetery two miles from their house, the two old people said goodbye to their dead son. Then they went back to their dark, old house. They did not want to live without Herbert, but they waited for something good to happen, something to help them. The days went by very slowly. Sometimes they did not talk because there was nothing to say without Herbert. And so the days felt very long.

Then, one night, about a week later, Mrs White got out of bed because she could not sleep. She sat by the window and she watched and waited for her son. He did not come and she began to cry quietly.

In the dark her husband heard her and he called, 'Come back to bed. It's cold out there.'

'It's colder for my son,' his wife answered. 'He's out there in the cold cemetery.'

Mrs White did not go back to bed, but Mr White was old and tired and the bed was warm. So, in the end, he went to sleep again. Suddenly he heard a cry from his wife.

'The paw!' she cried. 'The monkey's paw!' She came back to the bed and stood there.

'What is it? What's the matter?' Mr White cried. He sat up in bed. 'What's the matter?' he thought. 'Why is she excited? What's she talking about?' He looked at his wife.

Her face was very white in the dark. 'I want it,' she said quietly, 'and you've got it! Give it to me! Please!'

'What?' Mr White asked.

'The monkey's paw,' Mrs White said. 'Where is it?'

'It's downstairs,' Mr White answered. 'Why?'

Mrs White began to laugh and cry. 'We can have two more wishes!' she cried. 'We had one—but there are two more!'

'Oh, no! Not again! Think, woman!' Mr White cried. But Mrs White did not listen.

'Quickly,' she said. 'Go and get the paw. We're going to wish for our boy to come back to us!'

'No!' Mr White cried. 'You're mad!'

'Get it! Get it quickly!' Mrs White cried again.

Mr White said again, 'Think, woman! Think! Our boy was in the machinery for a long time. They didn't want to show him to us! Think! Do you want to see his body?'

'Yes! He's my son. I'm not afraid of him!' she answered.

'You don't understand,' Mr White said sadly, but he went downstairs to look for the monkey's paw.

In the living-room it was dark and Mr White did not have a candle. Slowly, he went across the room and he put out his hand for the monkey's paw. He touched it, and quickly took his hand away again.

'No!' he thought. 'I can't! I don't want to see Herbert! His face—after he was in the machinery... no!'

Then he thought about his wife—and he put out his hand and took the paw.

In the bedroom his wife waited. She saw the paw in Mr White's hand and cried, 'Quick! Make the wish!'

'I can't,' Mr White answered. 'Remember—he died in the machinery!'

'Make the wish! I'm not afraid of my own son!' Mrs White cried again.

Mr White looked sadly at his wife, but he took the paw in his right hand and said slowly, 'I wish for my son, Herbert, to come back to us. ' Then he sat down in the nearest chair.

But Mrs White went over to the window and looked out into the road. She stayed there for a long time and she did not move. Nothing happened. The monkey's paw could not do it!

'Thank God!' Mr White said, and he went back to bed.

Soon Mrs White went to bed too.

三天后，在离他们家两英里远的一个大而新的墓地，两位老人和他们死去的儿子道别了。然后，他们回到了又黑又旧的房子。没有了赫伯特，他们什么也不想做，他们等待着奇迹发生，等待着什么来帮助他们。时间过得很慢，有时他们连话也不想说，因为没有了赫伯特，就无话可说了。所以他们觉得日子很长。

大约一周后的一天晚上，怀特太太因失眠从床上爬了起来。她坐在窗户边看着，等着她的儿子回来。想到赫伯特再也回不来了，她又低声地哭了起来。

黑暗中，她丈夫听见了她的哭声，叫她：“过来睡吧，那儿太冷了。”

“我儿子那儿更冷，”他妻子回应他，“他一个人待在外面冰冷的墓地里。”

怀特太太没有回去睡觉，但怀特先生因又老又累，加上温暖的被窝，很快又睡着了。突然他听见了妻子的叫声。

“爪子！”她喊道，“猴爪！”她走到床边站在那儿。

“出了什么事？怎么啦？”怀特先生叫着从床上坐了起来，他想，“怎么啦？她为什么那么兴奋？她说什么？”他看着妻子。

她的脸色在黑暗中显得很苍白。“我要猴爪，在你那儿！请把它给我！”她静静地说。

“什么？”怀特先生没听明白。

“猴爪，”怀特太太说，“猴爪在哪儿？”

“在楼下，但你为什么要它？”怀特先生不解。

怀特太太高兴得又笑又叫。“我们可以再许两个愿！我们已经许了一个——还有两个！”

“哦，不！再也不要了！好好想一想，老太太！”怀特先生大叫着，但怀特太太并不听他说的话。

“快点，去把猴爪拿来，我们许愿我们的儿子回到我们身边来！”她说。

“不！你疯啦！”怀特先生叫了起来。

“拿来！快拿来！”怀特太太又喊叫着。

怀特先生劝她，“好好想一想，老太太！想想！我们的孩子在机器里待了那么长时间，人家都不让我们看！你真的想看我们孩子的尸体？”

“是的！他是我儿子，我不害怕！”她回答说。

“你真不可理喻。”怀特先生悲哀地说。但他还是下楼去找猴爪。

客厅里很黑，怀特先生又没有蜡烛。他慢慢地穿过房间，伸手摸索着找猴爪。他摸到了但又很快把手缩了回去。

“不！我不能！我不想看到赫伯特！我不想看到他被机器轧烂的脸……不！”他想。

但他又想到了他可怜的妻子——还是把猴爪拿了起来。

卧室里，妻子在等他。一看到怀特先生手里的猴爪她就叫起来，“快！快许愿！”

“我不能，”怀特先生答道，“记住——他死在机器里了！”

“许愿吧！我不害怕我自己的儿子！”怀特太太又叫道。

怀特先生悲伤地看了一眼他的妻子，把猴爪放在右手里慢慢地说：“我希望我的儿子赫伯特回到我们身边。”说完就在最近的椅子上坐了下来。

怀特太太走到窗户边上看着马路。她长时间地待在那儿一动不动。但什么也没发生，猴爪并不起作用！

“感谢上帝！”怀特先生说着又睡觉去了。

不久，怀特太太也上了床。

Chapter 7

But they did not sleep. They waited and they listened. In the end Mr White got up to get a candle because the dark made him more afraid. He began to go downstairs, but suddenly he heard a noise at the front door. He stopped, and he listened. He could not move. Then the noise came again. This time he ran. He ran upstairs, back into the bedroom and he closed the door behind him. But again the noise came.

'What's that?' Mrs White cried, and she sat up in bed.

'Nothing! Go to sleep again!' her husband answered.

But Mrs White listened—and the noise came again. 'It's Herbert! It's Herbert!' she cried. 'I'm going to open the door for him.'

And she got out of bed and ran to the door of the bedroom. Mr White got there first and stopped her.

'No!' he cried. 'Think!'

'But it's my boy! It's Herbert,' she answered.

'No! Don't go! Don't...' her husband cried again.

But Mrs White did not listen to him. She opened the bedroom door and ran from the room. 'I'm coming, Herbert. I'm coming!' she called.

Mr White ran after her. 'Stop!' he cried. 'Remember, Herbert died in the machinery! You don't want to see him!'

For a minute Mrs White stopped and looked at her husband, but then the noise came again and she began to run downstairs.

'Help me! Help me!' she called to her husband.

But Mr White did not move. 'The paw!' he thought. 'Where's the monkey's paw?'

He ran back into the bedroom. 'Quick!' he thought. 'Where is it?' At first he could not find it in the dark. Ah! There it was! He had it!

Just at that minute he heard his wife downstairs.

'Wait! Wait, Herbert! I'm coming!' she cried. She began to open the front door.

At the same time Mr White took the monkey's paw in his right hand and he made his third wish.

Mrs White gave a long unhappy cry and her husband ran down to her. She stood by the open door. Very afraid, Old Mr White looked out into the dark.

The road was dark and quiet—and there was nobody there.

他们睡不着。他们在等、在听。最终，怀特先生还是起床点了一枝蜡烛，因为黑暗使他们更害怕。他开始下楼，突然，他听到前门有声音。他停住了，仔细地听。他没有动。接着，声音又响了起来，这次他跑上了楼，回到了卧室，关紧了他身后的门，但声音又传来了。

“那是什么？”怀特太太叫着从床上坐了起来。

“什么也没有！睡觉吧！”她丈夫告诉她。

但怀特太太听到声音又响了起来。“是赫伯特！是赫伯特！我要去给他开门。”她叫道。

她起床跑向卧室的门，但怀特先生抢先挡住了她。

“不要这样！要好好想一想！”他叫道。

“但他是我的孩子！他是赫伯特。”她说。

“不！千万不要去！不要……”他丈夫又叫了起来。

但怀特太太并不听他的，她打开卧室的门并从房间里跑了出来。“我来了，赫伯特，我来了！”她喊道。

怀特先生跟在她后面跑，“站住！别忘了赫伯特死在机器里了！你并不想看到他！”

怀特太太停下来看了他的丈夫一会儿，这时，声音又响了起来，她又开始向楼下跑。

“帮帮我！帮帮我！”她叫她的丈夫。

但怀特先生没有动。他想到了猴爪。“猴爪！猴爪放在哪儿了？”

他跑回卧室。他心里在想，“快！猴爪在哪儿？”开始，在黑暗中他找不着，啊！它在那儿！他终于拿到了猴爪！

就在这时，他听到了楼下妻子的声音。

“等一等！等一等，赫伯特！我来啦！”她喊着，并开始开前门。

与此同时，怀特先生把猴爪放在右手里开始许第三个愿。

怀特太太发出一声长长的失望的叫声，她丈夫跑下楼找她，她正站在打开的门旁。老怀特先生看着外面黑漆漆的夜，非常恐惧。

马路很暗且静——一个人影也没有。

Chapter 1

The Creature in the Shop

My name is Dr Frederick Treves. I am a doctor at the London Hospital. One day in 1884, I saw a picture in the window of a shop near the hospital. I stopped in front of the shop and looked at the picture. At first I felt interested, then I felt angry, then afraid. It was a horrible, ugly picture. There was a man in the picture, but he did not look like you and me. He did not look like a man. He looked like an elephant.

I read the writing under the picture. It said:

Come in and see the Elephant Man. 2 pence.

I opened the door and went in.

There was a man in the shop. He was a dirty man in an old coat with a cigarette in his mouth. 'What do you want?' he asked.

'I'd like to see the elephant man, please,' I said.

The man looked at me angrily. 'Well, you can't,' he said. 'The shop's closing now. You can come back tomorrow.'

'I'm sorry,' I said. 'But I would like to see him now. I have no time tomorrow—I have a lot of work to do. But I can give you more than 2 pence.'

The man looked at me carefully. Then he took the cigarette out of his mouth and smiled with his yellow teeth.

'All right, sir,' he said. 'Give me twelve pence then.'

I gave him the money and he opened a door at the back of the shop. We went into a little room. The room was cold and dark, and there was a horrible smell in it.

A creature sat on a chair behind a table. I say a creature, because it was not a man or a woman, like you or me. The creature did not move or look at us. It sat very quietly on the chair in the cold, dark, dirty room, and looked at the table. The creature had a cloth over its head, because of the cold. On the table in front of it, there was a dead flower.

'Stand up!' said the shopkeeper, loudly.

The creature stood up slowly. It took the old cloth off its head, and put it on the chair.

I looked at the creature and felt sad. I am a doctor, so I know a lot about accidents and ill people. I see horrible, ugly things every day. But this creature, this thing, was the worst of all. There were no men or women in the hospital like him.

He wore some old trousers, but no shirt, coat, or shoes, so I could see his body very well. His head was the most interesting thing. It was very, very big—like an enormous bag with a lot of books in it. The head did not have much hair, and there was another bag of brown, dirty skin at the back of it. This skin came down below his neck. I could not see one of his eyes very well, because a lot of skin came down in front of his face, too.

An enormous red tooth came out of his mouth, under his nose. It looked like an elephant's tooth. The mouth and nose were like holes in the face. The face could not smile or laugh or look angry or sad, because the skin could not move. It was dead, like an elephant's face.

There were more bags of dirty skin on the front and back of the creature's body. These bags came down to his legs. The right arm was enormous, and there were bags of skin on it, too. The right hand was like a man's foot.

But the left hand—the left arm and the left hand were beautiful! The left arm had wonderful skin, and the fingers of the left hand were long and beautiful. It was like a young woman's hand!

'Walk, Merrick!' said the shopkeeper angrily. 'Come on, quickly, move!' He hit the creature with his hand.

Slowly, the creature walked across the room. But he could not walk well. His legs were very big and fat, and he had a bad back. He could not walk far without a stick.

'All right, thank you,' I said. 'Let him sit down. I don't want to see any more.' I felt ill, and the smell in the room was very bad.

'Yes, sir,' said the shopkeeper. 'Sit down, Merrick.'

We went out of the room and closed the door. The shopkeeper smiled at me with his yellow teeth.

'Wonderful, sir, isn't it?' he said. 'The best Elephant Man in England! Hundreds of people come to see him, you know, hundreds! I take him all over the country, I do!'

'Yes, very interesting,' I said. 'Can I sit down?'

'Yes, sir, of course. Here's a chair.' He looked at me, smiling. 'Would you like a glass of water, sir?'

'Yes, please,' I said. Then I looked at the things in the dirty shop. There were two or three bad apples and some old black bananas: that was all. 'Er, no... no, thank you. I'm all right,' I said. 'Did you... did you call the creature Merrick?'

'That's right, sir. Joseph Merrick. The best Elephant Man in England! I take him all over the country, you know. Lots of people want to see him.'

'Yes, I see. Do you get a lot of money?'

'Well, sometimes we do, sir, yes. But it's difficult, you see, sir, because of the police. The police don't like us, you see, sir. So we can't stay in a town very long. We usually move every week.'

'Yes, I see. Well, anyway, Mr...er?'

'Silcock, sir. Simon Silcock.'

'Yes, well, Mr Silcock, I'm a doctor at the London Hospital. My name is Dr Treves. I think this... er... this man Joseph Merrick is very interesting, and I would like to see him at the hospital. I want to look at him more carefully, you see.'

'Yes sir, I see. But how can he get to the hospital? It's going to be difficult.'

'Why, man? The hospital's not far from here.'

'Well, yes, sir. I know. But, you see, Merrick can't walk very well. He needs help.'

'You can come with him. Do you want more money? Is that it?'

'Well, yes, sir, I do. But, you see, people are afraid of him too... In the road, little boys always run after him and hit him. Then the police get angry because people are afraid. Sometimes they take us to prison.'

'I see,' I said. 'Well, how can he come to the hospital, then?'

'Bring a cab, sir,' said Silcock. 'You can take him to the hospital in a cab.'

1 　店铺里的怪物

我是弗雷德里克·特里夫斯医生，伦敦医院的医生。1884年的一天，我在医院附近一家店铺的橱窗里看见了一张照片。我在店铺前停了下来，看着这张照片。起先我觉得这张照片挺有趣，后来就感到生气、害怕起来。那是一张可怕的、丑陋的照片。照片上有个男人，但和你我不同。他看上去不像个人，而像一头大象。

我看了看照片下面的文字，上面写着：

进来吧，看看这个象人，一次两便士。

我推开门走了进去。

店里有个男人，邋邋遢遢的，穿着一件旧外套，嘴里叼着一支烟。“你想干什么？”他问道。

“我想看看象人。”我说。

这个人生气地看着我。“不行。”他说，“店铺现在关门了，你明天来吧。”

“对不起，”我说，“我想现在就看，明天我没有空——我有许多事情要做，我可以另外多给你一些钱。”

这个人仔细地打量着我，后来他取下嘴里的烟卷笑了起来，露出了满嘴黄牙。

他说，“好吧，先生。就给12便士吧。”

我把钱给了他，他就打开了店铺后门。我们走进一个小房间，房间又冷又暗，里面还有一股恶心的气味。

一个怪物坐在桌子后面的椅子上。我称他为怪物，是因为他不像你和我，不是男人也不是女人。他一动不动，也没有看我们，只是安静地坐在这间又冷又暗又脏的房间里的椅子上，眼睛盯着桌子。由于阴冷，这个怪物的头上盖着一块布，在他面前的桌子上放着一朵枯萎的花。

“站起来！”店老板大声地说。

怪物慢慢地站起来，取下头上的盖布放在椅子上。

看着这个怪物，我感到很悲伤。我是一个医生，我很熟悉事故和病人。我每天要遇到许多可怕的、丑恶的东西，可这个怪物却是最糟糕的。医院里没有任何一个男人或女人像他这个样子。

他穿着条旧裤子，没有穿衬衫、外套和鞋子。所以，我可以清楚地看见他的身体。他的头部最有趣，长得很大很大——就像一个装着许多书籍的大口袋。头上头发不多，脑后还耷拉着一块褐色的、肮脏的头皮，一直垂到脖子下面。我看不见他的一只眼睛，因为大块的皮肤也从脸部垂下来。

鼻子下面一颗巨大的红牙齿从嘴里露出来，就像一颗象牙，嘴和鼻子就像是脸上开的洞，从他脸上看不出微笑还是大笑，也看不出生气和悲伤，因为这种皮肤无法活动，它已经失去了活力，像一只大象的脸。

这个怪物身体的前胸和后背的脏皮肤上有许多囊肿，这种囊肿（包状物）一直拖到他的腿部。他的右臂巨大，皮肤上也有包状物，右手像男人的脚。

然而左手——左臂和左手——却是长得很美！左臂上有漂亮的皮肤，左手手指纤长、美丽，就像年轻女人的手一样。

“走一走，梅里克！”店老板生气地说，“朝前走，动一动，快！”他用手打着这个怪物。

慢慢地，这个怪物走到房间的对面。可他腿脚不便，他的腿又粗又肥，背部有病，没有拐杖走不远。

“好了，谢谢你，”我说，“让他坐下来，我不想再看什么了。”我感到恶心，房间里的气味难闻极了。

“好的，先生，”店老板说着。“坐下，梅里克。”

我们走出房间，关上门。店老板朝我笑了笑，露出满嘴黄牙。

“好极了，先生，是不是？”他说，“这是英国最棒的象人！成百上千的人来看他，知道吗？成百上千！我带他到全国各地去，真的！”

“是的，挺有意思！”我说，“我可以坐下吗？”

“当然可以，先生。请坐。”他朝我看了看，笑了笑说：“来杯水吗，先生？”

“好的，请给我一杯水，”我说。接着我朝脏商店里那些东西看着，有两三个坏苹果、几根烂香蕉。仅此而已。“啊！不……不，谢谢，我没事！”我说。“你……你把这个怪物叫作梅里克吗？”

“不错，先生，约瑟夫·梅里克。英国最棒的象人！我把他带到全国各地去，你知道，许多人要看他。”

“是的，我明白。那你会赚到很多钱吗？”

“嗯，有时会赚到很多钱，先生。但是也很难，因为警察找麻烦，你知道的，先生，警察不喜欢我们，所以我们不能在一个城镇待很长时间，通常每星期就换个地方。”

“是的，我明白，噢，……先生，您是……呃？”

“西尔科克，先生。西蒙·西尔科克。”

“是的，哦，西尔科克先生，我是伦敦医院的一个医生。我是特里夫斯医生。我想，这个……呃……约瑟夫·梅里克这个人非常有趣，我想在医院里看看他，我想更仔细地观察他，你看怎么样？”

“是的，先生，我明白您的意思！但是，他怎能到医院去呢？这是很困难的。”

“为什么不行呢，先生，医院离这儿不远。”

“是的，先生，我知道，但是，您看，梅里克腿脚不灵便，他需要别人帮他。”

“你可以和他一块儿来，你还要钱吗？是这样吗？”

“噢，是的，先生，但是，你知道，人们也害怕他……走在路上，小男孩们总是追他打他。警察也会生气，怪他吓着了大家。有时候警察就把我们送进监狱里。”

“我明白，”我说，“那么，他怎么能到医院里去呢？”

“弄一辆马车来，先生，”西尔科克说，“您可以用马车送他去医院。”

Chapter 2

The Card

So next day, at seven o'clock, I came to the shop in a cab. There were not very many people in the road, because it was early in the morning. In November it is dark at seven o'clock in the morning, and I could not see the shop very well. I waited five minutes. A postman walked past. Then the door of the shop opened, and the creature, Merrick, came out.

I could not see his face or his body. He had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box. A grey cloth came down from the hat, in front of his face. There was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes. He could see out of the hole but I could not see in. He wore a long black coat, too. The coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so I could not see his arms, his body, or his legs. On his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags.

He had a stick in his left hand, and he walked very slowly. I opened the door of the cab, and got out.

'Good morning, Mr Merrick,' I said. 'Can you get in?'

'Elpmyupasteps,' he said.

'I'm sorry,' I said. 'I don't understand.'

For a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing. Then he hit the cab with his stick.

'STEPS!' he said loudly. 'Help me up the steps!'

Then I understood. There were three steps up into the cab, and he could not get up them.

'Yes, I see. I'm sorry,' I said. 'Let me help you.'

I took his left hand and began to help him. My right hand was behind his back. I felt very strange. His left hand was like a young woman's, but his back under the coat, was horrible. I could feel the bags of old skin on his back under the coat.

He put one enormous foot on the first step, and then he stopped. After a minute, he moved his second foot slowly. Then he stopped and waited again.

'Hello, sir. Can I help you?'

I looked behind me. It was the postman. And behind him, I could see three young boys. One of the boys laughed.

The postman smiled. 'Is the gentleman ill?' he asked.

I thought quickly. 'Yes. But this is a lady, not a gentleman. I'm a doctor, and she's ill. Take her hand, so I can help her better.'

The postman took Merrick's left hand, and I helped him with two hands from behind. Slowly, very slowly, Merrick went up the steps and into the cab.

One boy was very near the cab. He called to his friends.

'Come and see this, boys! A fat lady in a black coat! And look at that enormous hat!'

The boys laughed. They were very near the cab too, now. I closed the door quickly.

'Thank you,' I said to the postman.

'That's all right, sir,' he said. 'She's a strange lady, sir, isn't she?'

'She's ill, that's all,' I said quickly. 'We're going to the hospital. Goodbye, and thank you.'

The cab drove down the road to the hospital. I looked at Merrick. 'That was difficult, wasn't it?' I said.

At first he said nothing, but then he spoke. His voice was very strange, but I listened to him carefully, and I could understand him.

'The steps were very difficult,' he said. 'But most things are difficult for me.'

'Yes,' I said. 'Nothing is easy for you, is it?'

'No,' he said. He was very quiet for a minute. Then he said, 'Who are you, sir?'

'Who am I? Oh, I'm sorry, My name is Dr Treves. Here, this is my card.'

I gave him a card with my name on. Then I thought, 'That was no good. This man can't read.' But Merrick took the card and looked at it very carefully. Then he put it in his trousers pocket.

I did not talk to him very much at the hospital. I looked at his head and arms and legs and body very carefully. Then I wrote the important things about him in a little book. A nurse helped me. Merrick looked at her sometimes, but she did not smile at him or talk to him. I think she was afraid of him. I think Merrick was afraid too, because he was very quiet.

At four o'clock I took him back to the shop in a cab. The next day I looked in the shop window again, but the picture was not there.

2 　名片

于是第二天7点钟，我乘着马车来到这家商店。天刚刚亮，路上没有多少人。11月份的早上7点钟天还是黑的，商店还看不太清楚。我等了五分钟，一个邮递员恰好经过，后来商店门开了，那个怪物——梅里克出来了。

我看不见他的脸和身体，他头上戴着一顶大黑帽子，就像顶着一个大盒子。帽子上搭着一块灰色的布一直遮着脸，眼睛前面的布上有个洞，他可以从洞里朝外看，可我却看不见里面。他还穿了一件黑色的长外套，外套从颈子上一直拖到脚下，所以我看不见他的手臂、身体和腿。他脚上穿着一双大鞋，就像两条旧口袋。

他左手拄着一根拐杖，走得很慢，我打开车门，走了出来。

“早上好，梅里克先生，”我说，“你能上去吗？”

“Elpmyupasteps.”他说。

“对不起，”我说，“我听不懂。”

他在车门边站了一会儿，什么话也没有说。后来他用拐杖敲了敲车子。

“上台阶！”他大声地说，“帮我上台阶！”

后来，我明白了，马车上有三级台阶，他迈不上去。

“噢，对不起，”我说，“我来帮你。”

我拉着他的左手，右手扶着他的背帮助他上车。我觉得很奇怪，他的左手就像年轻女人的手，而他外套里面的背部却是很可怕。我可以隔着外套摸到背上那些老皮囊肿。

他一只大脚先迈上了头一个台阶，就停下了。过了一会儿，又慢慢地挪动另外一只脚，然后又停了下来再次等着。

“喂，先生，要我帮忙吗？”

我朝身后一看，是那位邮递员，在他的身后还有三个小男孩，其中有一个在大声笑着。

这位邮递员微笑着问：“这位先生病了吗？”

我灵机一动：“对，但这是位女士，不是先生。我是医生，她病了。拉着她的手，这样我能更好地帮助她。”

邮递员拉着梅里克的左手，我用双手从后面推他。梅里克慢慢地移动步子，走进马车。

一个小男孩离马车很近，他对着他的伙伴们大声地喊着：“过来看，一个穿黑外套的胖女人！瞧那顶大帽子！”

孩子们哄笑着走到马车旁，我迅速地关上了车门。

我对邮递员说：“谢谢你。”

他说：“不用谢，先生。这位女士很怪呀！”

我很快地回答：“她是病人，仅此而已。我们要去医院，谢谢你，再见。”

马车沿着去医院的路驶去。我看了看梅里克说：“很不容易，是吧？”

他先是什么都不说，可后来他开口了，他的嗓音很怪，可我还是认真地听着，我能听懂他讲的意思。

“上台阶很困难。”他说，“大多数事情对于我来说，都很困难。”

“对您来说没有容易的事，对吧？”我说。

“对。”他沉默了一会儿，然后问道：“您是谁，先生？”

“我是谁？哦，对不起，我是特里夫斯医生。瞧，这是我的名片。”

我递给了他一张上面有我名字的名片。但转念一想，这没什么用，他不识字。梅里克拿着名片认真地看了看，然后就塞进裤子口袋里。

在医院里我和他谈得不多，我很仔细地看过他的头、手臂、腿和身子，然后我将有关他的重要情况记在了一个小笔记本里。一位护士来协助我工作。梅里克时不时地朝她看看，可她既不朝他微笑也不与他说话。我想她是怕他，梅里克可能也怕她，因为他一直很安静。

4点钟时，我用马车将他送回那个商店。第二天我又朝小店橱窗里看了看，可那张照片已不见了。

Chapter 3

A Letter to 'The Times'

I did not see Merrick again for two years. Then, one day, the police found him. He had my card in his hand, so they brought him to the London Hospital. He was very tired, hungry, and dirty, so I put him to bed in a quiet little room. But he could not stay at the hospital. He was not ill, and of course the beds in the hospital are for ill people. We have no beds for hungry people, or ugly people.

I told the Hospital Chairman, Mr Carr Gomm, about Merrick. He listened carefully, and then he wrote a letter to the editor of The Times newspaper.

From The Times, December 4th, 1886

A Letter to the Editor.

Dear Sir,

I am writing to you about a man in our hospital. He needs your help. His name is Joseph Merrick, and he is 27 years old. He is not ill, but he cannot go out of the hospital because he is very, very ugly. Nobody likes to look at him, and some people are afraid of him. We call him 'The Elephant Man'.

Two years ago, Merrick lived in a shop near the London Hospital. For two pence, people could see him and laugh at him. One day Dr Frederick Treves—a hospital doctor—saw Merrick, brought him to this hospital, and looked at him carefully. Dr Treves could not help Merrick, but he gave him his card.

Then the shopkeeper, Silcock, took Merrick to Belgium. A lot of people in Belgium wanted to see him, and so after a year Merrick had ￡50. But then Silcock took Merrick's ￡50, left Merrick in Belgium, and went back to London.

Merrick came back to London by himself. Everyone on the train and the ship looked at him, and laughed at him. In London, the police put him in prison. But then they saw Dr Treves's card, and brought Merrick to the London Hospital.

This man has no money, and he cannot work. His face and body are very, very ugly, so of course many people are afraid of him. But he is a very interesting man. He can read and write, and he thinks a lot. He is a good, quiet man. Sometimes he makes things with his hands and gives them to the nurses, because they are kind to him.

He remembers his mother, and he has a picture of her. She was beautiful and kind, he says. But he never sees her now. She gave him to Silcock a long time ago.

Can the readers of The Times help us? This man is not ill, but he needs a home. We can give him a room at the hospital, but we need some money. Please write to me at the London Hospital.

Yours faithfully,

F.C. Carr Gomm

Chairman of the London Hospital

The readers of The Times are very kind people. They gave us a lot of money. After one week, we had ￡50, 000, so Merrick could live in the Hospital for all his life. We could give him a home.

3 　给《泰晤士报》的一封信

我有两年未见到梅里克了。后来有一天，警察发现了他，他手里有我的名片，所以警察就将他带到伦敦医院。他很疲劳、饥饿、肮脏，我就把他安置在一间很安静的小房间里休息。但因为他没有生病，他不能待在医院里，医院里的床当然是给病人用的。我们不能给饥饿的人或丑陋的人提供床铺使用。

我将梅里克的情况告诉了院长卡尔·戈姆先生。他听得很仔细，并给《泰晤士报》的编辑写了一封信。

摘自1886年12月4日的《泰晤士报》

致编辑的一封信。

亲爱的先生：

我写信给你是告诉你一个在我们医院里的人的情况，他需要得到你的帮助。他名叫约瑟夫·梅里克，现年27岁。他没有生病，但是他不能走出医院，因为他长得很丑很丑，没有人愿意看他一眼，一些人害怕他，我们叫他“象人”。

两年前，梅里克住在伦敦医院附近的一家商店里，花两个便士，人们就可以看到他、嘲笑他。有一天，医院医生弗雷德里克·特里夫斯医生见到了梅里克，将他带到我们医院里，并给他仔细检查。由于特里夫斯医生无法帮助梅里克，只好给了他一张名片。

后来店老板西尔科克将他带到了比利时，在那儿许多人都想看他，所以，一年后，梅里克挣到了50英镑。但是后来西尔科克拿走了梅里克的50英镑，将他留在比利时，而自己回到了伦敦。

梅里克是独自一人回到伦敦的，火车上、轮船上的每个人都看着他、嘲笑他。在伦敦，警察把他关进监狱。但后来，他们看到特里夫斯医生的名片，就把梅里克带到了伦敦医院。

他没有钱，又不能工作，他的脸和身体都非常丑陋，当然许多人都害怕他。但是，他是一个很有趣的人，他能读书写字，会思考，他是一个安份的好人。有时他用自己的双手做些玩意儿送给护士们，因为她们对他很和善。

他记得他的母亲，他有他母亲的一张照片。他说他的母亲很漂亮、温柔。但是，现在他再也没有见过她。她在很久以前就将他给了西尔科克。

《泰晤士报》的读者们能否帮助我们？这个人没有生病，但他需要有一个家，我们在医院里可以给他一间房子，但我们需要钱，请给我回信到伦敦医院来。

你的忠实的　　　

F．C．卡尔·戈姆

伦敦医院院长　　

《泰晤士报》的读者们都很仁慈，他们给了我们很多钱。一星期后，我们收到了五万英镑，足够让梅里克在医院里住一辈子。我们可以给他安个家。

Chapter 4

Merrick's First Home

We gave Merrick two rooms at the back of the hospital. One room was a bathroom, so he could have a bath every day. Soon his skin was much better, and there was no horrible smell.

The second room had a bed, table, and chairs. I visited him every day, and talked to him. He loved reading, and talking about books. At first he did not know many books: the Bible, and one or two newspapers, that's all. But I gave him some books of love stories, and he liked them very much. He read them again and again, and talked about them often. For him, the men and women in these books were alive, like you and me. He was very happy.

But sometimes it was difficult for him. At first, one or two people in the hospital laughed at Merrick because he was ugly. Sometimes, they brought their friends to look at him. One day a new nurse came to the hospital, and nobody told her about Merrick. She took his food to his room, and opened the door. Then she saw him. She screamed, dropped the food on the floor, and ran out of the room.

I was very angry with the nurse, and went to see Merrick. He was not happy about it, but he was not very angry. I think he felt sorry for the girl.

'People don't like looking at me. I know that, Dr Treves,' he said. 'They usually laugh or scream.'

'Well, I don't want nurses to laugh at you, Joseph,' I said angrily. 'I want them to help you.'

'Thank you, doctor,' he said, in his strange slow voice. 'But it's not important. Everyone laughs at me. I understand that.'

I looked at him sadly. In his one good hand, his left hand, he had the little picture of his mother. He looked at the picture for a minute, and then put it by a flower on the table. A tear ran out of his eye and down the skin of his enormous, ugly face.

'Dr Treves,' he said, slowly. 'You and the nurses are very kind, and I'm very happy here. Thank you very much. But...I know I can't stay here long, and... I would like to live in a lighthouse, after the hospital, please. A lighthouse, or a home for blind people. I think those are the best places for me.'

'What do you mean?' I asked. 'Why?'

He did not look at me. He put the flower on the picture and looked at it carefully.

'Lighthouses have sea all round them, don't they?' he said. 'Nobody could look at me in a lighthouse, so I would be happy there. And blind people can see nothing, so they couldn't see me, could they?'

'But Joseph,' I said. 'This is your home. You live here now. You aren't going to leave the hospital.'

'Not today, perhaps,' he said. 'But soon. You are a kind man, Dr Treves. But I can't stay here very long. I have no money.'

I smiled. 'Joseph,' I said. 'This is your home now. Don't you understand? You can stay here all your life.' Very carefully, I told him about the letter to The Times, and the money.

I don't think he understood at first, so I told him again. He was very quiet for a minute. Then he stood up, and walked up and down the room very quickly. A strange sound came from him, like laughing.

4 　梅里克的第一个家

我们将医院后面的两个房间给了梅里克，一间是浴室，供他每天洗澡。于是他的皮肤好多了，再也没有难闻的气味。

另一间里面有床、桌子和椅子。我每天都去看他，陪他说话。他喜欢看书，也喜欢谈论书里的内容。起初，他并不知道多少书，只知道《圣经》和一两份报纸而已。后来我给了他几本爱情小说，他非常喜欢，看了一遍又一遍，并经常谈论其中的故事。对他来说，书中的男女就像你我一样，都是鲜活的，他非常高兴。

但对他来说，有时也很难。开始时，医院里有一两个人嘲笑他，说他长得丑陋，有时他们把自己的朋友带来参观他。有一天，一个护士新来到医院，没有人把梅里克的情况告诉她，她给梅里克送饭，当她打开门，见到他时，尖叫一声，将饭扔在地上跑了出去。

我去看望梅里克，我很生这个护士的气。他对此事感到不高兴但没生气，我想他觉得自己对不起这个姑娘。

他说：“人们不喜欢朝我看，他们经常对我嘲笑、尖叫，我知道为什么，特里夫斯医生。”

我气愤地说：“约瑟夫，我不希望护士们嘲笑你，我要她们来帮助你。”

“谢谢你，大夫。”他用奇怪的声音慢慢说着：“每个人都在嘲笑我，我理解，这并不重要。”

我忧伤地看着他。他的那只好手——左手——拿着一张他母亲的小照片，他看了一会儿照片，然后将照片放在桌上的一朵花旁，一滴泪水顺着他那张丑陋的大脸滚下来。

“特里夫斯医生，您和这些护士们都是非常善良的，我在这儿很幸福。非常感谢您。可是……我知道我不能长期待在这儿，那么……出院后我想要住到一座灯塔里。一座灯塔或是盲人之家，我想那对我来说是最好的地方。”他慢慢地说道。

我问：“你这是什么意思？为什么？”

他不看我，他把那束花放在那张照片上，仔细地看着。

他说：“灯塔四周是大海，对不对？在那里没有人朝我看，所以在那里我会幸福的。盲人什么也看不见，所以他们也看不见我，是不是？”

我说：“约瑟夫，这就是你的家，现在你就住在这儿，你不要离开医院。”

他说：“可能不会是今天，但会很快。您是一个好人，特里夫斯医生。可我不能在这儿待很长时间，我没有钱。”我笑着说：“约瑟夫，现在这儿就是你的家 。你难道还不明白吗？你可以在这儿待一辈子。”于是我把写给《泰晤士报》的那封信及有关钱的来历详详细细地告诉了他。

开始我担心他不能理解此事，所以就又说了一遍。他沉默了片刻，然后站起来在房间里很快地来回走动着，并发出一种奇怪的声音，像是在大笑。

Chapter 5

An Important Visitor

I did not want Merrick to live by himself, like a man in a lighthouse. He read his books, and talked to me, but I wanted him to talk to more people. And I wanted him to talk to women.

Merrick read about women in his books, but he did not often talk to women. He met the nurses every day, but they did not talk to him very much. For them, he was always a creature, not a man.

One day, one of my friends, a beautiful young woman, came to the hospital. I told her about Merrick, and took her to his room. She opened the door, and smiled at him.

'Good morning, Mr Merrick,' she said. Then she shook his hand.

Merrick looked at her for a minute with his mouth open. Then he sat down on his bed, with his head in his hand, and cried. He cried for nearly five minutes. The tears ran down his face, between his fingers, and onto the floor.

My friend sat on the bed beside him and put her hand on his arm. She said nothing, but she smiled at him and shook his hand again before she left.

'Dr Treves,' he said to me that night. 'That lady was wonderful! My mother smiled at me once, many years ago, but no women smile at me now. But this lady smiled at me too, and she shook my hand! A beautiful lady smiled at me and shook my hand!'

My young lady friend came again the next week, and talked to Merrick for half an hour. The week after that, she came again with a friend. They gave him some books, and had a cup of tea with him. It was wonderful for him. For the first time in his life, he had some friends. He was a very happy man. He sat in his room, and read his books, and said no more about living on a lighthouse.

People began to read about Merrick in the newspapers, so he had a lot of visitors. Everybody wanted to see him. A lot of important ladies and gentlemen visited him. They smiled at him, shook his hand, and gave him books. Merrick liked talking to these people, and he began to forget about his ugly body. His visitors never laughed at him. He began to feel like a man, not a creature.

One wonderful day, a very important lady came to the hospital to visit him. I met the lady, and took her to his room. Then I opened the door, and smiled at him.

'Good morning, Joseph,' I said. 'There is a new visitor to see you today. A very famous lady.'

Merrick stood up beside his table. He did not smile, because his face could not smile, but his eyes looked happy.

'That's good,' he said. 'Who is it?'

I moved away from the door, and the visitor walked in. 'Your Majesty, this is Joseph Merrick,' I said. 'Joseph, this is Her Majesty, Queen Alexandra, the Queen of England.'

Queen Alexandra smiled at him. 'How do you do, Mr Merrick,' She said. 'I'm very pleased to meet you.' Then she shook his hand.

Merrick did not move. For nearly half a minute he stood and looked at her with his mouth open. Then he spoke, in his strange, slow voice.

'How... how do you do, Your Majesty,' he said. But I don't think the Queen understood him, because he tried to get down on his knees at the same time. It was very difficult for him, because of his enormous legs.

'No, please, Mr Merrick, do get up,' said the Queen. 'I would like to talk to you. Can we sit at your table?'

'Yes... yes, of course,' he said. They sat at the table. She took his left hand, the good hand, in hers. She looked at the hand carefully, and then smiled at Merrick again.

'I often read about you in the newspapers,' she said. 'You are a very interesting man, Mr Merrick. You have a very difficult life, but people say you're happy. Is it true? Are you happy now?'

'Oh, yes, Your Majesty, yes!' said Merrick. 'I'm a very happy man! I have a home here now, and friends, and my books. I'm happy every hour of the day!'

'What a wonderful story!' she said. 'I'm very pleased to hear it. Now, tell me about your reading. I see you have a lot of books here.'

'Oh, yes, Your Majesty. I love my books,' said Merrick. And for nearly half an hour they sat and talked about books. The Queen gave him a little book, and some red flowers, before she left.

After her visit, Merrick began to sing. He could not sing easily, of course, because of his mouth, but all that day there was a strange, happy noise in his room. He looked at the flowers carefully, and put them on his table.

He had many visits from the Queen, and at Christmas she sent him a Christmas card.

The present was a picture of Queen Alexandra, with her name on it. Merrick cried over it, and put it carefully by the bed in his room. Then he sat down and wrote a letter to the Queen. It was the first letter of his life.

My dear Queen ,

Thank you very, very much for your wonderful card and the beautiful picture. It is the best thing in my room, the very best, the most beautiful thing I have. This is the first Christmas in my life, and my first Christmas present. Perhaps I had a Christmas with my mother once, but I do not remember it. I have my mother's picture too, and she is beautiful, like you. But now I know many famous ladies and kind people like Dr Treves, and I am a very happy man. I am happy too because I am going to see you in the New Year.

Happy Christmas to you, my dear friend,

With all my love,　　

Joseph Merrick

5 　一位重要的来访者

我不愿梅里克独自居住，就像一个灯塔守望人那样。他看书，也和我聊天，但我却想让他与更多的人特别是妇女们交谈。

梅里克在书中读到过有关妇女的事，可他不常与妇女们说话。他每天都与护士接触，可她们不常与他说话，在她们的眼里，他始终是一个怪物而不是一个人。

有一天，我的一位朋友，一位年轻漂亮的女子来到了医院，我告诉她有关梅里克的事，并把她领到他的房间。她打开房门，朝他微笑。

“早上好，梅里克先生。”她握住他的手说。

梅里克张着嘴朝她看了一会儿，然后坐到床上捂着头哭了起来。他哭了近五分钟时间，泪水从指缝里滚落到地上。

我的这位朋友靠近他坐在他的床上，把手放在他的手臂上，什么也没说，只是朝他微笑，离开前又与他握手道别。

那天晚上他对我说：“特里夫斯医生，那位女士好极了！我的母亲曾经朝我微笑过，那是很多年以前的事了。直到现在没有一个女人朝我笑过，可是这位女士朝我微笑，还握了我的手！一个漂亮的女士朝我微笑，握我的手！”

第二个星期，我的那位年轻的朋友又来了，与梅里克谈了半个小时。又过了一个星期，她又与另一个朋友一道来了。她们送给他一些书，和他一起喝了茶。对他来说这比什么都好，人生中第一次有了一些朋友。他很高兴，坐在屋子里看书，再也不提生活在灯塔里的事了。

人们开始从报纸上看到有关梅里克的报道，所以他有了许多来访者。每个人都想去看他，许多有身份的女士和绅士们访问了他，他们朝他微笑，和他握手，送给他许多书。梅里克喜欢与这些人交谈，渐渐忘了自己那丑陋的样子。他的来访者从不嘲笑他，他开始觉得自己像个人，而不再是个怪物了。

一天，天气非常宜人，一位很有身份的女士来到医院拜访他。我见到这位女士，把她带到他的房间。我打开门，冲他微笑。

“约瑟夫，早上好！今天有一位新客人来拜访你，是一位名人。”我对他说道。

梅里克从桌子旁站了起来。他没有笑，因为他的脸不会笑，但从他的眼睛里能看出他很高兴。

他说：“太好了，是谁？”

我从门口闪开，把来访者让进屋，给他们介绍说：“陛下，这是约瑟夫·梅里克。约瑟夫，这是亚历山德拉女王陛下，当今英国女王。”

亚历山德拉女王朝他笑着说：“梅里克先生，你好。见到你非常高兴。”随后她又握了握他的手。

梅里克没有动，站在那里张着嘴朝她看了约半分钟之久，然后他说话了，声音奇怪而缓慢。“噢……陛下，您好！”他说道。我不知王后是否听清了他的话，因为与此同时他想要跪下，给王后行礼，但由于他那两条腿太粗了，他很难跪下。

王后说：“梅里克先生，请不必这样，起来吧。我想与你说说话，我们可以在你的桌旁坐坐吗？”

他回答着：“是的……是的，当然可以。”他们都在桌子旁坐下，她拉着他的左手，也就是那只好手。她仔细看了看他的手后又朝梅里克笑了笑说。

“我常在报纸上看到有关你的情况，你是一个很有趣的人，你生活虽难以自理，但人们说你很幸福，是真的吗？你现在很幸福吗？”她说。

梅里克回答说：“嗯，陛下，是的！我是一个很幸福的人！现在我在这有一个家，有许多朋友，还有许多书。我每时每刻都很愉快！”

她说：“多么精彩的故事！我非常想听，请把你读到的讲给我听，我发现你这儿有许多书。”

梅里克说：“哦，陛下，是的，我喜欢这些书。”他们坐在那儿就书上的事谈了近半个小时。王后离开时送给了他一本小书和一些红花。

女王走后，梅里克开始唱歌。尽管他的嘴不能自如地歌唱，但那一整天他的房间里都回荡着奇怪、幸福的歌声。他仔细看了看这些花，将它们摆在桌子上。

王后多次拜访他，圣诞节那天她寄给他一张圣诞卡片。

亲爱的约瑟夫：

给你一个小小的圣诞礼物，我想你见到它会像见到我本人一样的，是吗？我很喜欢拜访你，我将在新年那天去医院看你。

祝圣诞快乐！

你的朋友　亚历山德拉

1888年12月20日于温莎城堡

这份礼物是亚历山德拉王后的一张照片，上面有她的名字。梅里克高兴地叫出声来，仔细地把它放在房间里他的床边，然后坐下来给王后写信。这是他有生以来写的第一封信。

亲爱的王后：

您好！非常感谢您给我精美的卡片和漂亮的照片，这是我房间里最好的东西，也是我所拥有的最好最漂亮的东西。我有生以来第一次过圣诞节，这是我的第一个圣诞节礼物。也许我曾与母亲一起度过一个圣诞节，但我已记不住了。我也有一张母亲的照片，她很漂亮，像您一样。现在我认识许多有名望的女士和像特里夫斯医生一样的好心人，我是一个很幸福的人。我很高兴将在新年时再次见到您。

祝我亲爱的朋友圣诞节愉快！

热爱您的　约瑟夫·梅里克

1888年12月23日于伦敦医院

Chapter 6

Outside the Hospital

Merrick had a lot of friends now, but he was more like a child than a man. He could read about things, and talk to his visitors, but he could not go out of the hospital by himself. He thought and played like a child.

After Christmas, he wanted to go to the theatre. This was very difficult, because I did not want the people in the theatre to see him. But a kind lady from the theatre—Mrs Kendal—helped us. We bought tickets for a box at the side of the theatre. We went to the theatre in a cab with dark windows, and we went into the theatre by a door at the back—the Queen's door. Nobody saw us.

Three nurses sat at the front of the box, and Merrick and I sat in the dark behind them. Nobody in the theatre could see us, but we could see the play.

It was a children's Christmas play. Merrick loved it. It was a most wonderful, exciting story. Often he laughed, and sometimes he tried to sing like the children in the theatre. He was like a child. For him, everything in the story was true.

Once he was very afraid, because the bad man in the play was angry and had a knife. At first Merrick wanted to leave the theatre, but I stopped him. Then he was very angry with this bad man in the play. He hit his hand on his chair, and stood up and talked to the man. But nobody heard him. When the bad man went to prison, Merrick laughed.

Merrick thought the beautiful young lady in the play was wonderful. He wanted to talk to her too. At the end of the play he was very happy because she married a good young man.

He remembered this play for a long time, and he talked a lot about the people in it. 'What do you think they did after we left?' he asked me. 'Where do the young lady and the young man live? What are they doing now?'

'I don't know,' I said. 'Perhaps they live in the country.'

Merrick thought about this for a long time. Then he said: 'Dr Treves, can I go to the country, please? I saw the country once from a train, but I never went there. I often read about it in books. It's very beautiful, isn't it? I would like to see it.'

The visit to the theatre was difficult but a visit to the country was more difficult. But again, one of his new friends helped us. She had a small house in the country, and Merrick could stay in it for the summer, she said.

I took Merrick to the country in a train with dark windows, so nobody could see him. Then we went in a cab to the country house.

There were a lot of trees near the house, but no people lived near it. A countryman brought food to the house every day, but no people came near it.

I stayed with him that night. At night, it was very dark and quiet. In the morning, hundreds of birds sang in the trees, and everything outside the house was green. Merrick walked under the big trees, looking at things happily, and singing his strange song.

I went back to London, but Merrick stayed there for six weeks. He was wonderfully happy. Every week, he wrote me a letter.

21st July 1889　　

Dear Dr Treves,

I had a wonderful day again today. It was very warm, so I walked under the trees and sat by a stream. The water in the stream made a beautiful noise, like singing. Did you know that? I listened to it for two hours.

Lots of little birds came near me. One had a red body in front, and a brown back. I gave it some bread, and it sat on my hand. A lot of birds are my friends, now.

I watched the fish in the stream, too. They were very exciting, because they move very fast. One minute they were there, and the next minute I couldn't see them. But I waited quietly, and they always came back. I put my hand in the water, but I couldn't touch them.

I met a big dog yesterday. It made a very loud noise, but I was not afraid. I sat down quietly and looked at it, and it came and smelt my hand. I saw it again today, and gave it some bread. It likes me now.

I am going to put some flowers from the country in this letter. There are hundreds of flowers here. Did you know that? I like the little blue ones best, but they are all beautiful. I have lots of them in my room. I give them water every morning. Little flowers are very thirsty, you know!

I am very happy here, doctor, but I want to see you again soon, too.

With love from your friend,

Joseph Merrick

At the end of the summer he came back to London. He was very well, and his skin looked much better. He talked about the country a lot, but he was happy to see his friends and his books again, too.

6 　在医院的外面

现在梅里克有了许多朋友，但是与其说他是一个男人，不如说他更像一个大男孩，他能通过阅读了解到许多事情，也能和他的来访者们交谈。但他不能一个人去到医院以外的地方。他像孩子一样思考和玩耍。

圣诞节后，他想去看戏。这是件很难办的事，因为我不愿剧院里的人们看到他。剧院有一位好心肠的肯德尔夫人帮助了我们，我们订了一个剧院里靠边上的包厢。我们乘坐窗户闭光的出租马车，从剧院后门——女王御用大门进去。没有人看到我们。

三个护士坐在包厢的前部，我和梅里克坐在她们后面的暗处。剧院里无人能看到我们，但我们可以清楚地观看演出。

这是一部儿童圣诞剧，梅里克喜欢看。这是一个极精彩并令人激动的故事。他常常笑出声来，有时也试着像剧中的孩子们一样歌唱，他像个孩子似的。在他看来，故事里的每件事都是真实的。

剧中有个坏蛋生气地拿着刀，梅里克一度害怕起来，要离开剧院，我拉住了他。他非常生那个坏蛋的气，用手击打着椅子，站起来骂那个坏蛋，但无人听见。当那个坏蛋被投进监狱时，梅里克大笑起来。

他觉得剧中那个漂亮的年轻姑娘非常可爱，他还想和她讲话。剧终时他很高兴，因为她与一个很好的年轻人结了婚。

他好长时间都没有忘记这出戏，他谈了许多有关剧中人的事。他问我：“我们离开以后他们怎么办？那个年轻人和那个姑娘在哪儿生活？现在他们在干什么？”

我说：“不知道，或许他们住在乡下。”

这件事梅里克想了很久。后来他问我：“特里夫斯医生，我可以到乡下去吗？我坐火车时曾看到过乡间，但我从来没去过那里。我在书上读到过有关乡间的事，很美，是不是？我想去看看。”

到剧场去都难，去乡下谈何容易。不过他的一位新朋友又一次给予了帮助。她在乡下有一座小房，她说梅里克可以在那儿避暑。

我带着梅里克乘一列窗户不透光的火车来到乡下，没有人看见我们。然后我们又换乘一辆出租马车来到这幢乡间小屋。

房子附近有许多树，但无人住在附近。除了一个村夫每天送食物过来，没有其他人来。

那天晚上我与他待在一起。晚上天很黑，也很安静。清晨，许多小鸟在树上歌唱，房子外面一片翠绿。梅里克在大树下散步，开心地欣赏着这里的一切，唱着他那奇怪的歌。

我回到了伦敦，梅里克在那儿又待了六个星期，他快活极了。每星期他都给我写一封信。

亲爱的特里夫斯医生：

今天我又过得愉快极了。天气非常暖和，我在树下散步，坐在小溪旁，溪水声优美动听，就像一曲美妙的音乐，您明白我的意思吗？你知道吗？我在这里已听了两个多小时。

许多小鸟儿飞到我的身旁，有一只鸟长着红身褐背。我给它吃面包，它站在我的手上。现在许多鸟已成了我的朋友。

我还看到溪水中的鱼。真令人惊奇，它们游得快极了，刚才还在那儿，一会儿又不见了。我静静地等着，它们总是又游回来。我把手伸进水里，可我摸不着它们。

昨天我碰见一只大狗，它大声地叫着，可我并不害怕。我坐下来静静地朝它看着，它走过来闻闻我的手。今天我又见到了它，还给它吃些面包，现在它很喜欢我。

我准备把乡下的花采摘一些放在信里寄给你，这里有好几百种花，你知道吗？我最喜欢这种小蓝花。不过，这儿所有的花都很好看，我摘了许多放在屋子里，我每天早上给这些花浇水，你知道，这些小花很渴！

大夫，我在这儿很愉快，但我也想尽快见到你。

非常热爱你的朋友 　　

约瑟夫·梅里克

夏季结束时他回到了伦敦。他非常健康，皮肤看上去也好多了。他讲了许多有关乡间的事情，但他也很高兴又见到了他的朋友和书。

Chapter 7

The Last Letter

Six months later, in April 1890, I found him dead in bed. He was on his back in bed, so at first I thought he was asleep. I talked to him, but he did not move. Then I saw that the skin on his face was blue, so I knew he was dead.

He did not usually sleep on his back. His enormous head was very heavy, so he usually sat up in bed with his arms round his legs, and his head on his knees. He could sleep well like this.

But he wanted to sleep on his back like you and me. He tried to sleep on his back that night, but his heavy head came off the bed, and he broke his neck. He died very quickly.

Next day, the Chairman of the London Hospital, Mr Carr Gomm, wrote to the editor of The Times again.

The Times, April 16th, 1890

Dear Sir,

Three and a half years ago I wrote to you about a man called Joseph Merrick. This man was called 'The Elephant Man' because he was born with a very ugly body. Merrick was not ill, but he could not work, and he had no money.

The readers of The Times felt sorry for him, and they gave me a lot of money for Merrick. Because of this money, we could give Merrick a home in the London Hospital. It was his first good home, and for three and a half years he lived here happily. The doctors and nurses of the hospital helped him, and many important people visited him. He read many books, he went to the theatre, and in the summer he stayed in the country for six weeks. Because of your readers' money, we could give him a happy life.

Last night Joseph Merrick died quietly in his bed. He was a man with a very ugly body, but he was a good, kind man, and he had a lot of friends. We liked to talk to him, and we are all very sorry because he is dead. A lot of people are going to remember him for a long time.

There is some money left, so I am going to give it to the hospital. Thank you, sir, for your help.

Yours faithfully,

F. C. Carr Gomm

Chairman of the London Hospital

7 　最后一封信

过了六个月，也就是1890年4月，我发现他死在床上。他仰面朝天地躺在床上，开始我以为他睡着了，我跟他说话他不动，后来我见他脸上的皮肤发青，才知道他死了。

他通常不能躺着睡觉，因为他的脑袋又大又重，所以他通常坐在床上，用手抱着腿，把头放在膝盖上，这样他能睡得很好。

可是他也想像你我这样躺着睡觉。那天晚上他试着躺下来睡，结果他那个庞大的头跌下床，折断了脖子。他很快就死了。

第二天伦敦医院院长卡尔·戈姆又给《泰晤士报》的编辑写了一封信。

摘自1890年4月16日的《泰晤士报》

亲爱的先生：

三年半以前我写信给你介绍了一个名叫约瑟夫·梅里克的男人，这个人被叫做“象人”，他天生有一个丑陋的身躯。梅里克没有病，但他不能工作，也没有钱。

《泰晤士报》的读者们很同情他，给了他许多钱。有了这些钱，我们可以在伦敦医院里给他安个家，这是他的第一个舒适的家。三年半以来他一直在这里生活得很幸福，医院里的医生和护士都帮助他，许多要人来拜访他。他读了许多书，去看过戏，在乡间避暑待了六个星期。有了读者们给的钱，我们把他的生活安排得很幸福。

昨天晚上约瑟夫·梅里克在床上静静地死去了。他是一个很丑的人，但是很好、很善良，他有许多朋友。我们都喜欢与他交谈，我们都为他的死感到很遗憾。许多人会永远记着他的。

现在还剩下一些钱，我准备把这些钱捐给医院。感谢你的帮助。

你忠实的 　　

伦敦医院院长F. C. 卡尔·戈姆

当今，南极有一座房子，叫阿蒙森—斯科特南极站。室内暖融融的，无论夏冬，人们都可以在那儿生活、工作。飞机毫不费力地便能飞抵或是飞离南极站。从这儿到世界其他地方，要不了多少小时。但是从南极站出来走上500米，那儿的南极洲便再次成为地球上最寒冷、最空旷的地区。

在1911年，当时的南极既没见过飞机也没建有住房。除了茫茫大雪、冰封天地与凛凛寒风外，一无所有。没有英国国旗，没有挪威国旗。但是，有几个人缓慢地向南走着，横穿冰封大地。斯科特率领的人配备了小马，而阿蒙森率领的人配备了狗与滑雪板。当时的温度为-30℃或者更糟。这些人忍受着疲倦、饥饿和寒冷……他们中谁将是到达南极的第一人呢？

目前，在阿蒙森—斯科特南极站内墙上写着一些字，是斯科特队长于1912年写在日记里的一句话：

“天啊，这地方太可怕了！”

Chapter 1

Two Ships

The race began in the summer of 1910.

On June 1st, in London, a black ship, the Terra Nova , went down the river Thames to the sea. Thousands of people stood by the river to watch it. They were all excited and happy.

On the Terra Nova , Captain Robert Falcon Scott smiled quietly. It was a very important day for him. He was a strong man, not very tall, in the blue clothes of a captain. He was forty-one years old, but he had a young face, like a boy. His eyes were dark and quiet.

One man on the ship, Titus Oates, smiled at Scott.

'What an exciting day, Captain!' he said. 'Look at those people! I feel like an important man!'

Scott laughed. 'You are important, Titus,' he said. 'And you're going to be famous, too. We all are. Do you see this flag?' He looked at the big British flag at the back of the ship, and smiled at Oates. 'That flag is coming with us,' he said. 'In the Antarctic, I'm going to carry it under my clothes. We're going to be the first men at the South Pole, and that flag is going to be first, too!'

*　*　*　*　*

Five days later, on June 6th, a man opened the door of his wooden house in Norway. He was a tall man, with a long face. He waited outside the house for a minute. Everything was very quiet. He could see no houses, only mountains, trees, and water. It was nearly dark. The sky was black over the mountains.

The man smiled, and walked quickly away from the house, down to the sea. In the water, a big wooden ship waited for him. The man got onto the ship, and talked and laughed quietly with his friends.

The ship's name was Fram , and the man was Roald Amundsen. The Fram was the most beautiful ship on earth, Amundsen thought. His friends were the best skiers on earth, too. One of them, Olav Bjaaland, smiled at him.

'North Pole, here we come, Captain,' he said.

'Yes.' Amundsen said. His friends could not see his face in the dark. 'Fram is going to the Arctic.'

Everyone on the Fram was ready to go to the North Pole, to the Arctic. Amundsen wanted to go there, too. But first he wanted to go south. His friends didn't know that.

At midnight on June 6th, the Fram moved quietly away from Amundsen's house, out to sea.

比赛开始于1910年夏天。

6月1日，伦敦。特若·诺瓦号这艘黑色的轮船顺泰晤士河而下，向大海驶去。成千上万的人伫立岸边观望，所有的人都非常喜悦和兴奋。

特若·诺瓦号上，队长罗伯特·福尔康·斯科特无声地笑了。这一天对他来说太重要了。他个头不高，但长得壮实，穿着蓝色的队长制服。他虽说已经41岁，但是由于长着一张娃娃脸，所以看上去仍像个小孩。他双眼乌黑而又沉静。

泰特斯·奥茨，船上的一位水手，冲着队长笑了。

“多么令人兴奋的日子啊，队长！”他说，“看看这些人！我觉得自己好像一个重要人物！”

队长朗声笑了。“泰特斯，你的确是重要人物，”他说，“而且你很快就要名扬天下，就同我们大家一样。你看到这国旗了吗？”他注视着船尾那面巨幅的英国国旗，微笑着对奥茨说：“那面国旗将会随我们一道去。在南极洲，我将把它夹在衣服里面带着。我们将成为首批到达南极的人，那面国旗也将是第一面到达南极的旗帜。”

5天以后，6月6日。在挪威，一个人拉开了自己的木房子的门。这人高个、长脸。他在室外稍候了片刻，四周万籁俱寂。他目光所及之处，没有住房，只有群山、树林和大海。天近傍晚，群山之上是黑沉沉的一片天空。

这人脸上露出微笑，快步离开木屋，朝海边走去。大海中，一艘大型木船正等着他。他来到船上，与朋友们聊着，轻声地笑着。

这船叫弗雷门号，这人便是罗阿尔·阿蒙森。阿蒙森认为，弗雷门号是地球上最美丽的一艘船。他的朋友是地球上最优秀的滑雪者。其中有位叫奥拉夫·比阿兰德的朋友，正冲着他微笑。

“北极，我们去那儿，队长。”他说。

“是的，”阿蒙森说。由于天色已黑，这位朋友看不见他的面部表情。“弗雷门号正驶向北极。”

弗雷门号上的每个人全都准备就绪：到北极圈，上北极。阿蒙森也想去那儿。然而他第一想做的事，便是向南航行，而他的朋友却毫不知情。

6月6日午夜，弗雷门号无声地驶离阿蒙森的家园，驶向大海。

The Race

The Fram went to an island in the south of Norway. It was a very little island, with only one small wooden house, two trees—and nearly a hundred dogs.

'Look at that!' Bjaaland said. 'It's an island of dogs! There are dogs in the water, near the trees, on the house—dogs everywhere!'

Two men came out of the house. 'Hassel! Lindstrøm!' Amundsen said. 'It's good to see you! How many dogs do you have for me?'

'Ninety-nine, Roald,' said Hassel. 'The best ninety-nine dogs from Greenland. And they're very happy! They don't work; they just eat and play all day! They're having a wonderful summer here!'

'Good, good.' Amundsen laughed. 'But that's finished now. Hey, Bjaaland! Stop laughing—come down here and help me. Let's get all these dogs onto the ship!'

It was not easy. The dogs were fat and strong, and they didn't want to go on the ship. But at last, after three hours' hard work, all ninety-nine were on the ship, and the Fram went out to sea again.

The men were not happy. The weather was bad, the dogs were dirty, and some of the men were ill. They began to ask questions.

'Why are we bringing dogs with us?' asked one man, Johansen. 'We're going thousands of kilometres south, past Cape Horn, and then north to Alaska. Why not wait, and get dogs in Alaska?'

'Don't ask me,' said his friend, Helmer Hanssen, 'I don't understand it.'

The men talked for a long time. Then, on September 9th, Amundsen called everyone to the back of the ship. He stood quietly and looked at them. Behind him was a big map. It was not a map of the Arctic. It was a map of Antarctica.

Bjaaland looked at Helmer Hanssen, and laughed. Then Amundsen began to speak.

'Boys,' he said. 'I know you are unhappy. You often ask me difficult questions, and I don't answer. Well, I'm going to answer all those questions now, today.'

'We began to work for this journey two years ago. Then, we wanted to be the first men at the North Pole. But last year, Peary, an American, found the North Pole. So America was first to the North Pole, not Norway. We're going there, but we're too late.'

'I don't understand this,' Bjaaland thought. 'Why is Amundsen talking about the North Pole, with a map of Antarctica behind him?'

Amundsen stopped for a minute, and looked at all the men slowly. No one said anything.

'We have to go a long way south before we get to Alaska,' he said. 'Very near Antarctica, you know. And Captain Scott, the Englishman, is going to the South Pole this year. He wants to put his British flag there. An American flag at the North Pole, a British flag at the South Pole.'

Bjaaland began to understand. He started to smile and couldn't stop. He was warm and excited.

'Well, boys,' Amundsen said slowly. 'Do we want the British to put their flag at the South Pole first? How fast can we travel? We have a lot of dogs, and some of the most wonderful skiers on earth—Bjaaland here is the best in Norway! So I have an idea, boys. Let's go to the South Pole, and put the Norwegian flag there before the British! What do you say?'

For a minute or two it was very quiet. Amundsen waited, and the men watched him and thought. Then Bjaaland laughed.

'Yes!' he said. 'Why not? It's a ski race, isn't it, and the English can't ski! It's a wonderful idea, of course! Let's go!'

2 　比赛

弗雷门号抵达挪威南部的一个小岛。该岛很小，仅有一间小木屋，两棵树，还有将近100条狗。

“看那儿！”比阿兰德说，“是座狗岛！海水里有狗，树旁有狗，房顶上有狗，到处都有狗！”

房内走出两个人。“哈塞尔！林德斯特伦！”阿蒙森打招呼，“见到你们真好！你们给我养了多少条狗？”

“99条，罗阿尔，”哈塞尔说，“99条格陵兰最好的狗。这些狗过得太好了，啥事不干，整天好吃好玩！它们正在这儿欢度夏天呢！”

“好，好，”阿蒙森朗声笑了，“但是现在这一切结束了。喂，比阿兰德！别笑啦，下船来这儿，帮帮我，把这些狗全弄到船上去！”

这事并不容易。这些狗又肥又壮，不愿上船。然而在苦干3小时后，所有99条狗全都上了船，弗雷门号再度驶向大海。

船上的人员却高兴不起来：气候恶劣，狗群肮脏，而且有人病倒了。于是，他们便开始提出种种问题。

“我们为什么要带这些狗？”有人提问说，他叫约翰森。“我们即将南行好几千公里，穿越合恩角，然后向北，到阿拉斯加。为什么不等等，等到阿拉斯加后再弄狗？”

“别问我，”他的朋友赫尔默·汉森说，“我也搞不懂。”

好长时间内，这些人一直都在议论纷纷。后来，9月9日那天，阿蒙森将所有人员召集到大船尾部。他静静地站着，看着众人。他身后有一大幅地图，然而这不是北极地图，而是南极洲地图。

比阿兰德看着赫尔默·汉森，笑出声来。这时，阿蒙森开始讲话。

“伙计们，”他说，“我知道你们心中不满。你们经常问我一些难题，我都没有回答。好吧，今天我当即解答所有的问题。”

“两年前，我们便开始为这次旅程做准备。当时，我们想成为最先抵达北极的人。然而去年，美国人皮里找到了北极。所以，美国人首先到达了北极，而不是挪威人。我们现在正要去那儿，但为时过晚了。”

“我听不懂这些话，”比阿兰德心想，“阿蒙森身后挂着南极洲地图，为什么却大谈北极呢？”

阿蒙森稍作停顿，缓缓地看着全体人员。这时没有任何人多嘴。

“到阿拉斯加前，还得南行好远的路，”他说，“你们都知道，几乎是到了南极洲。英国人斯科特队长今年正赶往南极。他想将英国国旗插在那儿。美国国旗已经插上了北极，而英国国旗正插向南极。”

比阿兰德开始省悟了，脸上露出了微笑，难以自制。他浑身暖洋洋的，亢奋不已。

“好吧，伙计们，”阿蒙森缓缓地说，“眼睁睁地看着英国人将他们的旗帜首先插上南极，我们能同意吗？我们的前行速度非常之快，不是吗？我们不仅带着许多狗，而且拥有地球上最杰出的滑雪能手：我们这儿的比阿兰德便是全挪威最优秀的！所以，我有个主意，伙计们。咱们到南极去，赶在英国之前，将挪威国旗插到那儿去！你们有何看法？”

一时间，整个场面安静极了。阿蒙森等待着，而这些人看着他，思考着。这时，比阿兰德朗笑出声。

“对！”他说，“为什么不呢？这是场滑雪比赛，难道不是吗？再说，英国人不会滑雪！这主意绝妙之极！咱们就去那儿！”

The Ponies

On October 27th, the Terra Nova arrived in Wellington, New Zealand. When Scott came off the ship, a newspaper man walked up to him.

'Captain Scott! Captain Scott! Can I talk to you, please!' he said.

Scott stopped and smiled. 'Yes, of course,' he said. 'What do you want to know?'

'Are you going to win?' the man asked.

'Win?' Scott asked. 'Win what?'

'Win the race to the South Pole, of course,' the newspaper man said. 'It's a race between you and Amundsen, now. Look at this!' He gave a newspaper to Scott. Scott looked at it. It said:

Scott's face went white. 'Give me that!' he said. He took the newspaper and read it carefully. The newspaper man watched him, and waited. 'Well, Captain Scott,' he said at last. 'Who's going to win this race? Tell me that!'

Scott looked at him angrily. 'This is stupid!' he said. 'It's not a race! I came here to learn about the Antarctic—I'm not interested in Amundsen, or in races!' Then he walked back onto his ship, with the newspaper in his hand.

Later that day, he talked to his men. He gave them the newspaper, and laughed.

'It doesn't matter,' he said. 'We're in front of Amundsen, and we have more men, and more money. He has only eight men, and a lot of dogs. I know about dogs—they don't work in the Antarctic. We have sixteen men and the new motor sledges—they are much better. And tomorrow the ponies are coming. We need ponies, motor sledges, and good strong British men—that's all. Forget about Amundsen! He's not important!'

Scott asked Oates to look after the ponies, but he did not let Oates buy them. When Oates first saw the ponies, in New Zealand, he was very unhappy. Most of the ponies were old, and some of them were ill.

'They're beautiful ponies, Titus,' Scott said. 'They come from China—they're wonderful ponies!'

Oates looked at them angrily, and said nothing. Then he asked: 'Where is their food, Captain?'

'Here!' Scott opened a door.

Oates looked inside. He thought for a minute. 'We need more food than this, Captain Scott! These ponies are going to work in the coldest place on earth—they need a lot of food—more than this!'

Scott smiled quietly. 'We can't take more food on this ship, Titus. Where can we put it? But it doesn't matter, old boy. They're very strong ponies, you know. The best ponies on earth.'

Later that night, Oates wrote a letter to his mother. There are nineteen ponies on the Terra Nova now , he wrote. All the ponies are in a small room at the front of the ship. We eat our food in the room under the ponies, so our table is often wet and dirty. Scott makes a lot of mistakes, I think, and Antarctica is a very dangerous place.

3 　小马

10月27日，特若·诺瓦号船抵达了新西兰的惠灵顿。当斯科特走下船时，一位报社记者迎面走来。

“斯科特队长！斯科特队长！我能与你谈谈吗？”他说。

斯科特停下来，面带微笑。“行，当然可以！”他说，“你想知道什么？”

“你们会是赢家吗？”那人问。

“赢家？”斯科特问，“什么赢家？”

“当然是赢得前往南极的竞赛。”报社记者说，“现在这个竞赛在你与阿蒙森之间展开。瞧！”他将一份报纸递给斯科特。斯科特看到报上是这样写的：

弗雷门号正与斯科特争先向南极进军

阿蒙森说：“我们将赢得比赛！”

阿蒙森说：“我们将赢得比赛！”

斯科特脸色变得苍白。“给我报纸！”他说。他拿过报纸认真阅读。记者观察着他，期待着。“那么，斯科特队长，”他最终开口了，“谁将赢得这场比赛？请告诉我！”

斯科特愤怒地看着他。“真是愚蠢！”他说，“这不是比赛！我来这儿是为了了解南极。我对阿蒙森对比赛都不感兴趣！”然后，他回到船上，手里拿着那张报纸。

当天晚些时候，他对同行人员讲起这事，他将报纸递给他们，然后大笑起来。

“没关系，”他说，“我们现今还在阿蒙森前面。我们不仅人数占优势，而且钱也更多。他呢，除了许多狗外，只有8个人。我熟悉狗性：它们在南极洲干不了活儿。我们有16个人，还配有新式机动雪橇。这些雪橇比狗好使多了。明天，还有小马送来。我们需要小马、机动雪橇以及身强力壮的英国人！这些就够了。忘了那个阿蒙森！他并不重要！”

斯科特分配奥茨喂养小马，但不让他负责买马。在新西兰的时候，奥茨一见到这些小马，便大为光火。这些小马大部分都已老态毕呈，有些还是病马。

“这些都是漂亮的小马，泰特斯，”斯科特说，“纯中国货，匹匹都极为出色！”

奥茨恼火地看着这些小马，没有说什么。随即他问：“队长，它们的饲料在哪里？”

“这儿！”斯科特打开一道门。

奥茨朝里看了看，思索了一会儿。“我们需要更多饲料，斯科特队长！这些小马将在地球上最冷的地区干活儿：它们需要许多饲料，远不止这些！”

斯科特无声地笑了。“这条船上，我们不可能带许多饲料，泰特斯。往哪放呢？没什么关系，老兄。你看见了，这些马十分壮实，是地球上最好的小马。”

那天深夜，奥茨给他母亲写了封信。信是这样写的：特若·诺瓦号船上现在有19匹小马，所有小马都养在船首的小舱里。我们进餐的地方正好位于装运小马的船舱下面。所以我们的餐桌经常湿漉漉、脏兮兮的。我认为，斯科特犯了许多错误。南极洲其实是一个非常危险的地方。

Chapter 4

Food Depots

The two ships, Terra Nova and Fram , arrived in Antarctica, in January 1911, at the end of summer. The Englishmen and the Norwegians wanted to stay on the ice all winter. They wanted to be ready to go to the South Pole at the beginning of the next Antarctic summer.

The dogs pulled the Norwegians' sledges. They ran quickly over the snow and pulled the big sledges from the ship onto the ice. The men ran beside them on skis.

They put a big wooden house on the ice. The house was full of food, and skis, and sledges. They called it Framheim. Outside the house, the dogs lived in holes under the snow. When the house was ready, the men made their first journey south.

Before the winter, they wanted to take a lot of food south, and leave it in depots. For the long journey to the Pole, they needed a lot of food, and they couldn't carry it all with them. On February 10th, five men, three sledges, eighteen dogs, and half a tonne of food left Framheim and went south.

It was easy. The weather was warm for the Antarctic, between -7° Centigrade and -17° Centigrade. The snow was good, and the dogs and skis went fast. They went fifty or sixty kilometres every day. After four days they reached 80° South, and made the first depot.

Amundsen made his depot very carefully. It was very important to find it again, next summer. So he put a big black flag on top. Then he put ten flags to the east of the depot—each flag half a kilometre from the next—and ten flags to the west. So there were flags for five kilometres to the left of the depot, and five kilometres to the right.

Then they went back to Framheim, and took some more food south, this time to 82° South.

This time it was harder. The temperature was sometimes -40° Centigrade, and there were strong winds with a lot of snow. The dogs and men were very tired, and the tents and boots were bad. At the second depot, they put out sixty flags, to help them find it again.

They came back to Framheim on March 23rd. It was nearly winter in the Antarctic. Their ship Fram was far away now, near South America. They were alone on the ice.

*　*　*　*　*

Oates went with Scott to make the first British depot. They left Cape Evans on January 25th. There were thirteen men, eight ponies, and twenty-six dogs. The dogs were faster than the ponies—they ran quickly over the top of the snow, but the ponies' feet went through it. Every morning the ponies started first, and the dogs started two hours later, because they ran faster. At night, the dogs made warm holes under the snow, but the ponies stood on top of the snow. It was -20° Centigrade.

After fifteen days Oates talked to Scott. There was a strong wind, and the two men's faces were white with snow.

'Three of the ponies are ill, Captain,' Oates said. 'They can't go on.'

'Don't be stupid, Oates,' Scott answered. 'They're good strong animals—the best ponies on earth.'

'Not these three,' Oates said. 'They're ill, and unhappy, and now they can't walk. Let's kill them, and leave the meat here, in the snow. We can eat it, or the dogs can.'

'Of course not!' Scott said angrily. 'These ponies are our friends, they work hard for us. I don't kill my friends!'

Three days later, two of the ponies were dead.

Scott's men were slower than Amundsen's; it took them twenty-four days to get to 80° South. They made a big depot there, and put one large black flag on top of it. Then they went back to Cape Evans.

Their camp was on an island in the ice, and the sea ice moved sometimes. There were holes in the ice, and black sea water under it. One day seven ponies went through the ice into the sea, and died. One motor sledge also went into the sea.

4 　食品贮藏屋

两艘船，特若·诺瓦号与弗雷门号都抵达南极洲，时间为1911年1月，夏末。英国人与挪威人均想在这冰封的天地里度过整个冬天。他们都想做好准备工作，以求第二年夏天刚开始时能向南极进军。

群狗拉着挪威人的雪橇，在雪地上高速奔跑，将从船上卸下来的大雪橇拉到了冰面上。众人踩着滑雪板在一旁滑行。

他们在冰封世界上建起一座大木屋。屋子里堆满了食品、滑雪板以及雪橇。他们将这木屋称作弗雷门海姆。木屋外，群狗住在雪下挖出的狗洞里。当木屋准备就绪时，他们开始了首次南行的征途。

在冬天来临之前，他们打算向南方运许多食物，并将食物放到各个贮藏屋里。因为在奔赴南极的漫长旅程中，他们需要许多食物。他们不可能随身带着所有的食物！2月10日，5个人、3辆雪橇、18条狗、以及半吨食物离开了弗雷门海姆，向南行进。

事情进行得颇为顺利。此时的南极气候相对来说还算暖和，介于-7℃与-17℃之间。地面的雪利于行进，狗与雪橇也都跑得很快，每天能走五六十公里。4天之后，他们到达了南纬80°的地方，建起了第一个贮藏屋。

阿蒙森非常精心地修建他的贮藏屋。第二年夏天需要再度找到它，这点特别重要。所以，他在贮藏屋顶上插上一面黑旗。随后他在贮藏屋的东边插上10面旗帜：每半公里插一面；在贮藏屋西边也插上10面旗帜。所以，从贮藏屋向左5公里和向右5公里都有旗帜。

随后，他们返回弗雷门海姆，带上更多的食品后，再度南行。这次抵达了南纬82°的地方。

这次旅程辛苦多了。温度有时低达-40℃。寒风凛冽，雪花漫天。人困狗乏，帐篷与靴子也不顶事了。在第二个贮藏屋附近，他们插了60面旗，目的是帮助他们能再次找到它。

他们再度回到弗雷门海姆时，已是3月23日。这时南极时近冬天。他们的弗雷门号船早已远去，现在到了南美洲附近。只有他们孤独地留在冰封的天地里。

*　*　*　*　*

奥茨跟随斯科特，前往修建第一座英国人的贮藏屋。他们于1月25日离开了开普埃文斯。一行13人、8匹小马、26条狗。这些狗比小马要快：它们能够在雪地上快速地奔跑，但是马腿却要陷进雪里。每天早晨，都是小马首先出发。2小时后，狗儿们才上路，因为它们奔跑速度快些。夜里，狗躲进挖在雪下面的温暖的洞里，但是小马只能站在雪地上，承受着-20℃的气温。

15天后，奥茨向斯科特请示。当时的寒风强劲，两人脸上都沾上一层白雪。

“队长，有3匹小马病了，”奥茨说，“走不动了。”

“别犯傻了，奥茨，”斯科特回答说，“它们都是强壮的好畜牲，地球上最好的小马。”

“这3匹不是，”奥茨说，“它们病歪歪的，无精打采。现在它们根本无法走路。杀了它们吧，将肉留在这儿的雪里。这样我们可以吃，或者让狗吃。”

“绝对不行！”斯科特生气地说，“这些小马是我们的朋友，它们拼命地为我们干活儿。我可不想杀掉自己的朋友！”

3天后，其中有2匹小马死了。

斯科特的人比阿蒙森的人动作慢。他们花了24天才抵达南纬80°地区。他们在那儿修建了一个大贮藏屋，在棚顶上插了一面大黑旗。然后，他们返回开普埃文斯。

他们的营地构筑在冰上的一个小岛上，海冰有时还会移动。冰层中还有些空洞，可以看到冰下的黑色海水。一天，7匹小马从冰窟中掉进海里，死了。还有一辆机动雪橇也掉进了海里。

Chapter 5

A Long Cold Winter

It was dark for four months. Outside the wooden house at Framheim, it was often -60° Centigrade. The dogs lived in warm holes under the snow. The men stayed in the house, and worked in their rooms under the snow.

The skis and sledges came from the best shops in Norway, but Bjaaland wasn't happy with them. He changed a lot of things on the skis and sledges. Soon the sledges were stronger than before. The skis were better and faster, too.

All the Norwegians worked hard. They looked after their dogs, and worked on their equipment—the sledges, skis, tents. Every day they thought about their journey to the Pole, and talked about it. And every day, Amundsen thought about Scott. One day, in midwinter, he talked to his men.

'Let's start early, before Scott,' Amundsen said. 'Remember, Scott has more men than us, and he has motor sledges, too. Perhaps they can go faster than us.'

Bjaaland laughed. 'Oh no, they can't go faster than me,' he said. 'On snow, nothing can go faster than a good man on skis.'

'We don't know,' Amundsen said. 'You're the best skier in Norway, but you get tired, and dogs get tired, too. Motor sledges don't get tired. They can go all day and all night.'

Johansen laughed angrily. 'That's stupid,' he said. 'Perhaps the motor sledges can go all night, but the Englishmen can't. The English can't win, Roald—they don't understand snow, but we do. And they're too slow.'

'Perhaps,' Amundsen said. 'But I want to win this race. So we're going to start early! Do you understand?'

It was quiet and warm inside Framheim. Bjaaland looked at Amundsen, and thought about the long, cold journey in front of him. He thought about the dogs in their holes under the snow, and listened to the wind over the house. 'When, Roald?' he said quietly.

'On August 24th. The sun comes back on that day. We start then.'

'But we can't!' Johansen said. He looked angry, and unhappy. 'That's too early! We can't start then—it's dangerous and stupid!'

Amundsen looked at Johansen coldly. 'You're wrong, Johansen,' he said. 'We want to win, remember? So we start on August 24th.'

Bjaaland listened to the winter wind outside.

*　*　*　*　*

In Scott's camp, at Cape Evans, no one talked about Amundsen and no one worked hard. They had good food, and they played football on the snow. They wrote a newspaper—The South Polar Times —and read books. No one learnt to ski, no one worked on the motor sledges. Twice, men went for long journeys across the snow. They walked, and pulled the sledges themselves. Oates stayed at Cape Evans and looked after his ponies.

Over the window in Cape Evans, Scott put a map of Antarctica. With a pen, he made a line from Cape Evans to the South Pole, and he put a little British Flag at the Pole. Under the map, Scott wrote the day for the start of their journey.

We start on November 3rd, he wrote.

5 　漫长的寒冬

4个月中不见天日，一片昏暗。在弗雷门海姆木屋外面，气温低到-60℃。狗儿们生活在温暖的雪洞里。众人则留在木屋里，在白雪覆盖下的房间里，忙着各自的活儿。

尽管滑雪板与雪橇都是从挪威最好的商店购买的，但是比阿兰德对这些设备并不满意。于是，他给滑雪板与雪橇换了许多部件。很快雪橇变得结实多了。滑雪板变得更好更快了。

所有这些挪威人干活儿都很卖力。他们照顾狗群，改良雪橇、滑雪板、帐篷等设备。每天，他们都想着谈论着远赴南极的旅程。每天，阿蒙森脑子里都装着斯科特。隆冬里的一天，他对众人说：

“我们早些走，赶在斯科特之前。”阿蒙森说，“别忘了，斯科特的人比我们多，他还有机动雪橇。所以，他们可能比我们快。”

比阿兰德大笑起来。“啊，不，他们不可能比我快，”他说，“在雪地上，没有任何东西能快过优秀的滑雪者。”

“很难料定。”阿蒙森说，“你虽是挪威最优秀的滑雪者，但是也有疲惫的时候，狗也一样。而机动雪橇则不会累，它能整日整夜地跑个不停。”

约翰森怒极而笑。“真蠢，”他说，“也许机动雪橇可以整夜不停地跑，但是英国人不能啊！英国人不可能赢，罗阿尔。他们不懂雪性，而我们懂。况且他们行进速度非常缓慢。”

“也许如此，”阿蒙森说，“无论如何我想赢得这次竞赛，所以我们要早些出发！你们理解吗？”

弗雷门海姆的房内宁静而温暖。比阿兰德看着阿蒙森，思考起摆在面前漫长寒冷的旅程，想着那些躲在雪洞里的狗儿们，听着屋外的寒风。“什么时候出发，罗阿尔？”他轻声地问。

“8月24日，从那天起太阳就又要回归了。我们就在那时出发。”

“我们不能那时就出发！”约翰森说。他显得很生气，一脸不快。“这太早了！我们不能在那个时候出发，那是危险而愚蠢的做法！”

阿蒙森冷冷地看着约翰森。“你错了，约翰森，”他说，“别忘了，我们想取得胜利。所以，我们的出发时间为8月24日。”

比阿兰德聆听着窗外的寒风。

*　*　*　*　*

开普埃文斯，斯科特的营地里，没有任何人谈论起阿蒙森的情况，没有任何人在努力地干活儿。他们吃好东西，在雪地上踢足球，编了一份定名为《南极时报》的报纸，看书。没有人学滑雪，也没有人保养机动雪橇。这些人两度进行过横穿雪原的漫长旅程。他们步行，还拉着雪橇走。奥茨留在开普埃文斯，喂养小马。

在开普埃文斯的窗户上，斯科特挂着一张南极洲地图。他在开普埃文斯与南极之间，用钢笔划了条线，并将一面小小的英国国旗插在南极上。地图下面，斯科特写下了他们的出发日期。

我们于11月3日出发 ，他写道。

Chapter 6

A Bad Start

On August 23rd, the Norwegians' sledges were ready. They took them outside, and the dogs pulled them across the ice. The sun came up for half an hour, but it was too cold: -46° Centigrade. They could not travel in that weather. They went back to Framheim and waited.

They waited two weeks, until September 8th. Then, with the temperature at -37° Centigrade, they started. They ran happily across the snow to the south—eight men, seven sledges, and eighty-six dogs. Only Lindstrøm, the cook, stayed behind in Framheim.

At first everything went well. They went twenty-eight kilometres on Saturday, and twenty-eight kilometres on Sunday. It was easy. Then, on Monday, the temperature went down—to -56° Centigrade. There was white fog in front of their faces. They couldn't see anything. But they travelled twenty-eight kilometres.

That night, in their tents, they nearly died of cold. Next day, they stopped and made snow houses. Inside the snow houses, it was warm. But everyone was unhappy.

'I told you, Roald!' Johansen said. 'Even September is too early! We can't travel in this cold. Do you want us to die? Let's go back and wait for better weather.'

Amundsen was very angry. He was angry with Johansen, but he was angry with himself, too. He knew Johansen was right.

'All right,' he said slowly. 'We can go on to the depot at 80° South, leave the food there, and then go back. We can't do more than that.'

It was thirty-seven kilometres to the depot. The wind was in their faces all day. Two dogs died on the way. At the depot, they did not stop. They put out the food and the flags, turned round, and went north.

At last the wind was behind them. The dogs ran quickly, and the men sat on the empty sledges. They went faster and faster. It was like a race. Amundsen was on Wisting's sledge, and soon he, Wisting, and Hanssen were three or four kilometres in front. Soon they were alone. They travelled seventy-five kilometres in nine hours, and they reached Framheim at four o'clock that afternoon.

Bjaaland arrived two hours later, with two more men. But the last two—Johansen and Prestrud—went more slowly. Their dogs were tired, their feet were wet and cold, they had no food, and they were alone in the dark. The temperature was -51° Centigrade. They reached Framheim at midnight.

Next morning, Johansen was angry. In front of everyone, he said: 'You were wrong, Roald. September was too early. I told you but you didn't listen. And then you left us alone and we nearly died in the cold! You're a bad captain—I'm a better captain than you are!'

Amundsen was very angry. But at first he said nothing, because he knew that Johansen was right. Then, that evening, he gave a letter to Johansen. It said:

You aren't coming to the Pole with me. When I go south, you can take some dogs and go east to King Edward Ⅶ Land. You can go with Prestrud and Stubberud. You can be the first men to go there—but not to the South Pole!

The Norwegians stayed in Framheim and waited. They lay in bed, listened to the wind outside, and thought about Scott and his motor sledges.

6 　出师不利

8月23日，挪威人的雪橇准备就绪。他们将雪橇搬到户外，狗拉着雪橇穿行在冰封的大地上。太阳已升起半小时，但是气候仍旧很冷：-46℃。他们不可能在这种天气上路，只好返回弗雷门海姆等待着。

他们又等了两个星期，直至9月8日。他们冒着-37℃的低温，出发了。他们愉快地向南奔去，穿行在雪原之中。这一行共有8个人、7辆雪橇、86条狗。留在身后的只有厨师林德斯特伦，他留守在弗雷门海姆营地。

起初一切顺利。星期六他们走了28公里，星期天又走了28公里。事情并不难。然而在星期一，温度降到-56℃。眼前是一片白茫茫的浓雾，他们啥也看不到。即使如此，他们还是前进了28公里。

那天晚上，他们几乎冻死在帐篷里。第二天，他们停了下来，修筑雪屋。尽管雪屋内暖融融的，但是众人的心都很沉重。

“我给你讲过，罗阿尔！”约翰森说，“即使9月份也为时过早！在这种寒冷的天气下，我们不可能前行。你要我们死吗？咱们回去吧，等气候变好些再走。”

阿蒙森恼怒至极。他不仅恼恨约翰森，而且还恼恨自己。他心中明白，约翰森是对的。

“好吧，”他缓缓地说，“我们可以继续前行，到南纬80°的贮藏屋去，把食物留在那儿后，再折回。我们只能做这些事了。”

离贮藏屋有37公里。寒风扑面，整日不歇，有两条狗死在半路了。到达贮藏屋时，他们没做任何停留，取出食物与旗帜后，马上向北调头了。

他们终于将寒风抛在身后。群狗飞快地跑，众人坐在空雪橇上往回赶。它们速度越来越快，就像进行比赛。阿蒙森坐在威斯丁的雪橇上。很快地，他、威斯丁、汉森就领先了三四公里。再一会儿后，他们已经独领风骚了。9小时内，他们跑了75公里。他们到达弗雷门海姆时，是那天下午4点钟。

两小时后，比阿兰德与另外两个人赶了回来。但是约翰森与普雷斯楚德两人速度更慢。他们的狗非常疲倦。两个人的脚又湿又冷。他们的食品也光了，孤独地行进在黑暗之中。当时的气温降到-51℃。他们赶回弗雷门海姆时已经是半夜了。

次日早晨，约翰森大发其火。他当着众人说：“你错了，罗阿尔。9月份太早了。我早告诉过你，可是你听不进去。后来，你又扔下我们，搞得我们孤立无援，几乎冻死在这冰天雪地之中。你是个坏队长，让我当队长也比你强。”

阿蒙森愤怒至极，但刚开始他一言不发，因为他知道约翰森骂得有理。后来，在那天晚上，他递给约翰森一封信。信中这样写：

你不必随我去南极了。在我出发南行之时，你可以带几条狗向东，赶到爱德华七世地。普雷斯楚德与斯塔伯鲁德也可以随你同去。你们可能成为首批到那儿的人——但不是南极！

这些挪威人留在弗雷门海姆，等待着。他们躺在床上，听着屋外的寒风，想着斯科特，想着他的机动雪橇。

Chapter 7

Motor Sledges and Mountains

Scott had two motor sledges now. They were the first motor sledges in the Antarctic—the first on earth. On October 24th, the motor sledges started south from Cape Evans. Four men went with them, but Scott stayed at Cape Evans for another week.

Oates was unhappy. He wrote to his mother: We had a very bad winter here. I don't like Scott. We were here all winter, but he didn't learn to ski, or to drive dogs. Our equipment is bad, and he doesn't think about other people. I'm going to sleep in his tent on the journey, but I don't want to.

On November 1st Scott and Oates and six more men left Cape Evans with eight sledges and eight ponies. The ponies walked slowly because their feet went down into the snow. It was hard work for them and they got tired very quickly. They travelled thirteen or fourteen kilometres in a day.

Behind the ponies came Meares with one sledge and some dogs. Meares knew how to drive dogs. Every day, Meares started two hours after the ponies, and arrived two hours before them.

After five days, they found the motor sledges.

*　*　*　*　*

The Norwegians began again on October 20th. There were five men this time—Amundsen, Bjaaland, Wisting, Hassel, and Hanssen. They had four sledges, and forty-eight dogs.

There was a lot of wind and fog. On the first day, Wisting's sledge suddenly stopped, and the back went down. 'Come on, you dogs!' he said angrily. 'Pull! Pull!' At first nothing happened; then, slowly, the sledge moved again. Wisting looked down, over the side of the sledge. Under the snow, there was a fifty-metre hole.

'Did you see that?' Amundsen said. 'The ice wants to eat us—men, dogs, sledges, everything.'

On the fourth day they reached the depot at 80° South. There was a bad snowstorm, but they found the flags easily. Next day the men stayed in their tents, and the dogs played in their holes under the snow. They were all happy. They had a lot of food, they had good equipment, and they were warm. They could travel fast.

Next morning, the snowstorm stopped, and the journey began again. Today, everything is wonderful, Bjaaland wrote in his diary. But where is Scott? In front of us, or behind?

*　*　*　*　*

There was no one with the motor sledges; they were broken. Scott looked at them angrily.

'It doesn't matter,' he said. 'Teddy Evans and his men are in front of us. They're good men—they're pulling their sledges themselves. We can get to the Pole on foot.'

Oates looked at Meares. Oates and the ponies were tired, but Meares and his dogs were not. The snow was home for them.

That night, Oates wrote: Three motor sledges at ￡1,000 each, 19 ponies at ￡5 each, 32 dogs at ￡1.50 each. Well, it's not my money, it's Scott's.

On November 21st, one of the ponies died.

*　*　*　*　*

On November 11th, the Norwegians saw the mountains.

The mountains were very high—some of the highest on earth. Bjaaland smiled.

'There is good skiing up there, Roald,' he said. 'But can dogs get up there too?'

'Of course they can,' Amundsen said. 'Come on.'

They left Hanssen with the dogs, and skied a little way up the mountains. It was difficult, but the mountains were big and beautiful. Behind the mountains, Amundsen thought there was a high plateau of ice. 'That's it,' Amundsen said. 'That's the road to the Pole. Tomorrow, we can bring the dogs and sledges up here. But now, let's have a ski race. Who can get back to camp first?'

They laughed, and skied happily down the white snow. 'This is like home,' Bjaaland thought. 'But it's bigger than Norway, and better.'

In the next four days, the dogs pulled the sledges eighty-one kilometres, and went up 3,000 metres. At last, Amundsen and Bjaaland stood on the plateau behind the mountains. They were tired, happy men.

Bjaaland looked back at the mountains. 'Can a motor sledge get up here?' he asked.

Amundsen smiled. 'No,' he said. 'I don't think so. And Scott doesn't like dogs. So his men are going to pull their sledges up these mountains themselves. Would you like to do that, Olav?'

Bjaaland didn't answer. He smiled, and skied happily away across the snow.

7 　机动雪橇与大山

斯科特现有两辆机动雪橇，这两辆机动雪橇不仅在南极洲而且在地球上也是首次出现。10月24日，机动雪橇向南进发，离开了开普埃文斯。4人随雪橇同往，但斯科特在开普埃文斯多逗留了一星期。

奥茨心中不快。他给母亲写信说：我们在这儿度过了一个极为恶劣的冬天。我不喜欢斯科特。我们整个冬天都在这儿闲着，可是他既不学滑雪，也不学驾驭狗。我们的设备不好，但他是不会为别人着想的。一旦我们踏上旅程，我将与他同睡一个帐篷，但我不愿意。

11月1日，斯科特、奥茨以及其他6个人离开了开普埃文斯，他们带着8辆雪橇、8匹小马。这些小马走得不快，因为马腿总会踩进雪里。这对它们来说太辛苦了。它们的体力消耗得很快，一天只能走十三四公里。

在小马后面，是米尔斯，他驾着一辆狗拉的雪橇。米尔斯懂得驾驭狗。每天，小马出发后两小时，米尔斯才上路，却比它们还先到两小时。

5天以后，他们追上了机动雪橇。

*　*　*　*　*

10月20日，挪威人又出发了。这次共5人：阿蒙森、比阿兰德、威斯丁、哈塞尔和汉森。他们带着4辆雪橇和48条狗。

狂风呼啸，浓雾茫茫。第一天，威斯丁的雪橇忽然停住了，雪橇后部陷了下去。“使劲，你们这些小狗！”他狂怒地说，“拉呀！拉呀！”刚开始时，雪橇一动不动。后来，雪橇缓慢地移动起来。威斯丁从雪橇边探头往下一看。在雪地之下，有个50米深的大洞。

“你刚才看见这洞吗？”阿蒙森说，“冰窟窿打算将我们全都吃掉：人、狗还有雪橇，所有的一切。”

第4天，他们到达南纬80°的贮藏屋。虽然有恶劣的暴风雪，但是他们还是顺利地找到旗帜。次日，他们待在帐篷里，小狗也在雪洞里嬉闹。他们的情绪很高，食物充足，设备精良，人也暖洋洋的。他们可以快速前进。

次日早晨，暴风雪停了，他们又上路了。今天，一切美好极了！ 比阿兰德在日记里写道。可是斯科特在那儿呢？在我们前面，还是在我们后面？

*　*　*　*　*

这时，没有任何人驾驶机动雪橇了：全坏了。斯科特生气地看着这些雪橇。

“没什么关系，”他说，“特迪·埃文斯和他的人在我们前面。他们都很优秀：他们自己正拉着雪橇前进。我们可以凭双脚走到南极。”

奥茨看着米尔斯。奥茨与他的小马人困马乏，而米尔斯与他的小狗则不同，茫茫雪原对于他和他的小狗来说，就像家一样。

那晚，奥茨写道：3辆机动雪橇，每辆价值1000英镑；19匹小马，每匹5英镑；32条狗，每条1.5英镑。当然不是我花钱，而是斯科特掏的腰包。

11月21日，一匹小马死了。

*　*　*　*　*

11月11日，挪威人见到了群山。

群山高耸而立，它们属于地球上的一些最高的山了。比阿兰德露出了笑容。

“在上面可以很好地滑雪，罗阿尔，”他说，“但是狗群也能上得去吗？”

“当然，它们能上去。”阿蒙森说着，“走吧！”

他们将狗留给汉森，朝山上滑行了一小段。这可不容易，但群山巍峨秀丽，可以尽情领略。阿蒙森认为群山之后还有一片冰封高原。“就是那儿啦，”阿蒙森说，“那就是通往南极之路。明天，我们可以将狗与雪橇带到这儿来。现在，咱们来一场滑雪比赛，看谁最先回到营地。”

众人大笑，愉快地在白雪之上飞滑而下。“这仿佛是在家中，”比阿兰德心想，“然而这儿比挪威更加辽阔、美好。”

在后来的4天时间内，群狗拉着雪橇跑了81公里，爬了3000米的坡。最终，阿蒙森与比阿兰德将大山抛在身后，站在了高原上，他们虽然很累，但心花怒放。

比阿兰德回头看了看群山。“机动雪橇能上得来吗？”他问。

阿蒙森笑了。“不，”他说，“我认为不行。因为斯科特不喜欢狗，所以他的人得靠自己把雪橇拖上山了。你喜欢这样做吗，奥拉夫？”

比阿兰德没有回答，脸上露出了微笑。他愉快地开始了横越雪地滑行。

Chapter 8

Across the Plateau

On November 21st, the Norwegians killed thirty dogs. 'They were happy,' Amundsen said. 'And now they're going to die quickly. We need three sledges, and eighteen dogs, to go to the Pole.'

When the dogs were dead, the other dogs ate them. The men ate them, too. They were good friends, Bjaaland wrote in his diary. And now they are good food. Two days later, the dogs were fat. Then, in a snowstorm, they began the journey again.

After the snowstorm, there was fog, and in the fog, they got lost on an ice river with hundreds of big holes in it. They could see nothing, and it was very dangerous. In four days they moved nine kilometres. But the ice is beautiful, Bjaaland wrote. Blue and green and white. This is a wonderful place—but I don't want to stay a long time.

After the ice, there were strong winds and bad snowstorms. They could see nothing in front of them. But every day, they travelled twenty-five or thirty kilometres. Then, on December 9th, the sun came out. They were at 88°23′South—175 kilometres from the Pole.

Five more long days, Bjaaland wrote. That's all now. But where is Scott?

*　*　*　*　*

For four days, Scott's men stayed in their tents near the mountains. There is a bad snowstorm outside, Oates wrote. It's too cold for the ponies, and our clothes and skis are bad, too.

On December 9th, Oates killed the ponies. They were tired and ill and they could not walk up to the plateau. Then Meares and his dogs went back to Cape Evans. 'We can pull the sledges ourselves,' Scott said. 'We can do it—we're all strong men.'

There were two sledges and eight men. They went twenty-four kilometres a day. On December 31st, Scott said to Teddy Evans, and the men on the second sledge: 'You can't ski well. Leave your skis here.' So they pulled their sledge twenty-four kilometres without skis.

Next day, Scott went to Teddy Evans's tent. 'You are ill, Teddy,' he said. 'You can't come to the Pole. Take two men and go back, tomorrow.'

Teddy Evans was very unhappy. 'Two men, Captain?' he said. 'Why not three?'

'Because Bowers is going to come with me,' Scott said. 'He's strong—we need him.'

'But... you have food on your sledge for four men, not five!' Evans said. 'And Bowers has no skis!'

'I'm the Captain, Teddy!' Scott said. 'You do what I say. Take two men and leave Bowers with me!'

Oates wrote to his mother: I am going to the Pole with Scott. I am pleased and I feel strong. But in his diary he wrote: My feet are very bad. They are always wet now, and they don't look good.

On January 4th Scott's men left Teddy Evans and went on. Scott, Oates, Wilson and Edgar Evans had skis, but Bowers did not. They were 270 kilometres from the Pole.

*　*　*　*　*

December 14th 1911 was a warm, sunny day. Five Norwegians skied over the beautiful white snow. It was very quiet. No one spoke. They were excited, and happy.

'Six more kilometres,' Bjaaland thought. Is there a British flag? I can't see a flag, but...

'Look!' Hassel said. 'What's that over there?'

Bjaaland left his sledge and skied quickly away over the snow. 'What is it?' he thought. 'Is it...? No!'

'It's nothing!' he called. 'There's nothing there... nothing!'

Three kilometres, two. 'Roald!' Hanssen called to Amundsen. 'Go in front of me, please. It helps my dogs.'

'That's not true,' Bjaaland thought. 'His dogs are running well today. But Hanssen wants Amundsen to be first. The first man at the South Pole!'

They skied on and on, over the beautiful snow.

'Stop!' Amundsen said. He waited quietly for his men. 'This is it,' he said.

Bjaaland looked at him. 'But there's nothing here,' he said.

Amundsen smiled. 'Oh yes there is,' he said. 'There's something very important here, Olav. Very, very important.'

'What's that, Roald?'

'Us. We're here now. Isn't that important, Olav?'

The four men stood on the snow, and looked at him. Then, slowly, they all began to laugh.

8 　穿越高原

11月21日，挪威人杀了30条狗。

“这些狗过得很愉快，”阿蒙森说，“但是现在，它们很快就要死了。我们去南极只需要3辆雪橇、18条狗。”

这些狗处死后，活着的狗吃它们的肉，大家也都吃。它们是我们的好朋友， 比阿兰德在日记里这样写道，现在又成为好食物。 两天之后，群狗都养胖了。随后，他们冒着暴风雪再度踏上旅程。

暴风雪过后，浓雾弥漫。在隐藏着无数大冰洞的冰河上，他们完全被裹在茫茫浓雾之中，什么也看不见。这太危险了。4天内，他们仅前行了9公里。但是这些冰层非常美丽， 比阿兰德这样写道，蓝、绿、白三色。这是个迷人的地方，然而我不愿久留。

走过冰河之后，又遇到凛冽的寒风和可怕的暴风雪。他们眼前茫茫一片，什么也看不见。但是每天，他们仍旧要走25至30公里。12月9日那天，太阳出来了。他们到达了南纬88°23′的地区，距南极175公里。

再过5个漫长的日子， 比阿兰德这样写，一切便完成了。可是斯科特在哪儿呢？

*　*　*　*　*

4天来，斯科特的人一直留在大山附近的帐篷内。外面下着可怕的暴风雪 ，奥茨这样写道，这太冷啦，令小马不堪忍受。我们的衣服与滑雪板也都坏了。

12月9日，奥茨杀了几匹小马。这些马又累又病，不可能登上高原了。于是，米尔斯与他的狗群返回了开普埃文斯。“我们可以自己拖雪橇，”斯科特说，“我们能够做到：我们个个都是身强力壮。”

两辆雪橇与8个人，每天走24公里。12月31日，斯科特对特迪·埃文斯以及那些拖着第二辆雪橇的人说：“既然你们不太会滑雪，不如将滑雪板丢在这儿。”于是，他们不用滑雪板而是拉雪橇走了24公里。

第二天，斯科特来到特迪·埃文斯的帐篷内。“你病了，特迪，”他说，“你去不了南极了。明天带着两个人回去吧。”

特迪·埃文斯非常不满。“两个人，队长？”他说，“为什么不是3个人呢？”

“因为鲍尔斯将同我一道前进，”斯科特说，“他身体很棒，我们需要他。”

“但是……你们雪橇上装的食物是供4人食用的，而不是5人！”埃文斯说，“再说鲍尔斯的滑雪板也扔了！”

“我是队长，特迪！”斯科特说，“你照我的话去做。带两个人走，将鲍尔斯留给我！”

奥茨给他的母亲写信说：我正跟随着斯科特向南极进发。我感到欣喜，而且感到精力旺盛。 但是他在日记里却是这样写的：我的脚已经非常糟糕了，现在总是湿漉漉的，看来状况不妙。

1月4日，斯科特一行离开了特迪，继续上路了。斯科特、奥茨、威尔逊、埃德加·埃文斯都有滑雪板，然而鲍尔斯没有。他们距南极还有270公里。

*　*　*　*　*

1911年12月14日，天气暖和，阳光明媚。5个挪威人在美丽的白雪上滑行着，四周非常安静，没人讲话。他们感到兴奋、欣喜。

“再走6公里，”比阿兰德心想。英国国旗到达那儿了吗？我一面旗帜也没见到，但是……

“瞧！”哈塞尔说，“那儿是什么？”

比阿兰德丢下他的雪橇，在雪地上飞快滑行赶去看。“这是什么？”他心想，“难道是……？不！”

“没东西！”他高声叫着说，“什么东西也没有……啥也没有！”

还有3公里，还有2公里。“罗阿尔！”汉森高声呼唤着阿蒙森，“请你走在我前头，这对我的狗群有好处。”

“不是这回事儿，”比阿兰德心想，“他的狗今天表现不错。汉森是想让阿蒙森成为第一人，第一个到达南极的人！”

他们继续向前滑行，在这美丽的雪原上滑行。

“停下！”阿蒙森说。他静静地等着他的属员。“就是这儿。”他说。

比阿兰德看着他。“可是这儿没有任何东西。”他说。

阿蒙森笑了笑。“啊，不对，有东西，”他说，“这儿有样非常重要的东西，奥拉夫。非常非常重要。”

“什么东西，罗阿尔？”

“我们这些人！我们现在站在这儿，难道还不重要，奥拉夫？”

4个人站在雪地里，看着他。渐渐地，大家开始大笑起来。

Chapter 9

The End of the Race

The Norwegians stayed two days at the Pole. They left a tent there, with a Norwegian flag on it. Inside the tent, they left some food, a letter for the King of Norway, and a letter for Scott.

They left some more black flags near the Pole, and one twenty-eight kilometres north. Then they skied away, back to the north.

It's a beautiful day , Bjaaland wrote. The sun is warm, the snow is good. But the dogs run too quickly—I can't get in front of them!

They found their depots easily. There were ten between the Pole and Framheim. Each depot had a lot of food. They laughed and skied quickly down the mountains. Often, they skied fifty kilometres a day. On Friday, January 26th, 1912, they came back to Framheim. It was four o'clock in the morning.

Inside the wooden house, Lindstrøm, the cook, was asleep. Amundsen walked quietly to his bed. 'Good morning, Lindstrøm,' he said. 'Is our coffee ready?'

*　*　*　*　*

The black flags waited at the Pole.

'What's that, Captain?' Bowers said. 'Over there?'

'Where?' Scott asked. 'What—oh my God!'

They all saw the small black flag in the snow, two kilometres in front of them. Slowly, they pulled their sledge to it.

Next day, January 17th 1912, they found the tent and the Norwegian flag. Near it, Scott took the British flag from under his clothes, and put it up. In his diary, Scott wrote: This is a very bad day. We are all tired, and have cold feet and hands. It is -30° Centigrade and there is a snowstorm. Great God! This is an awful place!

They turned north. Five tired, unhappy men, in the coldest, emptiest place on earth.

On March 13th, 1912, Scott's wife Kathleen, looked at her morning newspaper. NORWAY'S FLAG AT SOUTH POLE, it said. She looked at it for a long time, and then began to cry.

'What's the matter?' her friend asked.

'My poor, poor husband,' Mrs Scott said. 'What's happened to him? Where is he now?'

*　*　*　*　*

Scott's men were always hungry. There were not many depots and they were difficult to find. We need to find the next depot today, Oates wrote. But how can we find one black flag in all this snow? It's very difficult. And there is food for four men, not five.

They were all tired and ill, too. Oates's feet were black now, and he could not feel them. On February 16th, Edgar Evans died.

On the 17th they were past the mountains. At the depot there they ate one of the dead ponies. Then they went on—ten, eleven, twelve kilometres a day. They were ill because their clothes were not warm and they didn't have much food. The temperature was sometimes -40° Centigrade.

On March 7th Scott looked at Oates's feet. They were big and black. 'I can't pull the sledge now,' Oates said. 'It's very difficult to walk. Am I going to lose these feet, Captain?'

Scott looked at Oates's feet, and said nothing.

On March 9th they found another depot, but there was not much food. Slowly, they walked on. Oates's feet were worse every day.

March 17th was Oates's birthday. He was thirty-two. He lay in the tent and listened to the wind outside. He was very cold, very hungry, and very very tired.

He wrote a letter to his mother and gave it to Wilson. Then he got up, and opened the door of the tent. He stopped in the door for a minute. Scott, Wilson, and Bowers looked at him. They didn't speak.

'I'm going outside for a minute,' Oates said. 'I may be some time.'

They didn't see him again.

*　*　*　*　*

At Cape Evans, the Englishmen waited. On December 11th, Meares and the dogs came back. On January 3rd, Teddy Evans and his two men arrived at Cape Evans. The Terra Nova came, and went. Winter began. Scott did not come.

The Englishmen waited all winter at Cape Evans. Then, on October 26th 1912, they started for the south. Two weeks later, they found a tent.

There were three bodies in the tent—Scott, Wilson, and Bowers. They put the bodies under the snow. Then they took the men's letters and diaries, and went north to Cape Evans again.

In Scott's diary they read: Oates died like a good Englishman. We all did. Please, remember us, and look after our families. We did our best.

No one found Oates's body. But he is there, somewhere, under the snow and the wind, in the coldest, emptiest place on earth.

挪威人在南极逗留了两天。他们在那儿留下一顶帐篷，帐篷顶上插着一面挪威国旗。帐篷里，他们留下一些食物，一封致挪威国王的信，还有一封致斯科特的信。

他们在南极附近留下更多的黑旗，在南极以北28公里处插一面旗。随后，他们滑行而去，返回北方。

这天太美好了， 比阿兰德这样写，太阳暖融融的，雪原也变得可爱。然而群狗跑得极快，我无法赶在它们前面！

他们顺利地找到了自己的贮藏屋。从南极到弗雷门海姆，共有10座贮藏屋。每座贮藏屋都贮藏有许多食物。他们欢声笑语，飞快地向山下滑行而去。他们经常一天滑行50公里。1912年1月26日，星期五，他们返回到弗雷门海姆。当时为凌晨4点。

木屋内，厨师林德斯特伦正酣睡着。阿蒙森无声地走到他床前。“早上好，林德斯特伦，”他说，“我们的咖啡准备好了吗？”

*　*　*　*　*

那些黑色的旗帜在南极等候着。

“那是什么，队长？”鲍尔斯问，“就在那儿。”

“哪儿？”斯科特问，“什么？啊，我的上帝！”

所有人都看见了插在雪地上的小黑旗，位于他们前面两公里处。他们缓慢地拖着雪橇朝那面旗帜走去。

第二天，1912年1月17日，他们发现了那顶帐篷与挪威国旗。来到帐篷附近，斯科特从衣服内拿出英国国旗，将它挂起来。在他的日记里，斯科特这样写道：这天简直糟糕透了。我们大家都疲惫不堪，手脚冰凉。气温为-30℃。这时又刮起暴风雪。天啊，这地方太可怕了！

在地球上最寒冷、最空旷的地方，站着5位心力交瘁、情绪低落的人。他们回头向北。

*　*　*　*　*

1912年3月13日，斯科特的妻子凯思林正阅读着晨报。报纸上登着：挪威国旗插上南极 。她长时间注视着这条消息，然后哭起来。

挪威国旗插上南极

“出什么事啦？”她的朋友问。

“我好可怜的丈夫，”斯科特夫人说，“他出什么事儿啦？他现在在哪儿？”

*　*　*　*　*

斯科特的人一直是饥肠辘辘。他们没设多少贮藏屋，而且找起来也很费事。今天，我们必须找到下一个贮藏屋， 奥茨这样写，可是在这茫茫雪原之中，我们怎样找到一面黑旗？这太难了，现在的食物只够4个人食用，而不是5个人。

他们一行人病累交加。奥茨的双脚已经发黑，失去了感觉。2月16日，埃德加·埃文斯辞世而去。

17日，他们翻过了大山。在那儿的贮藏屋，他们吃了一匹死马。随后他们继续上路，每天走10公里、11公里、12公里。他们全生病了，因为他们的衣服已经不能保暖，食物也不多。当时的气温有时是-40℃。

3月7日，斯科特看着奥茨的双脚，又肿又黑。“现在，我拉不动雪橇了，”奥茨说，“就连走路都非常吃力。我这双脚还能保得住吗，队长？”

斯科特看着奥茨的双脚，什么也说不出来。

3月9日，他们找到另一个贮藏屋，但是食物并没有多少。他们缓慢地继续走着。奥茨的双脚日渐恶化。

3月17日是奥茨的生日，他年满32岁。他躺在帐篷里，听着外面的寒风。极度的饥寒交迫使他感到非常非常疲倦。

他给母亲写了封信，交给了威尔逊。随后，他起身，打开帐篷门，在门前犹豫了一会儿。斯科特、威尔逊、鲍尔斯都看着他，谁也没讲话。

“我出去一会儿，”奥茨说，“或许过一阵子我才能回来。”

他们再也没见到他。

*　*　*　*　*

在开普埃文斯，好些英国人在翘首期待着。12月11日这一天，米尔斯与狗群回来了。1月3日这一天，特迪·埃文斯与另外两个人也回到开普埃文斯。特若·诺瓦号船驶来后，又离去了。又是一个寒冬来临，斯科特一直没回来。

英国人在开普埃文斯等待了整整一个冬天。随后，在1912年10月26日，他们向南出发了。两周后，他们发现一顶帐篷。

帐篷内有3具尸体：斯科特、威尔逊、鲍尔斯。他们将这些遗体葬在雪地里，随后，带着这些人的书信与日记，往北返回开普埃文斯。

在斯科特的日记里，他们读到：奥茨死得像个英国汉子。我们大家也不逊色。请记住我们，请照看我们的家人。我们已经尽了全力。

没人找到奥茨的遗体。但是他就在那儿，在地球上最寒冷、最空旷的地方，在风雪中的某个地方。

ALADDINAND THE ENCHANTED LAMP

AND THE ENCHANTED LAMP

Aladdin is a lazy boy. He does not like work and he plays all day with his friends in the market. He and his mother are very poor, and are often hungry, but Aladdin never works, and never helps his mother.

One day Aladdin's uncle, Abanazar, arrives in the city. 'I am a rich man,' he tells Aladdin and his mother. He gives them gold, buys Aladdin a beautiful new coat, and wants to help them. Aladdin is very happy.

But Abanazar is not Aladdin's uncle. He is a magician from Morocco, and he wants to find an enchanted lamp. He knows the lamp is in a magical garden under the ground, near a city in Arabia. Only a poor boy from the city can get into the garden and find the lamp. And that boy's name is Aladdin...

1Help from a rich man

Help from a rich man

Many years ago, in a city in Arabia, there was a boy called Aladdin. He lived with his mother in a little house near the market, and they were very poor. Aladdin's mother worked all day, and sometimes half the night, but Aladdin never helped her.

He was a lazy boy and he did not like to work. He only wanted to play all the time. Every morning he ran through the streets to the market. There, he talked and laughed and played with his friends all day. Then in the evening he went home for his dinner.

And every night his mother said to him: 'Oh, Aladdin, Aladdin! You are a lazy boy — a good-for-nothing! When are you going to do some work, my son?'

But Aladdin never listened to his mother.

One day in the market there was an old man in a long black coat. Aladdin did not see him, but the old man watched Aladdin very carefully. After some minutes he went up to an orange-seller and asked:

'That boy in the green coat — who is he?'

'Aladdin, son of Mustafa,' was the answer.

The old man moved away. 'Yes,' he said quietly. 'Yes, that is the boy. The right name, and the right father.'

Then he called out to Aladdin: 'Boy! Come here for a minute. Is your name Aladdin? Aladdin, son of Mustafa?'

Aladdin left his friends and came to the old man. 'Yes,' he said, 'I am Aladdin, son of Mustafa. But my father is dead. He died five years ago.'

'Dead!'said the old man.'Oh, no!'He put his face in his hands and began to cry.

'Why are you crying?' asked Aladdin. 'Did you know my father?'

The old man looked up. 'Mustafa was my brother!' he said. 'I wanted to see him again, and now you tell me he is dead. Oh, this is not a happy day for me!' Then he put his hand on Aladdin's arm. 'But here is my brother's son, and I can see Mustafa in your face, my boy. Aladdin, I am your uncle, Abanazar.'

'My uncle?' said Aladdin. He was very surprised. 'Did my father have a brother? I didn't know that.'

'I went away before you were born, my boy,' said the old man. 'Look.' He took ten pieces of gold out of his bag, and put them into Aladdin's hands. 'Go home to your mother and give this money to her. Tell her about me, and say this:"Her husband's brother wants to meet her, and he is going to visit her tomorrow."'

Ten pieces of gold is a lot of money and Aladdin was very happy. He ran home quickly and gave the gold to his mother. At first she was afraid.

'Where did you get this, Aladdin? Did you find it? It isn't our money. You must give it back.'

'But it is our money, Mother,' said Aladdin. 'My uncle, my father's brother, gave the money to us. Uncle Abanazar is coming to visit us tomorrow.'

'Who? You don't have an uncle Abanazar.'

'But he knows my name, and my father's name,' Aladdin said. 'And he gave ten pieces of gold to me. He's very nice. You must make a good dinner for him.'

The next day Abanazar arrived at Aladdin's house.

'My sister!' he said and smiled. 'My dead brother's wife! I am happy to find you and Aladdin.'

'Sit down, Abanazar. We're happy to see you in our poor home,' Aladdin's mother said. She put meat, rice and fruit on the table. 'But I don't understand. Why did my husband never speak about you?'

'I'm sorry, my sister. When we were young, my brother and I were not friends for many years. Then I went away to a far country. I am an old man now and wanted to see my brother again and take his hand. But he is dead, and I cannot speak to him or say goodbye to him now!'

Abanazar had tears in his eyes and Aladdin's mother began to cry too.

'But I am home again now,' the old man said, 'and I can help my brother's wife and his son, because I am a rich man.' He looked at Aladdin. 'Aladdin, my boy, what work do you do?'

Aladdin did not answer and his face was red.

'Oh, don't ask Aladdin questions about work!' his mother said. 'He never works. He plays with his friends all day, and only comes home when he is hungry.'

'Well, my boy, tomorrow we must get a new coat for you. Then we can talk about work. Would you like to have a shop in the market perhaps?'

Aladdin smiled. 'A shop,' he thought, 'and me, a rich market-seller. Why not?'

1． 一个富人的帮助

很多年以前，在一个阿拉伯城市里，有一个男孩儿叫阿拉丁。他和他的母亲住在市场附近一个很小的屋子里，过着穷苦的日子。阿拉丁的母亲整天都在辛勤地劳作，有时甚至忙碌到深夜，但阿拉丁从来都不帮助她。

他很懒惰，不喜欢劳动，只想整天玩耍。每天早晨他都穿过街道跑到市场上，一整天都和伙伴们在那儿说笑嬉戏，傍晚时分才回家吃饭。

每天晚上他的母亲都对他说：“唉，阿拉丁，阿拉丁！你这个懒惰的孩子——真是没用！你什么时候才能做点儿事呢，儿子？”

但阿拉丁从来都不听母亲的话。

一天，市场上来了一个身穿黑色长袍的老头儿。阿拉丁并没有注意到他，老头儿却在仔细地观察着阿拉丁。过了好一会儿他走到一个卖橘子的摊贩前问道：

“那个穿绿衣服的男孩子——他是谁啊？”

“阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子。”摊贩答道。

老头儿随即走开了。“是的，”他低声地自言自语道，“是的，就是这个男孩儿。就是这个名字，他父亲的名字也对。”

然后他冲阿拉丁喊道：“孩子！过来—下。你是叫阿拉丁吗？阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子？”

阿拉丁离开他的伙伴们来到老头儿面前。“是的，”他说，“我是阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子。但我父亲已经死了，他五年前就死了。”

“死了！”老头儿说，“哦，不！”他用手蒙着脸哭了起来。

“你为什么哭？”阿拉丁问道，“你认识我父亲吗？”

老头儿抬起头来。“穆斯塔法是我的兄弟！”他说，“我很想见到他，却得知他已经死了。哦，对我来说这是多么悲惨的一天啊！”他把手搭在阿拉丁的臂上，“但我兄弟的儿子在这里，我可以从你的脸上看到穆斯塔法的影子，我的孩子。阿拉丁，我是你的叔叔阿巴那扎尔啊。”

“我的叔叔？”阿拉丁很惊讶，“我父亲有个兄弟吗？可我并不知道。”

“在你出生之前我就离开了，我的孩子，”老头儿说道，“拿着。”他从钱袋里拿出10枚金币交到阿拉丁的手中，“回家把这些钱给你母亲，告诉她她丈夫的兄弟想来看她，他明天就会来。”

10枚金币是很大一笔钱，阿拉丁很高兴。他飞快地跑回家中把金币交给母亲。起初她很害怕。

“阿拉丁，你是从哪儿弄来这些钱的？是捡来的吗？这不是我们的钱，你必须还回去。”

“但这确实是 我们的钱啊，妈妈，”阿拉丁说，“这是我叔叔、我父亲的兄弟给咱们的钱。阿巴那扎尔叔叔明天会来看咱们。”

“谁？你没有一个叫阿巴那扎尔的叔叔啊。”

“但他知道我的名字，也知道我父亲的名字，”阿拉丁说，“他给了我10枚金币。他是一个非常好的人。你要好好地给他做顿饭。”

第二天阿巴那扎尔来到阿拉丁的家中。

“我的嫂子！”他微笑道，“我死去的兄弟的妻子！我很高兴能找到你和阿拉丁。”

“快请坐，阿巴那扎尔。很高兴在我们的寒舍见到你，”阿拉丁的母亲说。她把肉、米饭和水果摆上桌。“但我还是不明白，我丈夫怎么从来都没有提起过你呢？”

“我很惭愧，嫂子。我们都还年轻的时候，我和我兄弟的关系有很多年都不是很好。后来我就离家去了一个遥远的国度。现在我老了，想再见到我的兄弟，跟他和好。但他已辞世，我不能和他说话，也不能和他说再见了！”

阿巴那扎尔眼含热泪，阿拉丁的母亲也哭了起来。

“但我现在回家了，”老头儿说，“我可以帮助我兄弟的妻子和儿子，因为我很有钱。”他转过头看着阿拉丁，“阿拉丁，我的孩子，你现在做什么工作呢？”

阿拉丁没有回答，脸涨得通红。

“哦，不要问阿拉丁工作的事！”他母亲说，“他从来都不工作，整天在外面跟他那些朋友们玩耍，只有饿了的时候才回家。”

“好了，我的孩子，明天我得给你买件新外套，然后我们再谈谈工作。也许你想在市场上拥有一家店铺？”

阿拉丁笑了。“一家店铺，”他暗自想道，“我会成为一个富有的店主。为什么不呢？”

2A walk to nowhere

A walk to nowhere

Early the next morning, Abanazar arrived at Aladdin's house and then he and Aladdin walked to the market.

'First of all we must look at coats,' Abanazar said.

Soon Aladdin had an expensive new coat and he felt very happy. Then Abanazar and Aladdin walked through the market and looked at the shops. They drank coffee, talked to people, and had a very good dinner. It was a wonderful day for Aladdin.

On Friday, when the market was closed, Abanazar took Aladdin to the beautiful gardens in the city. They walked under the trees and talked about a shop for Aladdin.

'You are very good to me, Uncle,' Aladdin said.

Abanazar smiled. 'But of course,' he said. 'You are my brother's son. Now, let us leave the city and go up into the hills. There is something wonderful there, and you must see it.'

They left the gardens, walked past the Sultan's palace, and out of the city up into the hills. They walked for a long time and Aladdin began to feel tired.

'It's not far now,' said Abanazar. 'We're going to see a beautiful garden—more beautiful than the garden of the Sultan's palace.'

At last Abanazar stopped. 'Here we are,' he said.

Aladdin looked, but he could see no gardens on the hills. 'Where is this garden, Uncle?' he said.

'First we must make a fire,' said Abanazar.

Aladdin did not understand, but he made a fire for his uncle on the ground. Then Abanazar took some powder out of a small box, and put it on the fire. He closed his eyes and said, 'Abracadabra !'

At once, the sky went dark. Black smoke came from the fire, and the ground under the fire began to open. Then the smoke went away, and in the ground there was now a big white stone with a ring in it.

Aladdin was very afraid. He began to run away, but Abanazar took his arm and hit him on the head.

For a minute or two Aladdin could not speak or move. Then he cried, 'Why did you do that, Uncle?'

'You must be a man now, not a child,' said Abanazar. 'I am your father's brother, and you must obey me. Don't be afraid. In a short time you're going to be a rich man. Now, listen carefully.' He took Aladdin's hand. 'Only you can move this stone. Put your hand on the ring and say your name and your father's name.'

Very afraid, Aladdin put his hand on the ring. It was not hot, but very cold. 'I am Aladdin, son of Mustafa,' he said. The stone moved easily, and now Aladdin could see stairs under the ground.

'Go down those stairs,' Abanazar said, 'and then through four big rooms. In the last room there is a door into a garden, and under one of the trees there is a lamp. You can take some fruit from the trees, but first you must find the lamp. Bring the lamp to me.'

'Please come with me, Uncle!' Aladdin said.

'No. Only you can do this, my boy.' Abanazar took a gold ring off his finger and gave it to Aladdin. 'This ring is magic and can protect you,' he said. 'Be careful, and bring me the lamp quickly!'

Aladdin put the ring on the little finger of his left hand and began to go down the stairs. It was dark and he was afraid, but he was more afraid of Abanazar.

And Aladdin was right to be afraid, because Abanazar was not his uncle. He was a magician from Morocco, and he wanted this lamp very much. It was a magic lamp, and only a poor boy from the city could get it for him—a boy called Aladdin.

Aladdin went down a hundred stairs and into the first room. Down here, it was not dark and he went quickly through the rooms to the door into the garden. There were trees in the garden, with beautiful fruit of different colours—white, red, green, and yellow.

He soon found the lamp, under one of the trees. 'Why does my uncle want this dirty old lamp?' he thought. He put it in his pocket. Then he began to take fruit from the trees, and to put it in every pocket of his coat. After that he went back to the stairs and began to go up. Soon he could see Abanazar and the blue sky.

'Give the lamp to me,' Abanazar said, and put out his hand. 'Quickly, boy, the lamp!'

Aladdin could not get the lamp out of his pocket because it was under the fruit. He looked at Abanazar's angry face and was afraid.

'First help me out, then you can have the lamp,' he said. 'Please, Uncle!'

'First the lamp,' cried Abanazar. 'Give me the lamp!'

'No!' Aladdin said.

'You good-for-nothing! You dog! You and the lamp can stay down there!' Angrily, Abanazar ran to the fire and put more powder on it. 'Abracadabra !' he called.

The big white stone moved again, and now Aladdin could not see the sky. He was in the dark, under the ground, and could not get out.

2． 不知走向何处

第二天一早，阿巴那扎尔就来到阿拉丁的家里，带着阿拉丁去了市场。

“首先我们必须帮你挑选衣服。”阿巴那扎尔说。

很快阿拉丁就有了一件崭新的、价格不菲的外套，他非常高兴。然后他们就开始逛市场，看了很多家商店。他们喝了咖啡，和人们聊天，还吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐。对阿拉丁来说这真是美好的一天。

星期五市场关门以后，阿巴那扎尔就带着阿拉丁去了城里那座美丽的公园。他们在树下散步，讨论着为阿拉丁开店铺的事。

“你对我真是太好了，叔叔。”阿拉丁说道。

阿巴那扎尔露出了微笑。“那当然，”他说，“你是我兄弟的儿子。现在我们去城外的山里吧，那儿有一些美妙的东西，你必须去看看。”

他们离开公园，经过苏丹的宫殿，来到城外的山里。他们走了很长时间，阿拉丁感觉有些累了。

“不太远了，”阿巴那扎尔说，“我们会看到一个美丽的花园——比苏丹王宫里的花园还要漂亮。”

阿巴那扎尔终于停了下来。“我们到了。”他说。

阿拉丁四下里看了看，但山里没有任何花园的影子。“花园在哪儿呢，叔叔？”他问道。

“我们必须先点一堆火。”阿巴那扎尔说。

阿拉丁不明白这是什么意思，但还是为叔叔在地上生了一堆火。然后阿巴那扎尔从一个小盒子里拿出一些药粉撒在火里，闭上眼睛念念有词道：“阿不拉卡达不拉 ！”

天空立刻暗了下来。火堆里冒出黑烟，火底下的地面裂开了。黑烟散尽后，地面上出现了一块白色的巨石，上面还有一个环。

阿拉丁非常害怕。他拔腿就跑，但阿巴那扎尔一把抓住他的手臂，抡起一掌打在他的头上。

有那么一两分钟，阿拉丁说不出话来，也动弹不得。然后他哭了起来：“你为什么要那样做呢，叔叔？”

“你现在必须是一个男人了，而不是一个孩子。”阿巴那扎尔说，“我是你父亲的兄弟，你必须听我的。不要害怕，你很快就会成为一个富翁。现在，好好听着。”他拉起阿拉丁的手，“只有你能够移开这块石头。用手抓住这个环，同时喊出你和你父亲的名字。”

阿拉丁战战兢兢地抓住那个环。环一点也不热，倒是非常冰冷。“我是阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子。”他说道。巨石很轻易地被移开了，阿拉丁看到地下有一道台阶。

“沿着那些台阶走下去，”阿巴那扎尔说，“穿过四个大屋子。在最后一个房间里有一扇门通向一个花园，园里的一棵树下有一盏油灯。你可以从那些树上摘一些果子，但你必须先找到那盏油灯，并把它带给我。”

“跟我一起下去吧，叔叔！”阿拉丁说。

“不行，只有你能做到这个，我的孩子。”阿巴那扎尔从手上摘下一枚金戒指交给阿拉丁，“这枚戒指具有魔力，能够保护你，”他说，“小心点儿，尽快把灯带给我。”

阿拉丁把戒指戴在左手的小指上，沿着台阶走了下去。里面很黑，他很害怕，但他更害怕阿巴那扎尔。

阿拉丁感到害怕是对的，因为阿巴那扎尔并不是他的叔叔。他是一个来自摩洛哥的魔法师，他非常想得到那盏灯。那是一盏神灯，只有这座城市里一个叫阿拉丁的穷孩子才能为他拿到。

阿拉丁下了100级台阶来到第一间屋子里。里面并不暗，他很快穿过那些屋子走进了花园。花园里有很多树，树上满是五颜六色的美丽果子——有白的、红的、绿的，还有黄的。

他很快就在其中的一棵树下找到了那盏灯。“为什么我叔叔想要这盏脏兮兮的破油灯呢？”他寻思。他把它装进口袋里，然后开始从树上摘果子，直到装满了衣服上的每个口袋。之后他返回到台阶那里开始向上爬。他很快就看到了阿巴那扎尔和蓝色的天空。

“把油灯给我，”阿巴那扎尔伸出手催促道，“快点，孩子，给我灯！”

阿拉丁拿不出灯，因为它被压在那些果子下面了。他看着阿巴那扎尔那张恼羞成怒的脸，害怕极了。

“先把我拉出去，你就能拿到那盏灯了，”他说，“求你了，叔叔！”

“先把灯给我！”阿巴那扎尔喊道，“给我灯！”

“不！”阿拉丁说。

“你这个没用的东西！你这条狗！你和那盏灯一起留在下面吧！”阿巴那扎尔气冲冲地跑到火边，又往里面撒了些药粉。“阿不拉卡达不拉 ！”他又念起了咒语。

白色的巨石重又盖住了洞口，阿拉丁此时看不到天空了。他被关在黑暗的地下，出不去了。

3The ring and the lamp

The ring and the lamp

'Uncle Abanazar! Uncle!' Aladdin hit the stone but nothing moved. 'Don't leave me here! Please!'

Aladdin put his ear to the stone, but he could hear nothing. 'I am Aladdin, son of Mustafa,' he said, and listened again. But the stone did not move.

Then Aladdin began to cry. 'What am I going to do?' he thought, and put his head in his hands.

After a time he began to feel hungry, and took some of the fruit out of his pocket. He put some in his mouth, but he could not eat them. 'These are stones, not fruit,' he thought. 'I'm going to die down here.'

For three days and three nights Aladdin sat on the stairs and waited, but no help came. On the third day he remembered Abanazar' s ring on his finger—the ring to protect him. He could not see the ring in the dark so he put his right hand on it...

WHOOSH!

There was a sudden noise, and blue smoke came out of the ring. And then, out of the smoke came a big jinnee.

'I am here, master, I am here,' the jinnee cried. 'I am the slave of the ring. What is your wish?'

Aladdin was very surprised, and very afraid. At first he could not speak, then he said, 'Take me out of here.'

'To hear is to obey,' the jinnee said, and a second later Aladdin was back on the hills under the blue sky.

There was nobody there, and the fire was cold and black. Happily, Aladdin began to walk home.

When he got there, his mother was very happy to see him. 'Oh, Aladdin!' she cried. 'What happened to you? And where is your uncle?'

'Abanazar is not my uncle, Mother. He is a magician and a bad man. He nearly killed me.' Then Aladdin told his mother all about the fire, the magic stone, and the garden under the ground. 'Oh, I am very tired, Mother,' he said. 'I must sleep.'

Aladdin closed his eyes and slept for many hours. The next morning he opened his eyes and said: 'Mother, I'm hungry!'

'My son, I'm sorry,' she said. 'We have no rice or meat in the house. We have nothing. I must sell your new coat and get some rice with the money.'

Then Aladdin remembered the lamp from the garden.

'Wait a minute, Mother,' he said. 'Take this lamp and sell that first.'

'That dirty old thing?' Aladdin's mother said. 'I must clean it first.' She began to rub it and...

WHOOSH ! Noise, fire, and red smoke came from the lamp, and out of the smoke came a very big jinnee.

'I am the slave of the lamp,' cried the jinnee. 'What is your wish, mistress?'

Aladdin's mother was afraid and could not speak, but Aladdin said, 'Bring rice and meat to us. We are hungry.'

The jinnee went away, and came back in a second with rice, meat, bread, and fruit on twelve gold plates. He put the plates in front of them and went away.

Aladdin and his mother ate and ate. Then Aladdin took one of the plates to the market and sold it for two pieces of gold.

Every day after that, Aladdin rubbed the lamp. And when the jinnee came, Aladdin said: 'Bring us rice and meat.' And every day he sold the gold plates.

Soon, Aladdin and his mother were rich.

3． 戒指和灯

“阿巴那扎尔叔叔！叔叔！”阿拉丁无助地敲打着纹丝不动的巨石，“不要把我丢在这里！求求你！”

阿拉丁把耳朵凑在石头上，但什么都听不到。“我是阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子。”他喊道，然后再凑上去听，但石头还是没有动。

阿拉丁开始哭了。“我该怎么办呢？”他把头埋在两手之中沉思起来。

过了一段时间，他感觉饿了，就从口袋里掏出一些摘来的果子。放进嘴里才发现根本咬不动。“这些东西都是石头，不是果子，”他想，“看来我要死在这下面了。”

阿拉丁坐在台阶上等了三天三夜，但没有人来救他。第三天的时候他想起了手上戴着的阿巴那扎尔给他的戒指——能够保护他的戒指。黑暗中他看不到戒指，所以他伸出右手去摸……

呼啦！

伴着这突如其来的声音，一股青烟从戒指里冒了出来。随后从烟雾里现出一个巨型的神灵。

“我来了，主人，我来了，”神灵喊道，“我是这戒指的奴仆。你有什么愿望？”

阿拉丁很惊讶，也很害怕。起初他说不出话来，但最后还是说道：“把我从这里带出去。”

“听到就得遵从。”戒指神说道。阿拉丁刹那间就回到山里的地面上，他又能看到蓝天了。

周围没有人，火堆里黑色的余烬已经冰凉了。阿拉丁高兴地走上了回家的路。

回到家，母亲见到他甭提有多高兴了。“哦，阿拉丁！”她哭道，“到底发生了什么事？你的叔叔呢？”

“阿巴那扎尔不是我的叔叔，妈妈。他是一个黑心的魔法师，他差点害死我。”接着阿拉丁就给母亲讲了火堆、巨石和地下花园的事。“哦，我非常累了，妈妈，”他说，“我得先睡一觉。”

阿拉丁闭上眼睛睡了好久好久。第二天早上他睁开眼睛就说：“妈妈，我好饿！”

“儿子，我很难过，”她说，“咱们家里没有米也没有肉，什么也没有。我必须把你的衣服卖掉去买些米来。”

这时阿拉丁想起了从花园里拿来的灯。

“等一下，妈妈，”他说，“先把这盏灯拿去卖了吧。”

“那个脏兮兮的旧东西？”阿拉丁的母亲说，“我得先把它擦干净。”她开始擦拭……

呼啦！ 声音、火焰、红色的烟雾同时从油灯里冒了出来，烟雾里现出一个巨大的神灵。

“我是这盏灯的奴仆，”神灵喊道，“你有什么愿望，夫人？”

阿拉丁的母亲吓得说不出话来，这时阿拉丁说：“给我们弄些米和肉来，我们很饿了。”

神灵走开了，转瞬间就用12个金盘子装着米、肉、面包和水果回来了。他把盘子放在他们面前就消失了。

阿拉丁和他母亲大吃了一顿。吃完后阿拉丁就拿着其中的一个盘子到市场上卖了两枚金币。

从那以后，阿拉丁每天都擦拭神灯。等神灵来了以后，阿拉丁就说：“给我们拿米和肉来。”每天他都把金盘子卖掉。

阿拉丁和母亲很快就变得富有起来。

4Aladdin's love

Aladdin's love

Five years later, Aladdin had a shop in the market and three market-sellers worked for him. The sellers liked Aladdin because he was good to them. The market children liked Aladdin too, because he gave them money when he walked past. Everybody liked Aladdin.

Aladdin's mother never called her son a good-for-nothing now. They had a nice house near the gardens and she had many beautiful things. But only Aladdin and his mother knew about the magic lamp and the jinnee.

One day Aladdin heard a noise in the street and stopped to listen. 'The Sultan's daughter is coming,' he heard. 'Princess Badr-al-Budur is coming!'

Six slaves carried the Princess through the streets in a litter, and the people stopped to watch. 'Princess! Princess Badr-al-Budur!' they called.

Aladdin watched when the litter came past him, and he saw the Princess's face. She was beautiful, with big dark eyes — the most beautiful woman in Arabia. The litter went past Aladdin, but for some minutes he did not move. Then he ran home.

'Mother! Mother! I saw the Sultan's daughter, Princess Badr-al-Budur, in the street.' Aladdin's face was white. 'I must have the Princess for my wife!'

'But, Aladdin...' his mother began.

'No "buts", Mother. I love the Princess and I want to marry her. Go to the Sultan and ask for me.'

'Me? Go to the Sultan's palace? No, no, no,' Aladdin's mother said. 'Listen, my son. The daughters of a Sultan do not marry poor boys from the city.'

'But we are not poor now, Mother. And we can give the Sultan something for his daughter. Wait.'

Aladdin went away and got the fruit from the magic garden under the ground. Now, of course, he knew it was not fruit, but white, red, green, and yellow jewels.

'Take these jewels, Mother, on a gold plate,' he said, 'and give them to the Sultan.'

So the next day Aladdin's mother carried a gold plate with many beautiful jewels on it to the Sultan's palace. She went into a long room, but when she saw the Sultan, his Vizier, and all his slaves, she was very afraid. So she waited quietly in the room and spoke to nobody. In the evening she went back home again with the jewels. Aladdin was very angry with her.

'Mother, you must speak to the Sultan,' he said. 'I have no father to do this for me. You must help me—I must marry the Princess. I love her!'

So the next day, and for many days after that, Aladdin's mother went to the palace, but she was always afraid to speak.

In the end, the Sultan saw her and asked his Vizier: 'Who is that woman? Why does she come to the palace every day?'

The Vizier spoke to Aladdin's mother: 'Do you want to speak to the Sultan? Yes? Come with me.'

The Vizier took Aladdin's mother to the Sultan, and she put her head on the ground at his feet.

'Get up, woman. Why do you come here every day?' the Sultan asked. 'Speak, woman.'

'Your Majesty,' Aladdin's mother said quietly, 'I have a son, a good young man. He is called Aladdin. He loves your daughter, Princess Badr-al-Budur. He cannot sleep or eat because of her. He wants to marry her.'

The Sultan laughed. 'What? Marry my daughter? Your son?'

'Your Majesty, these jewels are for you, from my son Aladdin.' And Aladdin's mother put the gold plate with the jewels in front of the Sultan's feet.

Everybody looked at the jewels, and the long room was suddenly very quiet. Then the Sultan spoke.

'These are very beautiful jewels,' he said. 'No man in Arabia has jewels more wonderful than these. Your son is a rich man — a good husband for my daughter.'

The Vizier did not like to hear this, because he wanted the Princess to marry his son.

'Your Majesty,' he said quietly in the Sultan's ear, 'my son is a rich man, too. Give him three months, and he can find better jewels than these.'

'Very well,' said the Sultan. And to Aladdin's mother he said: 'Your son must wait for three months, and then perhaps he can marry my daughter.'

Aladdin's mother went home to tell Aladdin, and the Vizier went away to speak to his son. And every day, for two months, the Vizier's son came to the Sultan and gave him gold, and jewels, and many beautiful things.

For two months Aladdin waited happily, but one day his mother came home from the market and said:

'Oh, Aladdin! Aladdin! The Princess is going to marry the Vizier's son! I heard it in the market. Everybody's talking about it.'

When Aladdin heard this, he was very unhappy. 'What can I do?' he thought. He put his head in his hands and thought for a long time. And when night came, he took out the magic lamp and rubbed it...

WHOOSH ! ' What is your wish, master?' said the jinnee of the lamp.

'Bring Princess Badr-al-Budur to me,' said Aladdin.

'To hear is to obey.'

In a second the jinnee was back with the Princess asleep in his arms. He put her carefully on a bed, and then the Princess opened her eyes and saw Aladdin.

'Who are you?' she asked, afraid.

Aladdin took her hand and looked into her eyes. 'My name is Aladdin, and I love you,' he answered. 'I cannot live without you, and I want to marry you.'

Badr-al-Budur saw the love in his eyes, and smiled.

She closed her eyes again, then the jinnee carried her back to the Sultan's palace. The next morning she remembered Aladdin's eyes. 'There is no love in the eyes of the Vizier's son,' she thought. 'He thinks only of gold and of jewels.' So the Princess went to her father.

'I do not want to marry the Vizier's son,' she said. 'I want Aladdin for my husband.'

The Sultan was very surprised. 'What can we do?' he said to his Vizier. 'My daughter wants to marry this man Aladdin. He is a rich man, it is true — but who is he?'

'Ask him,' said the Vizier quickly, 'for more of those beautiful jewels, on forty gold plates. And forty slave girls, with forty slaves. Nobody is that rich.'

'Very good,' smiled the Sultan, and said to his slaves: 'Bring Aladdin's mother to me.'

When Aiaddin's mother arrived, the Sultan said: 'So! Your son wants to marry my daughter. But first he must give me forty gold plates with jewels. Forty slave-girls, with forty slaves, must carry the plates to me. Then my daughter can be his wife.'

Aladdin's mother went home and told her son, and Aladdin smiled. This was easy for the jinnee of the lamp, of course, and the next day, when Aladdin went to the palace, everybody in the city came out to watch.

First came forty slave-girls in dresses of gold, and every girl carried a gold plate with wonderful jewels on it. After them walked forty slaves in coats of gold. And last came Aladdin, on a beautiful white horse.

'What do you say now?' the Sultan said quietly to the Vizier, when he saw all these wonderful things. 'Aladdin must marry my daughter. How can I say no?' And the Sultan went to Aladdin and took his hands. 'My son,' he said. 'You can marry my daughter tonight.'

'Tomorrow, Your Majesty,' said Aladdin. 'Because, before I marry your daughter, she must have a palace—the most beautiful palace in Arabia.'

The jinnee of the lamp worked all night, and the next morning the Sultan saw from his window a beautiful new palace, with gardens of fruit trees and flowers.

'Wonderful!' he said.

'Black magic!' said the Vizier quietly.

That night Aladdin married Badr-al-Budur and they lived happily in the new palace.

4． 阿拉丁的爱情

五年以后，阿拉丁在市场上开了一家店，有三个伙计为他干活。他们都喜欢阿拉丁，因为他对他们很好。市场里的孩子们也都喜欢阿拉丁，因为他走过的时候就会给他们钱。每个人都喜欢阿拉丁。

现在阿拉丁的母亲再也不说儿子没用了。他们在公园附近有一处很好的房子，阿拉丁的母亲也有了不少漂亮的家什。但只有阿拉丁和他母亲知道神灯和神灵的事。

一天，阿拉丁在街上听到一阵嘈杂声，于是停住脚步细听。“苏丹的女儿过来了，”他听到有人说，“白狄伦·布杜鲁公主过来了！”

6个仆人用轿子抬着公主从街道上走过，人们都驻足观望。“公主！白狄伦·布杜鲁公主！”他们欢呼道。

当轿子经过他身边时，阿拉丁看到了公主的脸。她很漂亮，眼睛又大又黑——她是阿拉伯最漂亮的女子。轿子过去好一会儿了，阿拉丁还是待在那儿没有动。然后他就飞奔回家。

“妈妈！妈妈！我在街上看到苏丹的女儿白狄伦·布杜鲁公主了。”阿拉丁脸色苍白，“我一定要娶公主为妻！”

“但是，阿拉丁……”他母亲说。

“没有什么'但是'，妈妈。我爱公主，我想娶她。你去苏丹那儿为我求亲吧。”

“我？去苏丹的王宫？不，不，不，”阿拉丁的母亲说，“听着，儿子。苏丹的女儿是不会嫁给穷小子的。”

“但我们现在并不穷，妈妈。我们能给苏丹一些求亲的礼物。等等。”

阿拉丁去把那些在地下花园里摘到的果子拿了出来。现在他当然明白了这些并不是果子，而是白色、红色、绿色和黄色的珠宝。

“用一个金盘子装着这些珠宝，妈妈，”他吩咐道，“去送给苏丹。”

第二天阿拉丁的母亲就托着装满漂亮珠宝的金盘子来到苏丹的宫殿里。她走进一间长长的屋子，可当她看到苏丹、他的大臣和众多的仆从时，害怕极了。所以她就一言不发地等在那里。傍晚时，她又带着珠宝回到了家里。阿拉丁很是生气。

“妈妈，你必须去和苏丹说，”他说道，“我没有父亲来为我做这件事，你必须帮助我——我必须娶到公主。我爱她！”

第二天和以后很多天，阿拉丁的母亲都去了宫里，但她总是不敢说话。

最后，苏丹注意到了她，就问他的大臣：“那个女人是谁？她为什么每天都到宫里来？”

大臣对阿拉丁的母亲说：“你想和苏丹说话吗？想？那就跟我来。”

大臣把阿拉丁的母亲带到苏丹的面前，她俯首贴地拜倒在苏丹的脚前。

“起来吧，老太太。你为什么每天都到这儿来呢？”苏丹问道，“说来听听。”

“陛下，”阿拉丁的母亲低声说道，“我有一个儿子，一个品行很好的年轻人，他叫阿拉丁。他爱上了您的女儿白狄伦·布杜鲁公主。他现在寝食不思，只想娶公主为妻。”

苏丹哈哈大笑起来。“什么？娶我的女儿？你儿子？”

“陛下，这些珠宝是我儿子阿拉丁敬献给您的。”说着，她把装满珠宝的金盘子放在苏丹的脚前。

所有的人都把目光转向了那些珠宝，长长的屋子里顿时静了下来。然后苏丹说话了。

“这些都是非常美丽的珠宝，”他说道，“整个阿拉伯都没有人拥有比这还棒的珠宝。你儿子很富有——会是我女儿的好丈夫。”

大臣听到这个很不高兴，因为他想让公主嫁给他的 儿子。

“陛下，”他对苏丹耳语道，“我儿子也很富有。给他三个月的时间，他能找到比这还要好的珠宝。”

“很好，”苏丹点头称是。然后他对阿拉丁的母亲说：“你儿子必须再等三个月，之后他也许就能够娶到我的女儿了。”

阿拉丁的母亲回家把这些告诉了阿拉丁，大臣也回去跟他儿子说了。之后的两个月里，大臣的儿子每天都要去觐见苏丹，献上金银珠宝和许多漂亮的物品。

阿拉丁高兴地等了两个月，但有一天他母亲从市场上回来对他说：

“不好了，阿拉丁！阿拉丁！公主要嫁给大臣的儿子了！我是在市场上听说的，人们都在谈论这件事。”

阿拉丁听了以后变得很郁闷。“我该怎么办呢？”他想。他两手托腮地想了很长时间。晚上他把神灯拿出来擦了擦……

呼啦 ！“你有什么愿望，主人？”灯神问道。

“把白狄伦·布杜鲁公主带到我这儿来。”阿拉丁说。

“听到就得遵从。”

顷刻间灯神就抱着熟睡的公主回来了。他把公主轻轻地放在床上，这时公主睁开眼睛看到了阿拉丁。

“你是谁？”她恐惧地问道。

阿拉丁拉起公主的手，看着她的眼睛。“我叫阿拉丁，我深爱着你，”他答道，“没有你我活不下去，我想娶你为妻！”

公主从他的眼神里看到了真情，释然地笑了。

她又闭上眼睛，灯神重又把她带回到苏丹的宫里。第二天一早她想起了阿拉丁的眼神。“大臣儿子的眼神里没有真情，”她暗自思忖道，“他只想着金银珠宝。”之后她就去找她的父亲。

“我不想嫁给大臣的儿子，”她说，“我想要阿拉丁做我的丈夫。”

苏丹很惊奇。“我们该怎么办呢？”他对大臣说，“我女儿想嫁给阿拉丁。他很富有，这不假——但他是谁呢？”

“向他要，”大臣很快地回答道，“向他要更多的珠宝，用40个金盘子装着。再要40个婢女和40个奴仆。没有人会那么 富有。”

“好主意，”苏丹笑道。然后对他的奴仆们说：“去把阿拉丁的母亲找来。”

阿拉丁的母亲来了以后，苏丹对她说：“听着！你儿子要想娶我的女儿，就必须再给我40盘珠宝，而且必须由40个婢女和40个奴仆送来。之后我的女儿就会成为他的妻子。”

阿拉丁的母亲回到家，把苏丹的要求告诉了他儿子，阿拉丁轻松地一笑。这个要求对于灯神来说当然是太容易了。第二天，当阿拉丁往宫里去的时候，城里所有的人都出来观看。

首先走来的是40个婢女，穿着黄金做成的礼服，每人都托着一个装满了珍稀珠宝的金盘子。在她们的后面是40个奴仆，都穿着用黄金做成的外套。阿拉丁骑着一匹白色的骏马，行进在队伍的最后面。

“你还有什么说的呢？”苏丹看到这么多珍稀珠宝后向大臣低声问道，“我女儿必须 嫁给阿拉丁。我怎么还能说不行呢？”苏丹走到阿拉丁面前拉起他的双手。“我的孩子，”他说，“你今晚就可以娶我的女儿了。”

“陛下，就改在明天吧，”阿拉丁说，“因为在我迎娶你的女儿之前，她必须拥有一座宫殿——阿拉伯最漂亮的宫殿。”

灯神彻夜忙碌。第二天一早，苏丹就看到窗外建起了一座崭新漂亮的宫殿，周围的花园里栽满了果树和鲜花。

“真是绝妙！”他惊叹道。

“巫术！”大臣低声说道。

当晚阿拉丁就和白狄伦·布杜鲁公主结了婚，他们住在新的宫殿里过着幸福的生活。

5New lamps for old

New lamps for old

Where was Abanazar all this time? When he could not get the lamp from Aladdin, he went home to Morocco. He was very angry with Aladdin. 'But the boy is dead now,' he thought. 'And perhaps next year I can go back and get the lamp.'

One day, he got out his seven black stones. These stones were magic, and when he put them in water, the water could tell him many things. Soon, he could see the magic lamp in the water, but it was not under the white stone in the Arabian hills. It was in a palace.

'How did this happen?' said Abanazar. 'I must go back to Arabia and find this palace.'

After some months he arrived again in the city in Arabia. Soon, he saw the new palace and asked a man in the street: 'Who lives there?'

'That's Aladdin's palace,' was the answer. 'Princess Badr-al-Budur's husband, a good man—and very rich!'

Abanazar said nothing and walked away. 'That lazy, good-for-nothing boy!' he thought angrily. 'So he has the magic lamp, and he knows about the jinnee! How can I get the lamp back?'

For the next week Abanazar watched Aladdin's palace. One day Aladdin and his friends left the palace to go hunting in the hills.

'Good,' Abanazar thought, 'now I can get the lamp.'

After Aladdin left, Princess Badr-al-Budur went into the palace gardens. She sat under a tree and looked at the flowers. Then she heard a noise in the street, and called her slave-girl, Fawzia.

'What's the matter? Who's making that noise?' she asked. 'Fawzia, go and look in the street.'

When Fawzia came back, she had a smile on her face.

'Mistress,' she said, 'the children in the street are laughing at an old man. He's selling lamps, but not for money. "New lamps for old," he cries. "Give me an old lamp, and you can have a new lamp." So everybody's getting new lamps.'

Badr-al-Budur laughed. 'Do we have an old lamp for him? Yes—my husband's old lamp! Go and get it.' The Princess knew nothing about the lamp or its magic.

Fawzia went into the palace and came back with Aladdin's lamp. 'Here it is, mistress,' she said.

'Go and give it to the old man.' The Princess laughed. 'Aladdin can have a nice new lamp!'

Fawzia went out into the street with the lamp. 'New lamps for old,' the old man called, and the children behind him laughed and called, 'New lamps for old.'

The old man (it was Abanazar, of course) saw the lamp in Fawzia's hands, and knew it at once, because of the picture in the water of his magic stones. He took the old lamp, gave a new lamp to Fawzia, and then quickly walked away. He walked out of the city into the hills. Then he took out the lamp and rubbed it...

WHOOSH ! At once the jinnee of the lamp came to him. 'I am here, master,' he said. 'What is your wish?'

'Carry Aladdin's palace, the Princess, and me back to Morocco at once,' Abanazar said. 'The Sultan can kill Aladdin for me.'

'To hear is to obey.'

In a second Abanazar, the palace, the gardens, and the Princess were in Morocco. And in front of the Sultan's palace there was now only a little red smoke.

5． 新灯换旧灯

阿巴那扎尔这段时间在哪儿呢？他没能从阿拉丁手里得到神灯，之后就返回摩洛哥的家去了。他对阿拉丁恨之入骨。“但那孩子已经死了，”他想，“也许明年我再回去的时候就可以得到那盏灯了。”

一天，他拿出七块黑色的石头，这些石头是有魔力的。他把石头放进水里，可以从水中看到很多东西。很快，他就看到了神灯，但不是在阿拉伯山里的白色巨石下面，而是在一座宫殿里。

“怎么会这样呢？”阿巴那扎尔自言自语道，“我必须回到阿拉伯，找到这座宫殿。”

几个月之后，他又回到了这个城市。他很快就找到了那座新的宫殿，他问街旁的一个人：“谁住在这座宫殿里呢？”

“那是阿拉丁的宫殿，”那人答道，“白狄伦·布杜鲁公主的丈夫，一个非常好的人，而且很富有！”

阿巴那扎尔一言不发地走开了。“那个懒惰的废物！”他忿忿地想道，“他得到了神灯，他知道了灯神的秘密！我怎样才能把灯夺回来呢？”

接下来的一周阿巴那扎尔都在阿拉丁的宫殿周围观察。一天，阿拉丁离开宫殿和他的朋友们到山里打猎去了。

“好啊，”阿巴那扎尔想，“这下我能够得到那盏灯了。”

阿拉丁走后，白狄伦·布杜鲁公主就去了宫殿的花园里。她坐在一棵树下观赏着鲜花。随后她听到街上传来一阵吵闹声，就把她的婢女法齐娅叫了过来。

“怎么回事啊？是谁在外面大喊大叫的？”她问道，“法齐娅，到街上去看看。”

法齐娅回来后，脸上挂着笑容。

“夫人，”她说，“是一群孩子在笑一个老头儿。他在卖油灯，但不要钱。'新灯换旧灯。'他这样喊道，'给我一个旧灯，你就可以拿走一盏新灯。'所以很多人都换到了新灯。”

白狄伦·布杜鲁公主也大笑了起来。“我们有旧灯换给他吗？对了——我丈夫的旧灯！快去把它拿来。”公主对神灯和它的魔力一无所知。

法齐娅回到宫里把阿拉丁的旧灯拿了出来。“拿来了，夫人。”她说。

“去把它拿给那个老头儿，”公主笑道，“阿拉丁可以有一盏漂亮的新灯了！”

法齐娅拿着灯来到街头。“新灯换旧灯。”老头儿喊道。跟在他后面的孩子们也边笑边喊：“新灯换旧灯。”

老头儿（当然是阿巴那扎尔）一看到法齐娅手中的灯，马上就认出它就是那盏神灯，因为他把魔石扔进水里后在水中看到过这盏灯。他取走旧灯，给了法齐娅一盏新灯后，很快就溜走了。他来到城外的山里，取出灯擦拭了一下……

呼啦 ！灯神马上来到他面前。“我来了，主人，”他说，“你有什么愿望？”

“马上把阿拉丁的宫殿、公主和我带回摩洛哥。”阿巴那扎尔吩咐道，“苏丹会替我杀了阿拉丁。”

“听到就得遵从。”

顷刻间阿巴那扎尔、宫殿、花园和公主就到了摩洛哥。在苏丹的宫殿前只剩下一缕红色的轻烟。

6There and back again

There and back again

In the evening Aladdin and his friends finished hunting and began to go home. Suddenly a friend said: 'Aladdin, look! The Sultan's men are coming, with swords in their hands. What do they want?'

'I don't know,' Aladdin answered.

When the Sultan's men arrived, they said: 'Aladdin, we must take you to the Sultan. He's very angry.'

'Why?' asked Aladdin, but the men could not tell him.

In his palace the Sultan took Aladdin to a window. 'Where is your palace?' he cried angrily. 'And where is my daughter? Answer me!'

Aladdin looked out of the window. There was only the ground and the sky—no palace, no gardens, nothing. He closed his eyes, opened them and looked again, and he had no answer for the Sultan.

'It's black magic. I always said that,' the Vizier said quietly in the Sultan's ear.

'Your Majesty.' Aladdin put his head at the Sultan's feet. 'Kill me now—I do not want to live without Badr-al-Budur.' There were tears in his eyes.

'Find her in forty days—or you die,' the Sultan said.

'I hear and obey, Your Majesty,' Aladdin answered.

But without his magic lamp, what could Aladdin do? He went out from the city, and looked and looked for his wife and his palace, but of course he did not find them. After thirty seven days he sat by a river and cried: 'Oh, Badr-al-Budur, my love! Where are you? Where can I look now?' He put his hands into the water of the river, and then he saw the magician's ring on his little finger. He began to rub it...

WHOOSH ! Out of the blue smoke came the jinnee of the ring. 'What is your wish, master?' he asked.

'Find my wife and bring her back to me,' answered Aladdin. 'Please...'

'Master, I cannot do that. The jinnee of the lamp took the Princess away, and only the jinnee of the lamp can bring her back. But I can take you to her.'

'Take me then—quickly!'

'To hear is to obey.'

It is many, many miles from Arabia to Morocco, but Aladdin was there in a second. And there was his palace, in front of him. He went into the gardens and looked up at the windows.

'Badr-al-Budur,' he cried, 'are you there?'

In the palace Badr-al-Budur heard him. 'Is that Aladdin?' she thought. 'But he is far away in Arabia.' She went to the window, opened it, and looked out.

'Aladdin!' she cried. 'Oh, my love!'

For the first time in many days, Aladdin smiled.

'Come up, quickly!' the Princess called. 'The magician is not here now.'

Her slave-girl ran down and opened a little door into the gardens. Aladdin ran up to the Princess's rooms, and in a second she was in his arms.

'Oh, my love,' the Princess said. 'A bad man carried me here. A magician. His name is—'

'His name is Abanazar and I am going to kill him,' said Aladdin. 'Tell me—does he have my old lamp?'

'Yes,' Badr-al-Budur said. 'He always carries it with him. I know about its magic now, because he told me. Oh, why did I give it away?'

'Listen, my love,' said Aladdin. 'I'm going to give you some sleeping-powder. When he comes here again, you must give him a drink and put the powder in it. When he is asleep, I can kill him. Don't be afraid. I'm going to take you home very soon. Now for some good magic.'

He began to rub his ring...

WHOOSH ! 'What is your wish, master?' said the jinnee of the ring.

'Bring me some sleeping-powder,' said Aladdin.

'To hear is to obey.'

In a second the jinnee was back with some sleeping powder. Then Aladdin and the Princess waited for Abanazar.

In the evening they heard him on the stairs.

'Don't be afraid,' Aladdin said quietly to his wife. 'I am in the next room and can be with you in a second.' He went quickly into the next room and stood behind the door.

Abanazar opened the door of Badr-al-Budur's room and came in. He smiled: 'You are more beautiful every day, Badr-al-Budur,' he said. 'Your husband, that good-for-nothing Aladdin, is dead now. You must marry me. You can have gold, jewels, palaces, anything! But you must be my wife.'

For the first time the Princess smiled at Abanazar.

'Why not?' she said. 'You are a rich man and I am happy here. Yes, let's drink to that.'

And she gave him a tall gold cup with the drink and the powder in it.

'Let us drink from one cup, Abanazar,' she said, and smiled at him. 'You first, then me. In my country new husbands and wives always do this.'

'To Badr-al-Budur, the most beautiful woman in Morocco,' Abanazar said happily, 'and my wife.'

He looked into Badr-al-Budur's eyes and began to drink. Very afraid, the Princess watched him. But it was a good sleeping-powder, and after five seconds Abanazar's eyes closed and he was asleep.

The Princess ran to the door of the next room.

'Quick, Aladdin,' she called.

Aladdin ran in with his sword and saw the sleeping magician. 'Well done, my love!' he said. 'Now, go into the next room and do not watch.'

Badr-al-Budur ran to the next room and closed the door. Aladdin put his hand in Abanazar's pocket and took out the lamp. He put it carefully into the pocket of his coat, and then stood up.

The sword did its work quickly, and Abanazar never opened his eyes again.

The Princess came back into the room, and ran to Aladdin. He took her in his arms.

'The magician is dead,' he said. 'And now we can go home.' He began to rub the lamp...

WHOOSH ! Fire and red smoke came from the lamp. The Princess watched, afraid.

'I am here, master,' said the jinnee of the lamp. 'What is your wish?'

'Carry this palace, Badr-al-Budur, and me back to our city in Arabia. But leave that dog, Abanazar, here.'

'To hear is to obey,' said the jinnee.

*　*　*

When the Sultan looked out of his window and saw Aladdin's palace again, he was a happy man. And when he took his daughter in his arms, he was the happiest man in Arabia.

From that day, Aladdin and Badr-al-Budur lived happily in their palace. They lived for many years, and had many children. But Aladdin always carried the magic lamp with him, day and night.

6． 去摩洛哥找回失去的

傍晚时分，阿拉丁和他的朋友们打完猎正往回走。突然一个朋友喊道：“阿拉丁，快看！苏丹的武士们来了，手里都拿着刀剑。他们想干什么？”

“我不知道啊。”阿拉丁答道。

武士们走近之后，说道：“阿拉丁，我们必须把你带到苏丹那里，他非常生气。”

“为什么？”阿拉丁诧异道，但武士们也回答不上来。

在王宫里，苏丹把阿拉丁带到窗前。“你的宫殿到哪儿去了？”他愤怒地喊道，“我的女儿到哪儿去了？赶快回答我！”

阿拉丁向窗外望去。他只能看到地面和天空——没有宫殿、没有花园，什么都没有。他使劲眨了眨眼睛再看，还是没有。对苏丹他无言以对。

“那是巫术。我一直是这么说的。”大臣对苏丹耳语道。

“陛下，”阿拉丁俯在苏丹的脚前，“现在就杀了我吧——没有白狄伦·布杜鲁公主我也不想活了！”他的眼里噙满了泪水。

“限你在40天之内找到她——不然你就死定了。”苏丹说。

“遵命，陛下。”阿拉丁答道。

但没有神灯，阿拉丁能做什么呢？他出了城找啊找啊，找她的妻子和宫殿，但他当然是找不到。37天过去了，他坐在一条河边无助地哭喊道：“哦，白狄伦·布杜鲁公主啊，我的至爱！你在哪儿呢？让我到哪儿去找你呢？”他说着把手伸进了河水里，这时他看到了小指上魔法师给的戒指。他连忙伸手去擦拭……

呼啦 ！戒指神从蓝色的烟雾里现了出来。“你有什么愿望，主人？”他问道。

“找到我妻子并把她带回来，”阿拉丁答道，“求你了……”

“主人，我做不到。是灯神把公主带走的，也只有灯神能够把她带回来。不过我可以把你带到公主那儿去。”

“那就带我去——赶快！”

“听到就得遵从。”

从阿拉伯到摩洛哥相隔千山万水，但阿拉丁刹那之间就到了。他的宫殿就在他面前。他走进花园里，抬头往窗户里看去。

“白狄伦·布杜鲁，”他喊道，“你在那儿吗？”

正在里面的公主听到了他的声音。“是阿拉丁吗？”她想，“可他在遥远的阿拉伯啊。”她走到窗前，打开窗户向外看去。

“阿拉丁！”她叫了起来，“哦，亲爱的！”

这么多天来，阿拉丁第一次露出了笑容。

“快上来！”公主喊道，“魔法师现在不在这儿。”

她的婢女跑下去打开了通往花园的一扇小门。阿拉丁跑到公主的房间里，公主马上扑到了他的怀里。

“哦，我心爱的，”公主说道，“一个坏蛋把我带到了这里。他是个魔法师，名字叫——”

“他叫阿巴那扎尔，我要宰了他。”阿拉丁说，“告诉我——他拿了我的旧油灯了吗？”

“是的，”公主答道，“他总是把它带在身边。我现在知道它具有魔力了，因为魔法师跟我说了。天呐，我为什么要把它送给别人呢？”

“听着，亲爱的，”阿拉丁说，“我要给你一些催眠药粉。他回来以后，你必须向他敬一杯酒，并且把药粉放在里面。等他睡熟后，我就能杀死他了。千万别害怕。我很快就会带你回家。现在我来使一个小魔法。”

他伸手去擦拭戒指……

呼啦 ！“你有什么愿望，主人？”戒指神问道。

“给我找些催眠药粉来。”阿拉丁说。

“听到就得遵从。”

很快，戒指神就弄来一些催眠药粉。阿拉丁和公主一起等着阿巴那扎尔的归来。

傍晚时分，他们终于听到了他上楼梯的声音。

“不要害怕，”阿拉丁悄声地对妻子说，“我就在隔壁的房间里，随时可以过来帮助你。”他很快地躲到隔壁房间的门后。

阿巴那扎尔打开白狄伦·布杜鲁公主的房门走了进来。他谄笑道：“你一天比一天漂亮了，白狄伦·布杜鲁公主。你的丈夫，那个叫阿拉丁的废物已经死了。你必须嫁给我。你可以拥有金银、珠宝、宫殿，所有的一切！但你必须做我的妻子。”

公主第一次对阿巴那扎尔露出了笑容。

“为什么不呢？”她欣然说道，“你很富有，我在这儿也很高兴。好，那就让我们为这个喝一杯吧。”

她递给他一个高脚金杯，里面盛着掺了药粉的酒。

“我们就用一个杯子喝吧，阿巴那扎尔，”她对他微笑道，“你先喝，我后喝。在我们国家，新婚夫妇都是这样做的。”

“为白狄伦·布杜鲁，摩洛哥最漂亮的女人，”阿巴那扎尔高兴地说，“我的妻子。”

他看着白狄伦·布杜鲁的眼睛，开始饮酒。公主也看着他，心里害怕极了。但催眠药粉的效果非常好，五秒钟之后阿巴那扎尔就闭上眼睛睡熟了。

公主跑到隔壁的门口。

“快，阿拉丁！”她喊道。

阿拉丁提着剑跑进屋里，看到了熟睡的魔法师。“好样的，亲爱的！”他说，“现在你到隔壁去，别看着。”

公主跑到隔壁把门关上。阿拉丁把手伸进阿巴那扎尔的口袋里，掏出了神灯，然后小心地把它放进自己的外衣口袋里，站了起来。

阿拉丁手起剑落，阿巴那扎尔就再也没有睁开眼睛了。

公主跑回房间里，扑向阿拉丁。他把她紧紧地抱在怀里。

“魔法师死了，”他说，“现在我们回家。”他把神灯拿出来擦拭……

呼啦 ！火光和红色的烟雾从灯里冒了出来。公主很害怕地看着。

“我来了，主人，”灯神说道，“你有什么愿望？”

“把这座宫殿、白狄伦·布杜鲁公主，还有我带回阿拉伯我们的城市里，但把阿巴那扎尔这条狗留在这儿。”

“听到就得遵从。”灯神说道。

*　*　*

苏丹重又看到窗外阿拉丁的宫殿时，很是高兴。拥抱着女儿时，他就是整个阿拉伯最幸福的人了。

从那天起，阿拉丁就和白狄伦·布杜鲁公主幸福地生活在他们的宫殿里。他们活了很多年，有了很多孩子。但阿拉丁日夜都把神灯带在身边。

内容简介

“女孩儿突然用手捧住尼克的脸，吻了他的嘴唇。‘开车小心点儿，好莱坞先生。再见！’女孩儿带着甜甜的微笑说，然后转过身迅速离去了。”

尼克·洛茨感到莫名其妙。仅仅十分钟前，女孩来到咖啡馆坐在了他旁边，尼克这才认识她的。可她离去时为什么吻了他？她为什么叫他“好莱坞先生”？在开车去温哥华的路上他一直思考着这些问题，可始终找不到答案。其实，这里还有一件事尼克不知道。

当女孩对尼克说再见时有人在旁边正听着呢——这个人对“好莱坞先生”这个称呼很感兴趣。在温哥华，尼克很快便得知那个人的兴趣于己不利……

GOODBYE, MR HOLLYWOOD

'The girl suddenly took Nick's face between her hands, and kissed him on the mouth. "Drive carefully, Mr Hollywood. Goodbye," she said, with a big, beautiful smile. Then she turned and walked quickly away.'

Nick Lortz doesn't understand. He only met the girl ten minutes ago when she came and sat next to him in the café. So why does she kiss him when she leaves? And why does she call him 'Mr Hollywood'? He thinks about these questions when he is driving to Vancouver, but he doesn't find the answers. And there is one more thing that Nick doesn't know.

Somebody is listening when the girl says goodbye to him—somebody who is very interested in the name 'Mr Hollywood'. And in Vancouver Nick soon learns that it's not a friendly interest...

1Mystery girl

Mystery girl

It all began on a beautiful spring morning in a village called Whistler, in Canada—a pretty little village in the mountains of British Columbia.

There was a café in the village, with tables outside, and at one of these tables sat a young man. He finished his breakfast, drank his coffee, looked up into the blue sky, and felt the warm sun on his face. Nick Lortz was a happy man.

The waiter came up to his table. 'More coffee?' he asked.

'Yeah. Great,' said Nick. He gave the waiter his coffee cup.

The waiter looked at the camera on the table. 'On vacation?' he said. 'Where are you from?'

'San Francisco,' Nick said. He laughed. 'But I'm not on vacation—I'm working. I'm a travel writer, and I'm doing a book on mountains in North America. I've got some great pictures of your mountain.'

The two men looked up at Whistler Mountain behind the village. It looked very beautiful in the morning sun.

'Do you travel a lot, then?' asked the waiter.

'All the time,' Nick said. 'I write books, and I write for travel magazines. I write about everything—different countries, towns, villages, rivers, mountains, people...'

The waiter looked over Nick's head. 'There's a girl across the street,' he said. 'Do you know her?'

Nick turned his head and looked. 'No, I don't.'

'Well, she knows you, I think,' the waiter said. 'She's watching you very carefully.' He gave Nick a smile. 'Have a nice day!' He went away, back into the café.

Nick looked at the girl across the street. She was about twenty-five, and she was very pretty. 'She is watching me,' Nick thought. Then the girl turned and looked in one of the shop windows. After a second or two, she looked back at Nick again.

Nick watched her. 'She looks worried,' he thought. 'What's she doing? Is she waiting for somebody?'

Suddenly, the girl smiled. Then she walked across the street, came up to Nick's table, and sat down. She put her bag down on the table. The bag was half-open.

'Hi! I'm Jan,' she said. 'Do you remember me? We met at a party in Toronto.'

'Hi, Jan,' said Nick. He smiled. 'I'm Nick. But we didn't meet at a party in Toronto. I don't go to parties very often, and never in Toronto.'

'Oh,' the girl said. But she didn't get up or move away.

'Have some coffee,' said Nick. The story about the party in Toronto wasn't true, but it was a beautiful morning, and she was a pretty girl. 'Maybe it was a party in Montréal. Or New York.'

The girl laughed. 'OK. Maybe it was. And yes, I'd love some coffee.'

When she had her coffee, Nick asked, 'What are you doing in Whistler? Or do you live here?'

'Oh no,' she said. 'I'm just, er, just travelling through. And what are you doing here?'

'I'm a travel writer,' Nick said, 'and I'm writing a book about famous mountains.'

'That's interesting,' she said. But her face was worried, not interested, and she looked across the road again.

A man with very short, white hair walked across the road. He was about sixty years old, and he was tall and thin. The girl watched him.

'Are you waiting for someone?' asked Nick.

'No,' she said quickly. Then she asked, 'Where are you going next, Nick?'

'To Vancouver, for three or four days,' he said.

'When are you going?' she asked.

'Later this morning,' he said. There was a letter in the top of the girl's half-open bag. Nick could see some of the writing, and he read it because he saw the word 'Vancouver'—... and we can meet at the Empress Hotel, Victoria, Vancouver Island, on Friday afternoon ...

'So she's going to Vancouver too,' he thought.

Suddenly the girl said, 'Do you like movies?'

'Movies? Yes, I love movies,' he said. 'Why?'

'I know a man, and he—he loves movies, and going to the cinema,' she said slowly. 'People call him "Mr Hollywood".' She smiled at Nick. 'Can I call you "Mr Hollywood" too?'

Nick laughed. 'OK,' he said. 'And what can I call you?'

She smiled again. 'Call me Mystery Girl,' she said.

'That's a good name for you,' said Nick.

Just then, the man with white hair came into the café. He did not look at Nick or the girl, but he sat at a table near them. He asked the waiter for some breakfast, then he began to read a magazine.

The girl looked at the man, then quickly looked away again.

'Do you know him?' Nick asked her.

'No,' she said. She finished her coffee quickly and got up. 'I must go now,' she said.

Nick stood up, too. 'Nice to—' he began.

But the girl suddenly took his face between her hands, and kissed him on the mouth. 'Drive carefully, Mr Hollywood. Goodbye,' she said, with a big, beautiful smile. Then she turned and walked quickly away.

Nick sat down again and watched her. She walked down the road and into a big hotel.

'Now what,' thought Nick, 'was that all about?'

*　　*　　*

The man with white hair watched Nick and waited. After four or five minutes, Nick finished his coffee, took his books and his camera, and left the café. His car was just outside the girl's hotel, and he walked slowly along the street to it.

The man with white hair waited a second, then quickly followed Nick.

From a window high up in the hotel, the girl looked down into the road. She saw Nick, and the man with white hair about fifty yards behind him. Nick got into his car, and the man with white hair walked quickly to a red car across the street. Five seconds later Nick drove away in his blue car, and the red car began to follow him.

When the girl saw this, she smiled, then went to put some things in her travel bag.

1．神秘女孩儿

故事发生在一个美丽春日的早晨，地点是加拿大一个叫惠斯勒的村庄——这是一个美丽的小村庄，坐落在不列颠哥伦比亚省的山区。

村子里有个咖啡馆，外面摆着几张桌子，一个年轻人坐在一张桌子旁。他吃完了早餐，喝完了咖啡，抬头看看湛蓝的天空，阳光照在他脸上，暖暖的。他叫尼克·洛茨，是个快乐的人。

服务员走到他的桌子旁。“再来点儿咖啡吗？”他问道。

“是的，太好了。”尼克说着，把咖啡杯递给了服务员。

服务员看看桌子上的照相机。“来度假的吧？”他问道，“你是从哪里来的？”

“旧金山。”尼克答道。接着又笑了，“不过我不是度假的——我是在工作。我是个旅行作家，正在写一本关于北美山岳的书。我已经拍了一些你们这里的山的照片，很棒。”

两人抬头看着村子后面的惠斯勒山。晨光中的惠斯勒山显得非常美丽。

“那你是不是经常旅行？”服务员问道。

“我一直在旅行，”尼克说，“我写书，还给旅游杂志撰稿。我什么都写——不同的国家、城镇、村庄、河流、山脉，还有人们……”

服务员从尼克的头上往他身后看过去。“街对面有个女孩儿，”他说，“你认识她吗？”

尼克扭过头去看了看。“不认识。”

“不过，我想她认识你，”服务员说道，“她在很认真地观察你。”他朝尼克笑了笑，“祝你今天过得开心！”他走开了，回到了咖啡馆里。

尼克看了看街对面的那个女孩儿。她大概有25岁，长得非常漂亮。“她确实在 看我。”尼克想。这时女孩儿转身朝商店的一个橱窗看去。过了一会儿她又转回来看着尼克。

尼克打量着她。“她看起来很焦虑，”他想，“她在干什么？在等人吗？”

突然，女孩儿笑了。接着她穿过街道来到尼克的桌子旁坐了下来。她把提包放在桌子上，提包半开着。

“你好！我叫简，”她说道，“你还记得我吗？我们在多伦多的一次聚会上见过。”

“你好，简，”尼克应道。他笑了笑，“我叫尼克。可是我们没有在多伦多的什么聚会上见过。我不常参加聚会，更没去多伦多参加过聚会。”

“哦。”女孩儿说道。但是她并没有起身，也没有离开。

“喝点儿咖啡吧。”尼克说道。多伦多聚会的故事并不是真的，可当时是个美丽的早晨，还有一个漂亮的女孩儿，“可能我们是在蒙特利尔或者纽约的聚会上见过。”

女孩儿笑了。“哦，可能是吧。对了，给我来点儿咖啡吧。”

她喝咖啡的时候，尼克问道：“你来惠斯勒做什么？还是说你住在这里？”

“哦，不，”她说，“我只是，呃，只是旅行经过这里。对了，你 在这里做什么？”

“我是一个旅行作家，”尼克说道，“我正在写一本关于名山的书。”

“那一定很有意思。”她说道。但她脸上的表情并不是感兴趣，而是焦虑，而且她又往马路的对面看了看。

一个留着白色短发的男人穿过马路。他有60岁上下，长得高高瘦瘦的。女孩儿在看他。

“你在等人吗？”尼克问道。

“没有。”女孩儿迅速地回答道。接着又问：“你下一站去哪儿，尼克？”

“去温哥华，待上三四天。”他说道。

“什么时候出发？”女孩儿问道。

“今天上午晚些时候。”他说。女孩儿半开着的提包里的最上面有一封信。尼克能看到上面的一些字，他默读着，因为他看到了“温哥华”这几个字——……我们可于星期五下午在温哥华岛维多利亚的皇后酒店见面……

“那她也要去温哥华喽。”他想。

女孩儿突然问道：“你喜欢电影吗？”

“电影？是的，我喜欢电影。”他回答道，“为什么问我这个？”

“我认识一个人，他——他喜欢电影，也喜欢去电影院，”她不慌不忙地说道，“人们都叫他‘好莱坞先生’。”她冲尼克笑了笑，“我也叫你‘好莱坞先生’可以吗？”

尼克笑了。“可以，”他说道，“那我怎么称呼你呢？”

她又笑了。“叫我神秘女孩儿吧。”她说道。

“这名字挺适合你的。”尼克说道。

就在这时，那个白发男人进了咖啡馆。他没有看尼克和那个女孩儿，但坐在了离他们不远的一张桌子旁。他向服务员要了一些早餐，接着开始看一本杂志。

女孩儿看了看那个男的，目光又迅速地转到了一旁。

“你认识他吗？”尼克问她。

“不认识。”她回答。她迅速喝完了咖啡，站起身来。“我现在得走了。”她说道。

尼克也站了起来。“很高兴——”他开口说道。

但是女孩儿突然用手捧住尼克的脸，吻了他的嘴唇。“开车小心点儿，好莱坞先生。再见！”女孩儿带着甜甜的微笑说，然后转过身迅速离去了。

尼克又坐了下来，注视着她。她沿着马路走进了一家大酒店。

“这是……”尼克想道，“这 都是怎么回事？”

*　　*　　*

那个白发男人看了看尼克，他在等待着什么。过了四五分钟，尼克喝完咖啡，拿了书和照相机，离开了咖啡馆。他的车就停在女孩儿去的那个酒店外面，他沿着大街不慌不忙地向自己的车走去。

白发男人等了一下，迅速跟在了尼克的后面。

女孩儿从酒店高处的一个窗户向马路看下去。她看到了尼克和跟在他后面大约50码远的白发男人。尼克钻进了自己的车里，那个白发男人马上朝街对面一辆红色的汽车走去。五秒钟后尼克开动了他那辆蓝色的汽车，而那辆红色的汽车开始尾随在他后面。

女孩儿看到这些，笑了，接着走开去往旅行包里装起东西来。

2A hand in the back

A hand in the back

That evening, in his hotel room in Vancouver, Nick could not stop thinking about the girl in the Whistler café. Why did she come and sit with him? She didn't know him, and that story about a party in Toronto wasn't true. And she was worried about something. But what?

And that kiss! It was nice, of course, but why did she do it? 'Maybe she liked my face,' Nick thought. 'Or my brown eyes. But I'm not going to see her again, so it doesn't matter. Forget it.'

He put some money in his pocket and went downstairs to the hotel restaurant. But there were no free tables, so he walked down to Gastown and found a restaurant there.

After dinner, he went for a walk. Vancouver was a friendly city, and Nick liked walking through Gastown and Chinatown, looking in the shops and watching the people. It was nearly dark now, and it was a busy time of the evening. There were a lot of cars, and a lot of people.

After a time, Nick began to walk back to his hotel. He came to a busy street, and waited, with a small crowd of people, to go across. A tall woman in a blue dress stood next to him. She turned and smiled at him.

'It's the first warm evening of spring,' she said. 'It's nice to be out, after the long cold winter.'

'Yeah,' said Nick. 'It's great. It's—'

Suddenly, there was a hand in his back—and the hand pushed Nick into the road. Nick fell on his face, in front of a big green car.

People screamed.

But the green car stopped, only inches from Nick's head. The woman in the blue dress ran into the road and pulled Nick to his feet.

'Are you OK? What happened?' she said.

The driver of the green car shouted angrily at Nick, but Nick did not hear him.

'Somebody pushed me,' he said to the woman. 'I didn't fall—somebody pushed me!'

'Pushed you?' said the woman. 'Who? I didn't see anybody.'

Nick looked at the faces of the people near him, but he didn't know them.

Then he saw a man's back. The man was tall and thin, and had very short white hair. He walked quickly away down the street, and did not look back.

'Hey, you!' Nick shouted. 'Wait!'

But the man did not stop, and he was soon lost in the crowds.

'Did he push you?' asked the woman in the blue dress.

'I... I don't know,' Nick said.

'Do you know him?' she asked.

'I don't know his name,' Nick said. 'But I know that short white hair. Now where did I see it before?'

The woman began to move away. 'I must get home,' she said. 'Are you OK now?'

'Yeah, I'm OK,' Nick said. 'And thanks. Thanks for your help.'

'That's OK.' the woman smiled. 'Be careful now!'

*　　*　　*

Back in his hotel, Nick sat on his bed and thought. 'It was an accident. Nobody pushed me, it was an accident. Nobody wants to kill me. And there are hundreds of men in Vancouver with white hair.'

It was one o'clock in the morning, but Nick couldn't sleep. He listened to the cars in the road, and he looked at the night sky through his hotel room window.

Then he sat at the table and tried to write some more of his book about mountains, but he couldn't think about his work. He got back into bed.

There were four or five magazines in the hotel room. They were not very interesting, but Nick sat in bed and opened one... and saw a photo of 'Mystery Girl' !

He looked at the picture very carefully. But, yes, it was her! Jan, the girl from the Whistler café.

She was next to a man of about fifty or fifty-five, and they were in the garden of a big, expensive house. They smiled at the camera, and they looked very happy.

Canadian millionaire, Howard Hutson, and his daughter, Meg , it said under the picture, at their home in Toronto . Meg Hutson! Not Jan. Not Mystery Girl. Meg Hutson, the daughter of a millionaire! Nick read it again.

'Why did she come and sit with me in the café at Whistler?' he thought. 'Millionaires' daughters don't sit with strangers in cafés, and then give them a big kiss when they leave! Why did she do it? What did she want?'

*　　*　　*

He thought back to the café in Whistler, and the girl next to him at the table. Then he remembered something. He remembered a man at a table near them in the café. A tall thin man, about sixty years old. A man with very short white hair.

Nick didn't sleep much that night.

2．背后的黑手

那天晚上，在温哥华的酒店房间里，尼克一直在想着在惠斯勒那家咖啡馆里遇到的那个女孩儿。她为什么要过来跟他坐在一起？她不认识他，那个多伦多聚会的事也是无中生有。当时有什么事情让她很焦虑。可到底是什么事呢？

还有那个吻！当然是很甜蜜的一个吻，但她为什么要那样做呢？“也许她喜欢我的脸，”尼克想道，“或者是我棕色的眼睛。可是我不会再见到她了，所以也没什么。算了吧。”

他拿了一些钱放进口袋里，下楼去了酒店的餐厅。可是那里没有空餐桌了，于是他步行去加斯敦街，在那里找了一家餐馆。

晚饭后他出去散了散步。温哥华是个友好的城市，尼克很喜欢在加斯敦街和唐人街逛，看看这里的商店，观察观察这里的人们。天色快要黑下来了，这正是夜晚繁忙的时候。到处都有很多的车、很多的人。

过了一会儿，尼克开始返回他落脚的酒店。他来到一条繁华的街道，和一小群人一道停下来等着过街。一个身着蓝色衣服的高个子女人站在他的旁边。她转过身来冲他笑了笑。

“这是开春来第一个温暖的夜晚，”她说道，“漫长寒冷的冬天过后出来走走真好。”

“是的，”尼克答道，“这样太好了。这样——”

突然，从尼克背后伸过来一只手——那只手把尼克狠狠地推到了马路上。尼克趴在了地上，刚好倒在一辆绿色汽车的前面。

人们尖叫起来。

但是那辆绿色的汽车停住了，离尼克的脑袋只有几英寸远。穿蓝衣服的女人跑到马路上把尼克扶了起来。

“你没事吧？怎么回事？”她问道。

绿色汽车的司机生气地冲尼克喊着，可是尼克并不理会他。

“有人推我，”他对那个女人说，“不是我自己摔倒的——有人推我！”

“推你？”女人问道，“谁呀？我谁也没有看到。”

尼克看看周围人的脸，可是他根本不认识那些人。

接着，他看到了一个人的背影。那个人高高瘦瘦的，留着非常短的白发。他沿着街道迅速地走开了，连看都没有回头看一眼。

“喂，你！”尼克大喊，“等等！”

可是那个人没有止步，并迅速地消失在人群中。

“是他 推你的吗？”蓝衣女人问道。

“我……我不知道。”尼克答道。

“你认识他吗？”她接着问。

“我不知道他的名字，”尼克答道，“可是我认得出他的白色短发。我在哪儿见过这白发呢？”

女人要走了。“我得回家了，”她说道，“你现在没事了吧？”

“是的，没事了，”尼克答道，“谢谢你了。谢谢你的帮助。”

“不用客气。”女人笑着答道，“从现在开始要小心点儿喽！”

*　　*　　*

回到酒店，尼克坐在床上想着：“应该是个意外。没有人推我，这是个意外。没有人要害我。何况温哥华有成百上千的人有白头发。”

已经是凌晨1点钟了，但尼克始终不能入睡。他听着街上的汽车声，透过房间的窗户望着夜空。

于是他坐在桌子旁，试图继续往下写他的关于名山的书，可是他无法静下心来进行工作。他又回到了床上。

酒店房间里有四五本杂志。杂志并没有多大意思，可是当尼克坐在床上翻开其中一本时……居然看到了一张“神秘女孩儿”的照片 ！

他非常仔细地看了那张照片。可是，没错，就是她！简，在惠斯勒的咖啡馆里遇到的那个女孩儿。

她坐在一个大约50到55岁的男人旁边，他们当时是在一幢很大很豪华的房子的花园里。他们对着镜头笑着，显得非常快乐。

“加拿大百万富翁霍华德·赫特森和他的女儿梅格 ，”照片下面这样写着，“在他们多伦多的家里 。”梅格·赫特森！不是简，也不是什么神秘女孩儿，而是梅格·赫特森，百万富翁的女儿！尼克又看了一遍。

“为什么在惠斯勒的咖啡馆里她过来坐在我 身边？”他这样想着，“百万富翁的女儿是不会在咖啡馆里跟陌生人坐在一起的，更不会在临走时给他们一个深深的吻！她为什么要这么做？她想干什么？”

*　　*　　*

他又回想起惠斯勒的那家咖啡馆和坐在他身旁的那个女孩儿。接着他又回想起另外一件事。他想起当时咖啡馆里坐在他们不远处的一个男人。那个高高瘦瘦、60岁上下留着白色短发的男子。

尼克那天晚上没怎么睡。

3A walk in the park

A walk in the park

The next day was Thursday. Nick stayed in his hotel room and wrote about mountains all morning. Then he drove to Stanley Park in the afternoon. He sat and read a book for an hour, then he went for a walk under the tall trees.

There was nobody here. It was quiet, and he could walk and think. He thought about Meg Hutson, and about the man with white hair. Did he know Meg Hutson? Did she know him? He remembered Meg Hutson's last words. Drive carefully, Mr Hollywood .

Why did she say that? Why did she call him Mr Hollywood? He didn't understand any of it.

Suddenly, he heard a noise.

He stopped. 'That was a gun!' he thought. 'There's somebody in the trees with a gun! There it is again!'

Then something hit the tree over his head.

'Somebody's shooting at me!' Nick thought. He turned and run.

And somebody began to run after him.

Nick ran through the trees. There was no sun in here, and it was half-dark. And there were no people. Nobody to help him.

'I must get to my car,' Nick thought. 'Find some people... the police...' He ran on.

He could still hear the gunman behind him, so he ran faster. After three or four minutes, he stopped and listened.

Nothing. It was all quiet.

Nick was afraid. 'What's happening?' he thought. 'Why is somebody shooting at me? First a hand pushes me in front of a car, and now somebody's shooting at me!'

He waited another second or two, then walked quickly back to his car. He was very careful. He looked and listened all the time. But nobody came out of the trees, and nobody shot at him. Then he saw people—women with young children, some boys with a football, two men with a dog. He began to feel better. 'Nobody can shoot me now,' he thought. 'Not with all these people here.'

Ten minutes later, he was back at his car.

There was a letter on the window. Nick read it. It said:

I'm going to kill you, Mr Hollywood.

*　　*　　*

Nick drove to the nearest police station. He waited for half an hour, then a tired young policeman took him into a small room. Nick told his story, and the policeman wrote it all down.

'So what are you going to do?' asked Nick.

'Nothing,' said the policeman.

'Nothing!' said Nick. 'But somebody shot at me, and—'

'Mr Lortz,' the policeman said tiredly. 'How many people are there in this town with guns?'

'I don't know,' said Nick. 'But...'

'You didn't see the gunman. Was it a man, a boy, a woman? Colour of eyes? Long hair, short hair? You don't know, because you didn't see anybody. Maybe it was an old girlfriend. Maybe somebody doesn't like your travel books, Mr Lortz.'

'But what about the man with white hair in Whistler?' said Nick. 'The girl, Meg Hutson, called me Mr Hollywood in the café, and this man heard her. And now I get a letter to Mr Hollywood on my car. Who is this Mr Hollywood?'

'We all want answers to our questions, Mr Lortz,' the policeman said, 'but we don't always get them.'

Questions. But no answers.

Nick walked out of the police station and drove to his hotel. He was angry, and afraid.

'How did the man with white hair find me in Vancouver?' he thought. 'Did he follow me from Whistler? Is he following me now? Maybe he's staying at my hotel, too. In the next room. With his gun.'

3．公园漫步

第二天是星期四。尼克整个上午都待在酒店的房间里写他的关于名山的书。下午他便开车去斯坦利公园。他坐下来看了一个小时的书，接着走进树木高大的林子里散步。

树林里没有人。四周非常安静，让他可以边走边思考问题。他想起了梅格·赫特森，还有那个留着白头发的人。他认识梅格·赫特森吗？她又认识他吗？他想起了梅格·赫特森最后对他说的话。“开车小心点儿，好莱坞先生 。”

她为什么那样说？她为什么叫他好莱坞先生？他怎么也弄不明白。

突然，他听到一声响。

他停了下来。“是枪声！”他想，“树林里有人带枪！又是一声枪响！”

接着有东西打到他头顶的树干上。

“有人在开枪打我！”尼克想着，转身就跑。

紧接着就有人开始在后面追他。

尼克穿过树林。树林里没有阳光，非常昏暗。也没有人，没有人能帮他。

“我必须回到我的车上去，”尼克这样想着，“找一些人来……去找警察……”他继续往前奔跑。

他仍能听到持枪的人在后面追他，于是他跑得更快了。过了三四分钟以后，他停下来四下里听了听。

什么也没有。四周静悄悄的。

尼克非常害怕。“出什么事了？”他想，“为什么有人开枪打我？起初有人把我往车前推，现在又有人开枪打我！”

他又等了一会儿，接着快步走回停车的地方。他非常谨慎，不时地四下张望着、听着。可是再也没有人从树林里出来，更没有人朝他开枪。接着他看到了人——带着小孩的妇女、踢球的男孩子们和两个遛狗的男子。他开始感觉好些了。“现在没人能开枪打我了，”他想道，“有这么多人，肯定没人会开枪打我了。”

10分钟后他回到了汽车旁。

车窗上有一封信，尼克看了看。上面写道：

我要杀了你，好莱坞先生。

*　　*　　*

尼克开车去了最近的一个警察局。他等了半个小时，接着一个看上去很疲倦的年轻警察把他领到一个小房间里。尼克讲了刚才的事情，警察做了记录。

“你们准备怎么处理此事？”尼克问道。

“没什么可处理的。”警察说。

“没什么可处理的！”尼克说道，“可有人开枪打我呀，还有——”

“洛茨先生，”警察懒懒地说，“这个城镇里有多少人有枪？”

“我不知道，”尼克回答，“可……”

“你没有看见那个持枪者呀。那个人是男是女还是小孩子？眼睛是什么颜色的？长发还是短发？你不知道，因为你谁也没有看到。或许是你原来的女朋友，或许是一些不喜欢你写的旅游书的人，洛茨先生。”

“可你觉得惠斯勒的那个白发男子是怎么回事？”尼克说道，“那个叫梅格·赫特森的女孩儿在咖啡馆里管我叫好莱坞先生，那个人听到了。还有这会儿我在我的 车上收到一封给好莱坞先生的信。这个好莱坞先生究竟 是谁呢？”

“我们都希望找到问题的答案，洛茨先生，”警察说，“可我们不是总能找得到的。”

问题一个接一个。可都没有答案。

尼克从警察局出来，开车回酒店。他又生气又害怕。

“那个白发男子怎么能在温哥华找到我呢？”他想，“他是从惠斯勒跟踪我来到这里的吗？他现在还在跟踪我吗？也许他也住在我住的那家酒店，可能就在隔壁房间里，还带着枪。”

4The man with white hair

The man with white hair

Nick stopped his car in front of the hotel. He looked carefully before he got out, but there was nobody with white hair near the hotel.

He half-ran through the hotel doors and went to the desk inside.

'I'm looking for a man with very short white hair,' he said to the woman behind the desk. 'He's staying here, I think. He's about sixty years old, and he's tall and thin.'

The woman did not look very interested. 'There are a lot of visitors in the hotel,' she said. 'Do you know his name?'

'No, I don't,' Nick said. 'He's, er, a friend of a friend, you see. He arrived in Vancouver yesterday, and I must find him. It's very important. Please help me!'

The woman looked at him. 'There are three hundred and fifty rooms in this hotel,' she said, 'and maybe thirty or forty men with white hair. How can I remember all their names?' She turned away to answer a telephone call.

Nick walked away from the desk.

'A drink,' he thought. 'I need a drink.' He went into the hotel bar, got a drink and sat down at a table.

'So what do I do now?' he thought.

And then he remembered something. A letter in the girl's half-open bag in the Whistler café.

... and we can meet at the Empress Hotel, Victoria, Vancouver Island, on Friday afternoon ...

And tomorrow was Friday.

'I'm going to Victoria, on Vancouver Island!' he thought. 'To the Empress Hotel!'

*　　*　　*

Nick had dinner in the hotel that evening. He finished eating and got up from his table... and saw the man with white hair .

Nick moved quickly. The man was at the hotel desk. Nick could see the white head above the other heads near the desk.

'Excuse me!' said Nick. He pushed past the people in the hotel restaurant. A small boy ran in front of him and Nick ran into him. The boy and Nick fell down on the floor. The boy began to cry.

'Hey!' said a woman behind Nick.

'I'm very sorry!' said Nick. He got up and helped the boy to his feet. 'Are you OK?' he asked the boy.

'Be more careful next time,' said the woman.

Nick moved away quickly, but when he looked back at the hotel desk, he couldn't see the man with white hair. He pushed through the crowd of people.

'That man!' he shouted at the woman behind the desk. 'That man with short white hair. Where did he go?'

The woman looked at Nick. 'Mr Vickers?' she said. 'I don't know.'

'Vickers? Is that his name?' said Nick. 'What's his room number?'

'I'm sorry, I can't tell you that,' the woman said.

'But I need to—' began Nick.

The woman turned away to answer the telephone.

After a second or two, Nick went upstairs to his room.

'Vickers,' he thought. 'Does Meg Hutson know Mr Vickers? I need some answers, and I need them quickly!'

4．白发男子

尼克在酒店前停了车。下车前他仔细观察了一番，可酒店附近没有什么白发男子。

他小跑着穿过了酒店的大门，来到里边的前台。

“我找一个留着白色短发的人，”他对前台里面的女人说，“我想他住在这里。他大约60岁上下，又高又瘦。”

那个女的看起来并不十分在意。“酒店里有很多客人，”她说，“你知道他的名字吗？”

“不，不知道，”尼克答道，“他是，呃，是一个朋友的朋友，你明白吧。他昨天到的温哥华，我必须找到他。这很重要。拜托请帮帮忙！”

女人看着尼克。“酒店里有350个房间，”她说，“或许有三四十个男人都留着白发。我怎么能记得住他们所有人的名字？”她转过身去接电话了。

尼克离开了前台。

“喝一杯，”他想，“我需要喝一杯。”他走进酒店里的酒吧，要了杯酒，坐了下来。

“那我现在做些什么？”他思索着。

于是他回忆起了什么，就是在惠斯勒的那家咖啡馆，那个女孩儿半开的包里的一封信。

“……我们可于星期五下午在温哥华岛维多利亚的皇后酒店见面……”

明天就是星期五。

“我得去温哥华岛的维多利亚！”他想，“去皇后酒店！”

*　　*　　*

那天晚上尼克在酒店吃晚餐。吃完饭后他从餐桌旁站起身来……看到了那个白发男子 。

尼克赶紧走了过去。那个男人站在酒店的前台旁边。尼克能看到那个高出人丛的白色脑袋。

“对不起，请让一下！”尼克说道。他推开酒店餐厅里的人群。一个小男孩儿挡住了他的去路，尼克撞到了他。男孩儿和尼克都摔倒在地上。男孩儿哭了起来。

“嗨！”尼克身后的一个女人喊道。

“非常抱歉！”尼克说道。他站起来，把那个小男孩儿也扶了起来。“你没事吧？”他问男孩儿。

“下回小心点儿。”女人说道。

尼克赶紧走开，可当他回过头往前台那边看时，那个白发男子却不见了。他冲出了人群。

“就是那个男的！”他朝前台的那个女人喊道，“那个留着白色短发的男人。他去哪儿了？”

女人看了尼克一眼。“维克斯先生？”她说道，“我不知道。”

“维克斯？他叫维克斯吗？”尼克问道，“他住在哪个房间？”

“对不起，这个我不能告诉你。”女人说道。

“但是我需要——”尼克恳求道。

女人转过身去接电话了。

不一会儿，尼克回到了他楼上的房间。

“维克斯，”他想，“梅格·赫特森认识维克斯先生吗？我得找到答案，马上找到！”

5Vancouver Island

Vancouver Island

Tsawwassen was about twenty-three miles south of Vancouver. Nick drove there in his car the next morning for the one o'clock ferry to Vancouver Island. Every five minutes, he looked behind him. The road was busy—black cars, white cars, red cars, green cars. Maybe Vickers was in one of them.

At Tsawwassen Nick drove his car on to the ferry. There were a lot of cars and crowds of people. Nick got out of his car and walked up and down the ship. He looked for a man with white hair but he didn't see one.

Soon the ferry began to move and Nick felt better. He found the ferry restaurant and got something to eat. More people came in. Nick looked at the faces of all the older men. Some had hats on, so he looked for somebody tall and thin, but there was nobody.

'Maybe he's not on the ferry,' Nick thought. 'Maybe he's back in Vancouver.'

Later, Nick walked around the ship again. Once, he thought he saw the man with white hair in the crowds, but he could not be sure.

Ninety minutes after leaving Tsawwassen, the ferry arrived at Swartz Bay on Vancouver Island, and Nick went back down to his car.

Swartz Bay was twenty miles north of Victoria. Nick drove quickly, and again, looked behind him every four or five minutes. Once, he saw a red car about two hundred yards behind him.

'Did I see that car on the road from Vancouver to Tsawwassen?' he thought.

He drove more slowly, but the red car still stayed two hundred yards behind him, and Nick couldn't see the driver's face or hair.

Soon he was in the busy streets of Victoria, and Nick didn't see the red car behind him again.

Victoria was a city of gardens and beautiful old buildings. Nick liked Victoria very much, but today he wasn't interested in gardens or buildings.

He found the Empress Hotel, went inside and walked across to the desk.

'Can I help you?' a young man asked Nick.

'I'm meeting a friend here this afternoon,' said Nick. 'Miss Hutson.'

'Hutson?' said the young man. 'Wait a minute.' He went away and came back. 'Sorry, but there's no Miss Hutson staying here.'

Nick took something from his pocket. It was the photograph of Meg and her father, from the magazine. 'This is her,' he said.

The young man looked at the picture. 'Oh, right. You mean Howard Hutson's daughter,' he said. 'She's not staying here, but I saw her ten or fifteen minutes ago. She was with somebody—a man. He asked me about the tea room.'

'The tea room?' said Nick. 'Where's that?'

*　　*　　*

The man with short white hair was tired. He couldn't sleep and he couldn't eat. He thought about only one thing, all the time. He drove and he watched, and he waited and he followed.

When he drove into Victoria, the streets were busy, and suddenly he lost the blue car in front of him. Angrily, he drove around the city, past all the big hotels. 'I must find him,' he said. 'I must do it. Today.'

Then he saw the Empress Hotel, and in the street outside it, a blue car.

He drove past the hotel, left his car, and ran back down the street. He went across the road and walked past the downstairs windows. There was a big room with tables and chairs, and a lot of people. He looked carefully at all the faces.

'There she is!' he said suddenly.

There were two men with the girl. He couldn't see their faces, only the backs of their heads, but one of the men was in a green shirt.

'Mr Hollywood,' the man said, and smiled. 'Goodbye, Mr Hollywood.' People in the street turned to look at him, but the man did not see them.

He walked up to the doors of the hotel and put a hand into his pocket. Inside, the gun was cold and hard.

5．温哥华岛

吐瓦森在温哥华以南大约23英里处。尼克第二天上午开车赶往那里，为的是赶下午1点的渡轮去温哥华岛。他每隔5分钟就往后看看。公路上很繁忙——黑色的车，白色的车，红色的，还有绿色的。或许维克斯就在其中的一辆车里。

尼克把车开上了吐瓦森的渡轮。那里停了很多车，人群也熙熙攘攘的。尼克从车里出来，在船上四处转了转。他想看看有没有留着白头发的人，可是没有看到。

渡轮很快就开动了，尼克也感觉好点儿了。他找到了渡轮上的餐厅，要了些东西吃。随后，更多的人来到了餐厅。尼克打量着每一个上岁数的人的脸。有人还戴着帽子，于是他就找又高又瘦的人，但还是什么也没发现。

“也许他没在这艘渡轮上，”尼克想，“也许他回温哥华去了。”

过了一会儿，尼克又在船上走了一圈。他一度觉得好像在人群中看到了那个白发男子，可他也说不准。

渡轮离开吐瓦森90分钟后就到达了温哥华岛的斯瓦茨湾，尼克回到了他的车上。

斯瓦茨湾位于维多利亚北面20英里处。尼克把车开得飞快，仍旧每隔四五分钟就回头看看。有一次，他看到在他后面大约200码远的地方有一辆红色的车。

“从温哥华去吐瓦森的路上我看到那辆车了吗？”他想道。

他放慢了车速，可那辆红色的车始终在他后面200码开外，而尼克又看不见司机的脸和头发。

尼克很快就来到了维多利亚繁华的街道上，也就又看不到后面那辆红色的车了。

维多利亚是个美丽的城市，有很多花园和漂亮的古建筑。尼克很喜欢这里，可是今天他对花园和建筑都没有兴趣。

他找到了皇后酒店，进去径直走到前台。

“我能为你做些什么吗？”一个年轻人问尼克。

“我今天下午要在这儿见一个朋友，”尼克说道，“赫特森小姐。”

“赫特森？”年轻人说，“等一下。”他走开了一会儿又回来了，“对不起，赫特森小姐不住在这里。”

尼克从口袋里掏出了什么东西。是梅格和他父亲的照片，从那本杂志上剪下来的。“这就是赫特森小姐。”他说。

年轻人看了看照片。“哦，是的。你是说霍华德·赫特森的女儿，”他说，“她不住在这儿，可我10到15分钟之前看到她了。她跟一个人在一起——一个男的。他向我打听茶座在哪里。”

“茶座？”尼克问，“茶座在哪里？”

*　　*　　*

那个留着白色短发的男人已经很疲倦了。他吃不好，睡不好，一直都只想着一件事。他要么开车赶路，要么盯梢观察，要么等待，要么跟踪。

当他开车到了维多利亚时，街上非常繁忙，他突然找不到前面那辆蓝色的车了。他气急败坏地开着车转遍了整个城市，看过了所有的大酒店。“我必须找到他，”他说，“我必须找到他。就在今天。”

后来他发现了皇后酒店，在酒店门口的街边停着一辆蓝色的车。

他开车从酒店门口经过，下了车，又往回跑到了街上。他穿过马路从楼下的窗前走过。那儿有一间大屋子，里面摆着桌椅，还有很多人。他仔细地观察着每张面孔。

“她在那儿！”他突然叫道。

女孩儿和两个男人在一起。他看不到男人的脸，只能看到他们的后脑勺，但其中一个男的穿着绿色的衬衣。

“好莱坞先生，”白发男人说道，脸上带着微笑，“别了，好莱坞先生。”街上的行人转过身来看着他，可白发男人根本没理会他们。

他上了楼，来到酒店门口，一只手伸进了口袋。口袋里面是一支冰冷、坚硬的枪。

6A tea party

A tea party

Nick looked through the doors of the tea room in the Empress Hotel.

Meg Hutson sat at a table with a man. The man was about thirty, or maybe a year or two younger. He was tall, and brown from the sun. He wore a white shirt, white trousers, and white shoes. He said something to Meg, and she laughed. She looked very happy.

A waiter came up to Nick. 'Can I get you some tea?' he asked.

'No, thanks,' said Nick. 'I'm with the two people over there.' And he walked across to Meg's table.

'Hello, Mystery Girl,' said Nick. 'Remember me? We met at Whistler. Your name was Jan then. But maybe today it's Meg Hutson.'

Meg Hutson looked up at him. 'Oh,' she said, and her face went red.

'Who is this, Meg?' asked the man.

'This is Nick,' said Meg. 'He's a writer. Nick, this is Craig Winters.'

'Sometimes called Mr Hollywood?' said Nick.

'Maybe. But how did you know that?' asked Craig Winters.

'I guessed,' said Nick. 'And I think I'm beginning to understand. Can I ask you a question, Mr Winters? Does somebody want to kill you?'

Craig Winters' face went white. 'Kill me?'

'What are you talking about?' asked Meg.

'Before I tell you, answer this question, please,' said Nick. 'You called me Mr Hollywood in Whistler. And you wanted the man at the next table, the man with white hair, to hear you. Is that right?'

Meg Hutson did not answer at first. Then she said quietly, 'Yes.'

'Why?' asked Nick.

'I wanted him to follow you, and not me.'

'Why?' Nick asked again.

'I think he's a detective,' said Meg. 'And I think he's working for my father. I saw him soon after I left Toronto. He followed me.' Meg put her hand on Craig Winters' arm.

'My father doesn't like Craig. A month ago, he told me not to see Craig again. I'm not happy, and he knows that. I think he guessed that I'm meeting Craig. And now he wants to find Craig and stop him seeing me.'

'Stop him?' said Nick. 'Or kill him?'

'No!' Meg Hutson said. 'Daddy doesn't—'

'The man with white hair pushed me in front of a car in Vancouver,' Nick told her. 'And he shot at me in Stanley Park.'

'What!' said Meg.

'Tell—tell me about this man with white hair,' Winters said suddenly.

Nick looked at him. 'He's about sixty, and he's tall and thin,' he said.

'Do you know his name?' asked Winters.

'Vickers,' said Nick.

Craig Winters suddenly looked ill. 'Did he—did he follow you to Victoria? Did he follow you here?'

'I don't know,' said Nick. He watched Winters. 'You're afraid of him. Why? Why does this man Vickers want to kill you, Winters?'

Before Craig Winters could answer, Meg's face went white. 'Oh, no!' she said. 'Look! Look over there, by the door!'

Nick and Craig Winters turned to look. At the door of the tea room stood the man with white hair. He looked up and down the room, and then he saw them, and began to walk across to their table. His hand was in his pocket.

For a second or two the three people at the table did not move. Then Craig Winters jumped to his feet. 'That's Mr Hollywood!' he screamed. 'That man there!' And he pointed at Nick.

The man's hand came out of his pocket—with a gun. 'This is for Anna!' he shouted.

Nick moved very fast. The tea table went over, and Nick was down on the floor in a second. The shot went over his head, and Meg screamed. At the same time Craig Winters shouted out and put a hand on his arm. There was blood on his white shirt. Then more people began to scream, and two waiters pulled the man with white hair down on to the floor.

'Get the police!' somebody shouted.

6．茶会

尼克从皇后酒店茶座的门口往里看去。

梅格·赫特森和一个男人坐在桌子旁。那个男人有30来岁，或者还要年轻一两岁，个子很高，脸被太阳晒成了棕色。他穿着白衬衣，白裤子和一双白鞋子。他对梅格说了些什么，她笑了。她看起来非常高兴。

一位服务员走到尼克跟前。“来些茶吗？”他问道。

“不了，谢谢，”尼克说，“我是跟那边那两个人一起的。”接着他便朝梅格的桌子走去。

“你好，神秘女孩儿，”尼克向她打招呼，“还记得我吗？我们在惠斯勒见过。你那时候叫简，可今天也许叫梅格·赫特森吧。”

梅格·赫特森抬头看着他。“哦。”她开口道，脸色变红了。

“这位是谁，梅格？”那个男的问道。

“这是尼克，”梅格说道，“是位作家。尼克，这是克雷格·温特斯。”

“有时也叫好莱坞先生，是不是？”尼克说。

“也许是。可你 是怎么知道的？”克雷格·温特斯问道。

“我猜的，”尼克答道，“我想我开始明白了。能问你一个问题吗，温特斯先生？是不是有人要杀你？”

克雷格·温特斯的脸色变得惨白。“有人要杀我？”

“你在说什么呀？”梅格问道。

“在我告诉你之前，请先回答这个问题，好吗？”尼克说道，“你在惠斯勒时叫我 好莱坞先生，是想让临桌那个男人，那个白头发的男人听到。我说得对吧？”

梅格·赫特森没有马上回答。过了一会儿她平静地答道：“是的。”

“为什么要那样？”尼克问道。

“我想让那个人去跟踪你，而不是我。”

“为什么要那样？”尼克又问了一遍。

“我觉得他是一个侦探，”梅格说，“我还觉得是我父亲雇了他跟踪我。我离开多伦多不久就看到了他。他跟踪我。”梅格挽住了克雷格·温特斯的胳膊。

“我父亲不喜欢克雷格，一个月前，他告诉我不许再见克雷格。我很难过，他也知道这个。我想他猜到了我要去见克雷格，所以现在他就要找到克雷格，阻止他和我见面。”

“阻止克雷格吗？”尼克问道，“还是要杀掉他？”

“不会的！”梅格·赫特森说道，“爸爸不会——”

“在温哥华，那个白发男人把我往汽车前面推，”尼克告诉她说，“在斯坦利公园他还开枪打我。”

“什么！”梅格叫道。

“跟——跟我说说那个白发男人的情况。”温特斯突然说道。

尼克看着他。“他大约60来岁，又高又瘦。”尼克说道。

“你知道他的名字吗？”温特斯问道。

“维克斯。”尼克答道。

克雷格·温特斯的脸色突然变了。“他是——是不是跟踪你到了维多利亚？他跟着你来这儿了吗？”

“我不知道。”尼克说。他看着温特斯。“你害怕他。为什么？为什么维克斯要杀你，温特斯？”

温特斯还没有开口回答，梅格的脸色一下子就变白了。“哦，不！”她叫道，“看！往那边看，门那边！”

尼克和克雷格·温特斯转过头看去。那个白发男子就站在茶座门口。他往屋里四处搜寻着，看见他们后，便朝他们坐着的桌子走来。他的手还插在口袋里。

桌旁的三个人惊呆了一两秒钟。接着克雷格·温特斯跳了起来。“那个人是好莱坞先生！”他惊叫道，“就是那边的那个人！”他手指着尼克。

白发男人从口袋里抽出手来——握着一枝枪。“这是为安娜报仇的！”他大叫道。

尼克急忙躲开。茶桌被掀翻了，尼克赶紧趴到了地上。子弹从他头顶飞过，梅格尖叫了起来。就在这时，克雷格·温特斯大叫一声，用手捂住了胳膊。白色的衬衣上渗出了鲜红的血。更多的人尖叫起来，两个服务员过来把白发男子按在了地上。

“快去报警！”有人喊道。

7At the police station

At the police station

It was 7.30 p.m. Nick and Meg were in a room at the police station. The man called Vickers was in a different room, with three detectives. There was a doctor with him too. Craig Winters was at the hospital.

The door opened and a detective came in with two cups of coffee. He put them down on the table, and turned to go out again.

'Detective Edmonds,' Meg said, 'did the hospital call? Is Craig going to be all right?'

'Winters?' Detective Edmonds said. 'Yes, he's going to be OK.'

'Can I call the hospital now?' asked Meg.

'I'd like you to wait,' said Edmonds. 'Detective Keat is going to be here in a minute. He's just coming from the airport and—' He looked through the open door. 'Ah, here he is now.'

A second detective came into the room, and behind him was a tall man with dark hair.

Meg stood up quickly. 'Daddy!' she cried. 'What are you doing here?'

'The police called me,' said Howard Hutson, 'and I flew here at once. Detective Keat met me at the airport. Now, sit down, Meg. I want you to listen to me.' He did not look at Nick.

Meg sat down and her father took her hands. 'Meg, last week Johnnie Vickers came to my house. He wanted to talk about his daughter. You remember Anna, Meg? Three months ago she jumped off a bridge in Boston and died. She was young, beautiful, rich—and she didn't want to live. Why? Because she loved a man, and the man took her money, ran away and left her. And the man was called—'

'No!' said Meg. 'NO!'

'Yes, Meg, yes. He was called Mr Hollywood.'

'No!' shouted Meg. She began to cry.

'That's right, Miss Hutson,' said detective Keat quietly. 'To you, he gave the name Craig Winters. When Anna Vickers knew him, he was Carl Windser. But he liked all his... er... girlfriends to call him Mr Hollywood. He took nearly 50,000 dollars from Anna Vickers. And there was a girl before that... '

'No, it's not true!' Meg shouted.

'It is true, Meg,' said her father. 'Winters—Windser—gets all his money from rich men's daughters. Johnnie Vickers loved his daughter. He went to her house in Boston after she died. He read her letters, and learned about the money and the name Mr Hollywood. And when he came to my house, I told him about you, Meg. I said, "My daughter's got a new boyfriend, and she calls him Mr Hollywood. I don't like him, but I can't stop her. She's going away to meet him next week, I think. What can I do?" Johnnie put his hand on my arm, and he said, "Don't be afraid for your daughter. I'm going to find that man—and stop him!"'

Meg said nothing. Her face was very white. For a minute or two nobody spoke, then detective Edmonds said:

'Vickers told us all about it, Miss Hutson. He followed you to Whistler, and saw you with—'

Nick began to understand. 'With me, in the café! And Meg called me Mr Hollywood!'

Howard Hutson looked at Nick. 'You're the travel writer guy, right?'

'Lortz. Nick Lortz,' said Nick. 'Vickers nearly killed me. He shot at me twice, and—'

But Howard Hutson was not very interested in Nick. He looked at his daughter again.

'How much money did you give him, Meg?' he said.

'I—I gave him 25,000 dollars,' said Meg. 'Only for two or three months, he said. Then he...' She began to cry again.

'Well, you can say goodbye to that money,' said Hutson angrily.

'What's going to happen to Vickers?' Nick asked detective Edmonds.

'Hospital, I think,' said Edmonds. 'OK, he shot at you and about fifty people saw him. But he's not a well man. The doctors are going to put him away in a hospital.'

Howard Hutson stood up. 'OK, Meg, I'm going to take you home. My plane is waiting at the airport.'

Meg followed her father to the door, then she remembered Nick and turned.

'I'm sorry,' she said. 'I got you into all this. I called you Mr Hollywood. That was wrong. But I didn't know——'

'It's OK,' said Nick. 'You know everything now. And it's better to learn it now, and not later. 50, 000 dollars later.'

7．在警察局

已经是晚上7:30了。尼克和梅格坐在警察局的一间屋子里。那个名叫维克斯的男子和三名侦探在另一间屋子里，跟他在一起的还有一名医生。克雷格·温特斯那时已经在医院了。

门开了，一名侦探端着两杯咖啡走了进来。他把咖啡放在桌子上，又转身出去了。

“埃德蒙兹侦探，”梅格问道，“医院来电话了吗？克雷格不会有事吧？”

“温特斯吗？”埃德蒙兹侦探说，“是的，他会没事的。”

“我现在可以给医院打电话吗？”梅格问道。

“我希望你能再等一等，”埃德蒙兹说，“基特侦探马上就来。他正从机场回来，还有——”他透过开着的门往外看去，“啊，他来了。”

又一位侦探来到了屋里，后面跟着一个高个子的黑发男人。

梅格马上站了起来。“爸爸！”她叫了出来，“你来这里干什么？”

“警方传唤我，”霍华德·赫特森说道，“我就马上乘飞机来了。基特侦探去机场接我。好了，梅格，坐下。你听我说。”他没有理会尼克。

梅格坐下来，父亲握住了她的手。“梅格，上个星期约翰尼·维克斯去了我那里，他是想跟我谈谈他的女儿。梅格，你还记得安娜吗？三个月前，她从波士顿的一座桥上跳了下去，摔死了。她还很年轻，又很漂亮、富有——可她就是不想活了。为什么？因为她爱一个人，而那个人却骗走了她的钱，离她而去。那个男的叫——”

“不会的！”梅格说道，“不会的 ！”

“是的，梅格，是的。他叫好莱坞先生。”

“不会的！”梅格喊道。她哭了起来。

“这是事实，赫特森小姐，”基特侦探语气平静地说道，“他跟你说他叫克雷格·温特斯。安娜认识他的时候，他又叫卡尔·温莎。可他喜欢他的……呃……他所有的女朋友叫他好莱坞先生。他从安娜·维克斯那里骗走了50,000块钱。这之前还有另外一个女孩……”

“不，这不是真的！”梅格大声叫道。

“这是 真的，梅格，”父亲说道，“温特斯——温莎——所有的钱都是从富家小姐的手里骗来的。约翰尼·维克斯很爱他的女儿。她死后，他去了她在波士顿的住处。他看了她的信，知道了钱的事和好莱坞先生这个名字。他来到我那里后我把你的事告诉了他，梅格。我说：‘我女儿新交了一个男朋友，她叫他好莱坞先生。我不喜欢他，可我阻拦不了她。我想她下周要去见他。我该怎么办？’约翰尼把手放在我的胳膊上说：‘不要担心你的女儿。我会找到那个人——并且阻止他的！’”

梅格沉默不语。她脸色惨白。一时间大家都沉默了，于是埃德蒙兹侦探开口道：

“维克斯跟我们说了这一切，赫特森小姐。他跟踪你到了惠斯勒，看到你和——”

尼克开始明白过来了。“和我在一起，在咖啡馆里！梅格还叫我好莱坞先生！”

霍华德·赫特森看着尼克。“你就是那位旅行作家，是不是？”

“洛茨。尼克·洛茨，”尼克说道，“维克斯差点儿杀了我。他两次开枪打我，还——”

可霍华德·赫特森对尼克并不感兴趣。他又转过头去看着自己的女儿。

“你给了他多少钱，梅格？”他问道。

“我——我给了他25,000块，”梅格说道，“他说他只借用两三个月。然后他……”梅格又哭了起来。

“好了，你可以跟那些钱说再见了。”赫特森生气地说道。

“维克斯会怎么样？”尼克问埃德蒙兹侦探。

“我想他会住在医院里。”埃德蒙兹回答，“对了，他朝你开枪，大约有50个人看到了。可他身体不好，医生会安排他住院的。”

霍华德·赫特森站起身来。“好了，梅格，我要带你回家。我的飞机在机场等着呢。”

梅格跟着父亲走到门口时想起了尼克，她转过身来。

“对不起，”她说道，“都是我给你惹来的麻烦。我不该叫你好莱坞先生，可我不知道——”

“没事了，”尼克说道，“你现在都知道了。现在知道会好一些，还不晚。总比等到丢了50,000块钱的时候要好。”

8A nice smile

A nice smile

Nick took the evening ferry back to Vancouver. He was tired and hungry, so he went down to get some dinner in the ferry restaurant.

The restaurant was busy and there was only one free table. Nick sat down quickly and began to eat. 'I must get back to work tomorrow,' he thought, 'and forget about millionaires' daughters and men with guns.'

'Excuse me,' somebody said. 'Can I sit with you?'

Nick looked up. There was a pretty girl next to his table. He got up.

'It—it's OK,' he said. 'You can have this table. I don't want it.' And he began to move away.

'Please don't go,' the girl said. 'Stay and finish your dinner.' She smiled at him. It was a nice smile.

But Nick knew all about nice smiles.

'I'm not hungry,' he said.

And he walked quickly out of the restaurant.

8．甜蜜的微笑

尼克乘当晚的渡轮回温哥华。他又累又饿，于是去渡轮的餐厅吃晚餐。

餐厅里人很多，只有一张餐桌空着。尼克马上坐下，吃起东西来。“我明天必须重新开始工作了，”他想，“别去想什么百万富翁的女儿还有带枪的男子了。”

“对不起，”有人说话，“可以坐在你这儿吗？”

尼克抬起头。餐桌旁边站着一个漂亮的女孩儿。他站起身来。

“可——可以，”他答道，“你可以用这张桌子，我不用了。”他说着就准备离开。

“请不要走呀，”女孩儿说，“在这儿吃完你的晚餐呀。”她冲她微笑着。一个很甜蜜的微笑。

可尼克对甜蜜的微笑太了解了。

“我不饿了。”他说道。

接着他便迅速离开了餐厅。

THE BRIDGEand Other Love Stories


and Other Love Stories

Love can always find a way, people say. But the road to love is often difficult. People say the wrong thing, do the wrong thing, can't find the right words, make mistakes, misunderstand each other...

In the first story Luke and Gemma talk about a plan for love. But who makes the plan? And who is the plan for? What kind of plan? You can make a plan for a holiday or a train journey or a piece of work, but can you really make a plan for love?

In the second story Sam plans a big surprise at the Sunflower Café for his girlfriend Lucy. Sam makes wonderful cakes, and the surprise is a nice idea. But what does Lucy think about it?

In the last story Alma returns to her home town after six years away. It is a sad time for her, because she cannot forget the story of Nina and Dragan. Nina was Alma's sister, and Nina was in love with a young man called Dragan...





Plan for Love


Gemma was hungry. Time for lunch, she thought. She went down to the hospital canteen, got some sandwiches and a cup of coffee, and looked for a table. But it was one o'clock and the canteen was very busy. There were no free tables. Then, at the long table by the window, she saw a tall man with fair hair. It was her friend Luke, and there was a seat next to him. She walked across to him.

'Hi Luke. Can I sit here?' said Gemma.

Luke did not look up, and did not speak. Perhaps he didn't hear her.

Gemma tried again. 'Luke? Er, can I sit here? Or are you waiting for someone?'

'Oh, hi Gemma. No, no, I'm not waiting for anyone. Come and sit down.'

Gemma put her sandwiches and coffee on the table, and sat down. She and Luke worked in the physiotherapy clinic in a hospital in Bristol. Usually, Luke was friendly, but not today.

'The canteen's very busy,' Gemma said. 'Where did all these people come from?'

Luke did not answer.

'Luke? Are you OK? Is something wrong?'

'I'm OK. I'm good,' said Luke. He moved his coffee cup around on the table, and did not look at Gemma. He drank some coffee. Gemma began to eat her sandwiches.

Then Luke put his cup down, and looked at Gemma. 'Gemma, we're good friends, aren't we? Can I talk to you?'

Gemma put her sandwich down. 'Yes, of course, Luke. What is it?'

Luke's face was red. 'It's stupid of me, I know that. But I... I mean... Look, do you see that girl over there? The girl with the long blonde hair?'

'Do you see that girl over there?' said Luke.

Gemma looked across the canteen. There was a beautiful girl with long blonde hair at a table near the door. Gemma's hair was short and black, and she wore glasses.

'You mean Charlotte? She works for Dr Howell, doesn't she?'

'That's right. Well, I really like her. She's... well, look at her, she's beautiful! I want to talk to her, I really do!'

'So talk to her!'

'But I can never find the right words. What can I say? I open my mouth – and nothing comes out! And she goes away, and I feel stupid.'

Gemma smiled at him.

'Poor Luke! But that's not like you. When you're with me, you talk about lots of things. Like this weekend – what did you do this weekend?'

'I went swimming with Paul on Saturday,' Luke said. 'We went in the sea. It was so cold – but it was great!'

They talked for a few minutes. Then Gemma said:

'Luke, you're on the social committee, aren't you?'

'Yes, that's right,' said Luke. 'Why?'

'Well, I've got a plan. We make you a list of questions – about music, and free time, nights out – things like that. Then you ask Charlotte these questions. You're asking them for the social committee, you see. And she answers – and you ask some more questions, and there you are... you're talking to Charlotte!'

'Hmm,' said Luke. 'Yes, I see – I think!'

'I know,' said Gemma, 'let's try the plan now. You're Charlotte, and I'm Luke. I do the questions, and you do the answers – OK?'

'Er, yes,' said Luke. 'You mean, I must ask you all these questions now?'

'Er, no,' said Gemma. 'It's like... well, we're playing... I'm playing Luke, and you're playing Charlotte. For now, you ARE Charlotte, OK?'

'Right. Got it,' said Luke. 'So you're me. You're Luke.'

Gemma smiled again. 'Good. OK, let's go.' She spoke in a different voice. 'Hi Charlotte. My name's Luke, and I'm on the social committee. We want to plan some days and nights out for people from the hospital. What do you like doing? Is it OK to ask you some questions?'

'Yes, of course,' said Luke.

'OK – first, what kind of music do you like?'

'That's easy. I like Black Phoenix, and the Tree Rats – do you know the Tree Rats? They're really good.'

'No, I don't,' said Gemma, 'but I saw Black Phoenix last month. They're great! OK – what do you like doing at the weekend?'

'I like running, and swimming,' said Luke. 'And I like going out on my bike...'

'You see?' said Gemma. 'It's easy really. You just need the questions.'

'You just need the questions,' said Gemma.

Later that afternoon, Luke stopped in the office. Gemma was at one of the computers.

'Hi, Luke,' said Gemma. 'Have you got a few minutes? I've got some questions here. Come and see.'

Luke read the list of questions on her computer.

'Oh, that's great, Gemma!' he said.

'Do you want to put any more questions on the list?' she asked. Luke thought for a minute.

'Do you like going to music festivals?' he said at last.

'Yes, that's good,' said Gemma. She put it on the list.

Soon Luke had the list in his hands.

'Wait for the right time,' said Gemma. 'And – good luck!'

Every day Luke looked for Charlotte in the canteen. On Tuesday she was with Molly, and on Wednesday he did not see her. But on Thursday...

'Hi Charlotte,' said Luke. 'My name's Luke. I'm on the social committee. We want to plan some days and nights out for people from the hospital. Can I ask you some questions?'

'OK,' said Charlotte, and she smiled at Luke.

They sat down near the window.

'Right,' said Luke. 'First, what kind of music do you like?'

'Well, I like the Good Girls, and Sadie Moonlight, and lots of girl singers, really. Oh, and Bobbie, of course.'

'Bobbie?' said Luke. 'Really?'

'He's wonderful . "Love me, love nobody but me,"' sang Charlotte happily.

'Do you like Black Phoenix?'

'Who?' said Charlotte.

'Um – it doesn't matter,' said Luke quickly. 'Let's see-do you like swimming?'

'Swimming?' laughed Charlotte. 'Just look at my hair. Me – swimming!'

'Swimming?' laughed Charlotte. 'Just look at my hair.'

'Have you got a bike?'

'No – I rode a bike when I was little, but not now. Not in these shoes.' Luke looked at Charlotte's shoes. They had very high heels.

'Do you go to festivals?'

'Only in good weather, with no rain and no tents.'

'So – you never go to festivals,' Luke said.

'Never,' said Charlotte.

'What do you like doing in your free time then?'

'Facebook,' Charlotte said. 'I'm on Facebook every night. Are you on Facebook?'

'Er, no,' said Luke. 'I, er, use computers at work, but away from work I like to do other things. I go—'

But Charlotte was not interested in listening to Luke. 'But why not?' she said. 'Facebook is soooo cool! Do you know, I've got 778 Facebook friends, lots of them are in America, and I've got some in Japan, Australia – oh, everywhere! And photos – I've got thousands of photos on Facebook now.'

'You don't go out much, then?' Luke asked. 'You just go on Facebook?'

'Of course not!' said Charlotte. 'Don't be stupid. I hang out with my friends – Monica, Jess, Ellie, Alice... We go to clubs, and we go shopping. I love shopping. We're going to Eastwater next weekend, me and Jess and Alice. Do you know, there are more than 250 shops there. We're going into every one of them! I can't wait!' She saw Luke's face, and laughed. 'Oh, men are sooo boring about shopping!'

‘I love shopping. We're going to Eastwater next weekend...’

'Well, I, er...' Luke said. He began again, '250 shops – Wow! That's a lot of shopping. Well, have a great day with your friends, Charlotte. Thanks for your time. Nice talking to you.'

'That's OK, Luke,' said Charlotte. 'Bye.'

Gemma looked up. Luke was at the door, and in his hand was the list of questions.

'Hmm,' she said. 'That's not a happy face. Three out of ten? Two out of ten?'

'Zero out of ten, I think,' said Luke unhappily. 'She doesn't like swimming, bikes, or festivals, and she doesn't like Black Phoenix – she likes Bobbie!'

'Bobbie!' said Gemma. She laughed. 'Oh no!'

'Yes. And she likes the Good Girls. And she loves shopping, and can't wait to go to Eastwater.'

'Bad luck, Luke,' said Gemma. 'You got all the answers, but they're all the wrong answers. You and Charlotte are very different people.'

'Very different,' said Luke unhappily. 'You're right.'

He walked away, and Gemma watched him. 'Oh, Luke!' she thought.

On Sunday morning Luke went out on his bike. He rode along the streets of the city and thought about his week.

'I'm stupid,' he thought. 'Charlotte is the wrong girl for me. She's beautiful, but we like different things.'

Suddenly he saw a lot of people by the road. He stopped to look. 'What's going on?' he thought. 'Why are all those people clapping and shouting?' He began to cross the street, but a policeman came over to him.

'You can't go along there,' he said. 'The race is finishing there.'

'The race?' said Luke. 'What race is that?'

'It's the City Road Race,' said the policeman. 'Look – here come the runners now.'

The first man finished the race, and Luke clapped. A few minutes later, the women runners arrived. Luke clapped them too. Then he looked again. Was that Gemma? Yes it was – and she was third!

'Gemma,' Luke called. 'Well done, Gemma!' He put his bike against a tree and ran across to Gemma.

'Hello, Luke,' said Gemma. She was in her running clothes, black and green, and she looked good.

Gemma was in her running clothes, and she looked good.

'Wow,' Luke said. 'You look great in those colours. I only ever see you in hospital clothes usually. And you came third too. That's wonderful!'

Gemma was busy with her towel. 'Thanks, Luke,' she said.

Luke could not take his eyes away from Gemma. 'You're a runner,' he said. 'I never knew that.'

'You never asked me,' said Gemma. She smiled at Luke, a long slow warm smile.

Luke looked down into her blue eyes. He looked for a long time. A new and wonderful idea came into his head. 'Wow,' he said again. 'I never saw your eyes before – they're... beautiful.'

Gemma laughed. 'I wear glasses at work,' she said. 'That's why.'

Luke Suddenly remembered. 'Hey, you're tired, you just ran a race. Let's sit down.'

They sat down on a low wall together. Around them, other people talked about the race, but Luke and Gemma did not hear them or see them. They sat quietly and Gemma drank some water. Luke wanted to say a lot of things, but he could not find the right words. Then he opened his mouth – and all the right words came out.

'Gemma, have you got a bike?' he asked.

'Yes,' she said. 'Last year I went to Utrecht for a week in the summer, and I went everywhere by bike.'

'Do you like swimming?'

'Yes, and I love swimming in the sea – it's the best.'

'And you like Black Phoenix, and the Tree Rats.'

'And Darkwater,' said Gemma. 'They're like the Tree Rats, but better.'

'Darkwater?' said Luke. 'I like them, they're really great. Hey, they're at the Mountain Club tonight. Would you like to... I mean... Do you... You don't want to come with me, perhaps?'

Gemma laughed, a long happy laugh. 'Of course, I want to!' she said. 'What time shall we go?'

Two things, Luke thought. You only need two things. The right questions – and the right answers. Then it's easy.

爱的计划


杰玛饿了。该吃午饭了，她想。她下楼来到医院的食堂，买了些三明治和一杯咖啡，想找个位子坐下。可现在是一点钟，食堂里人很多，没有空位子。这时候，在靠窗的长桌旁边，她看到一位金发的高个男子。那是她的朋友卢克，他旁边有个空位子。她向他走了过去。

“嗨，卢克。我能坐这儿吗？”杰玛问。

卢克没有抬头，也没有说话。也许他没有听见杰玛的话。

杰玛又说了一遍。“卢克？呃，我能坐在这儿吗？你又或是在等什么人？”

“啊，你好，杰玛。没，没有，我没在等什么人。来坐吧。”

杰玛把三明治和咖啡放在桌上，坐了下来。她和卢克都在布里斯托尔一家医院的理疗诊室工作。平日，卢克待人友好，但今天却是个例外。

“食堂里人真多。”杰玛说，“这些人都是从哪儿来的？”

卢克没有作答。

“卢克？你还好吧？是不是发生什么事了？”

“我没事，挺好的。”卢克说。他拿着咖啡杯在桌上打转，也不看杰玛一眼。他喝了些咖啡。杰玛开始吃她的三明治。

随后卢克把杯子放了下来，看着杰玛。“杰玛，我们是好朋友，对不对？我能和你说点儿事吗？”

杰玛把三明治放下。“对啊，当然可以了，卢克。什么事？”

卢克的脸红了。“我知道我很傻。不过我……我的意思是……看，你看到那边的那个女孩了吗？那个金色长发的女孩？”

杰玛往食堂的另一边望去。在门附近的桌子旁坐着一个金色长发的漂亮女孩。杰玛留着黑色的短发，还戴着眼镜。

“你是说夏洛特？她在豪厄尔医生手下工作，对吧？”

“没错。呃，我真的很喜欢她。她……呃，你看她，她真漂亮！我想和她说话，我真的想啊！”

“那就和她说啊！”

“可我从来没找到过合适的词。我能说什么呢？我张开嘴——什么也说不出来！然后她就走了。我觉得自己是个傻瓜。”

杰玛向他笑了笑。

“可怜的卢克！但那样可不像你啊。你和我在一起的时候，你总有很多话说。就说上个周末吧——你上个周末做什么了？”

“我上周六和保罗去游泳。”卢克说，“我们到海里游泳。水很冷——不过玩得很痛快！”

他们聊了几分钟，然后杰玛说：

“卢克，你是社交委员会的成员，对吧？”

“是啊，没错。”卢克说，“为什么要问这个？”

“嗯，我想到一个计划。我们一起列出一些问题——有关音乐啊，业余时间啊，夜生活啊，等等。然后你去问夏洛特这些问题。要知道，你是代表社交委员会去问的。她回答你——然后你再问更多的问题，然后你不就……你不就和夏洛特说上话了！”

“嗯。”卢克说，“是啊，我懂了——我觉得我懂了！”

“我有个主意。”杰玛说，“我们现在就来试试这个计划。你是夏洛特，我是卢克。我来问问题，你来回答——好吗？”

“呃，好啊。”卢克说，“你的意思是，我现在就要向你问所有的问题吗？”

“呃，不是的。”杰玛说，“这就好像……嗯，好像我们在扮演角色……我扮演卢克，你扮演夏洛特。从现在开始，你就是 夏洛特，明白吗？”

“好的，我明白了。”卢克说，“也就是说你是我。你是卢克。”

杰玛又笑了。“很好。好啦，我们开始吧。”她换了个嗓音。“嗨，夏洛特。我叫卢克，我是社交委员会的委员。我们打算为医院里的人安排一些白天和晚上的社交活动。你 喜欢做什么？我可以问你几个问题吗？”

“当然可以。”卢克说。

“好——首先，你喜欢什么音乐？”

“这简单。我喜欢黑凤凰乐队和棘鼠乐队——你知道棘鼠乐队吗？他们真的很棒。”

“不，我不知道。”杰玛说，“不过我上个月看了黑凤凰的演出。他们很棒！好——你周末喜欢做什么？”

“我喜欢跑步，还有游泳。”卢克说，“我还喜欢骑自行车出门……”

“明白了吗？”杰玛说，“真的很简单。你只要准备好问题就行了。”

那天下午晚些时候，卢克留在办公室里。杰玛坐在其中一台电脑前。

“嗨，卢克。”杰玛说，“你现在有空吗？我列出了一些问题。过来看看吧。”

卢克看了她在电脑上列出的问题。

“啊，真是太棒了，杰玛！”他说。

“你想在单子上再加些问题吗？”她问。卢克想了片刻。

“你喜欢去音乐节吗？”他最终说。

“对，这很好。”杰玛说。她把这个问题加上了。

没过多久，卢克就把单子拿到手了。

“等待合适的时机。”杰玛说，“还有——祝你好运！”

卢克每天都在食堂里寻找夏洛特。星期二，她和莫莉在一起；星期三，他没有看到她。但是，星期四……

“嗨，夏洛特。”卢克说，“我叫卢克。我是社交委员会的。我们打算为医院里的人安排一些白天和晚上的社交活动。我可以问你几个问题吗？”

“好啊。”夏洛特说，她朝卢克笑了笑。

他们在窗户边坐下。

“好。”卢克说，“首先，你喜欢什么音乐？”

“嗯，我喜欢好女孩乐队和萨迪月光乐队，还有很多女歌手，真的很喜欢。哦，当然还有鲍比。”

“鲍比？”卢克说，“真的吗？”

“他真是棒极了 ！‘爱我，只爱我。’”夏洛特开心地唱了起来。

“你喜欢黑凤凰乐队吗？”

“谁？”夏洛特问。

“呃——没关系。”卢克马上说。“看看下一个问题——你喜欢游泳吗？”

“游泳？”夏洛特笑了起来，“看我的头发就知道了。我——游泳！”

“你有自行车吗？”

“没有——我很小的时候骑过，不过现在不骑了。穿这鞋没法骑车。”卢克看了看夏洛特的鞋。这双鞋的鞋跟非常高。

“你去音乐节吗？”

“如果天气好，不下雨，又不支帐篷的话就去。”

“也就是说——你从来不去音乐节。”卢克说。

“从来不去。”夏洛特说。

“那你休息的时候，会 喜欢做什么？”

“‘脸谱’。”夏洛特说，“我每天晚上都上‘脸谱’。你上‘脸谱’吗？”

“呃，没有。”卢克说，“我，呃，工作的时候用电脑，但是下班后我喜欢做点别的事情。我去——”

然而夏洛特对卢克的话不感兴趣。“但是为什么没有呢？”她说，“‘脸谱’简直太酷了！你知道吗，我有778个‘脸谱’好友，很多都在美国，还有的在日本、澳大利亚——啊，在世界各地！还有照片——现在我的‘脸谱’上有几千张照片了。”

“那就是说你不怎么出门了？”卢克问。“你只上‘脸谱’？”

“当然不是了！”夏洛特说，“别犯傻了。我经常和朋友们在一起——莫妮卡、杰丝、埃莉、艾丽斯……我们去俱乐部、逛商场。我爱 购物。我们下周末要去东水购物中心，我、杰丝和艾丽斯。你知道吗，那里有二百五十多家店铺。我们每家都要进去逛！我都等不及了！”她看着卢克的脸，笑了。“啊，谈到购物时，男人真令人扫兴！”

“嗯，我，呃……”卢克说。他停顿了一下又说，“二百五十家店铺——哇！真有的可逛。好吧，祝你和朋友们玩得开心，夏洛特。谢谢你抽出时间回答问题。很高兴和你聊。”

“没什么，卢克。”夏洛特说，“再见。”

杰玛抬起头。卢克站在门口，手里拿着那份问题列表。

“ 。”她说，“你看上去不太高兴啊。十中三？十中二？”

“我想是十中零。”卢克说，声音闷闷不乐，“她不喜欢游泳，不喜欢骑车，也不喜欢音乐节，而且她还不喜欢黑凤凰——她喜欢鲍比！”

“鲍比！”杰玛说。她大笑。“哦，不会吧！”

“是的。她喜欢好女孩乐队，她痴迷购物，还迫不及待地要去东水购物中心。”

“你的运气真背，卢克。”杰玛说，“你的问题都有了答案，不过都是错误答案。你和夏洛特是非常 不同的两个人。”

“非常不同。”卢克难过地说，“你说得对。”

他走开了，杰玛目视着他离开。“唉，卢克！”她心想。

星期天早上，卢克骑着他的自行车出门去。他沿着城市的街道骑行，心里琢磨这个星期发生的事情。

“我真傻。”他想，“夏洛特不适合我。她很美，可我们的喜好不同。”

突然，他看到路边聚集着很多人。他停下来观望。“发生什么事了？”他想，“怎么这些人都在鼓掌呐喊？”他打算过马路，可一位警察走了过来。

“你不能从那里过。”他说，“那里是比赛的终点。”

“比赛？”卢克说，“什么比赛？”

“城市公路赛跑。”警察说，“看——选手们跑过来了。”

第一位男选手跑过了终点，卢克鼓起掌来。几分钟后，女选手们也到了。卢克又为她们鼓掌。他又看了看。那是杰玛吗？是的——而且她还是第三名！

“杰玛。”卢克喊，“好样的，杰玛！”他把自行车靠在树上，向杰玛跑了过去。

“你好啊，卢克。”杰玛说。她穿着一身黑绿相间的跑步服，看上去很漂亮。

“哇，”卢克说，“这种颜色的衣服很适合你。我平时只见过你穿医院的工作服。而且你跑了第三名。太棒了！”

杰玛忙着用毛巾擦汗。“谢谢你，卢克。”她说。

卢克无法把目光从杰玛身上移开。“你是个跑步运动员。”他说，“我从来不知道呢。”

“你从来没问过我。”杰玛说。她对卢克慢慢展开一个悠长而温暖的微笑。

卢克低头看着她蓝色的眼睛。他久久凝望着。他的脑海里出现了一个全新且很棒的念头。“哇，”他又说，“我从没看过你的眼睛——你的眼睛……真美。”

杰玛笑了。“我工作的时候戴眼镜。”她说，“所以你没见过。”

卢克突然想起了什么。“嘿，你累了。你刚刚跑完比赛。我们坐下吧。”

他们一起在一堵矮墙上坐下。在他们周围，其他人在谈论这场比赛，不过卢克和杰玛对旁人不闻不见。他们静静地坐着。杰玛喝了些水。卢克有千言万语，却找不到合适的词。然后他张开嘴——该说的话都说出了口。

“杰玛，你有自行车吗？”他问。

“有啊。”她说，“去年夏天，我去乌得勒支住了一个星期，我去哪儿都骑车。”

“你喜欢游泳吗？”

“喜欢，而且我喜欢在海里游泳——那是最棒的。”

“而且你喜欢黑凤凰乐队和棘鼠乐队。”

“还有暗水乐队。”杰玛说，“他们和棘鼠风格相近，不过要更胜一筹。”

“暗水乐队？”卢克说，“我喜欢他们，他们真的很棒。嘿，他们今晚在大山俱乐部演出。你想不想……我的意思是……你……也许你不想和我一起去吧？”

杰玛笑了，开心地笑了很久。“我当然想了！”她说，“我们什么时候去？”

两个东西，卢克想。你只需要两个东西。正确的问题——和正确的答案。然后就水到渠成了。





The Maker of Cakes


Friday, 8th February, afternoon

There was a noise under Lucy's desk. It was her mobile phone, with a new text message.

Am away this weekend.

Wed 13th, salsa dancing

at Marco's Club. U coming?

From: B

14:30　8-FEB

Lucy smiled. The message was from B – her good friend Becky. Becky was always busy with something new – new clothes, a new club, a new man... She was a beautiful girl, and of course men liked her.

Lucy sent a text back.

13th OK.

From: Lucy

14:35　8-FEB

Lucy's boyfriend Sam was always busy on the 13th February, because the 14th was Valentine's Day. Sam made cakes, and had a cake shop and café called the Sunflower Café. Everybody in the town loved Sam's wonderful Valentine cakes. On the 14th February every year, the window of the Sunflower Café was full of them. 'Be my valentine!' they said, or 'Love me always.'

Lucy looked out of the window. Love me always! Oh yes, she loved Sam. They met three Christmases ago at a party. Sam was tall and quiet, but he was full of good ideas. Soon he and Lucy went everywhere together.

Sam and Lucy met three Christmases ago at a party.

'Is it love?' asked Becky after the first year.

'Of course it is,' said Lucy.

'Well, does he say, "Lucy, I can't live without you! Lucy, marry me! Be my valentine, always." Does he say all those things?' laughed Becky.

Lucy laughed too. 'No, that's not Sam. Sam doesn't say things – he does things.'

But today, Lucy thought, 'Three years is a long time to love somebody. Perhaps this year... Perhaps this Valentine's Day... Perhaps.'

Monday, 11th February, afternoon

Becky phoned Lucy on the 11th. 'I saw Sam this morning,' she said. 'He's so nice, Lucy – you're a lucky girl.'

Lucy was surprised. 'Where did you see him, Becky?'

'At the Sunflower Café, of course. I went there for a coffee.'

'Again?' Lucy thought. 'She went there three times last week, twice the week before... The Sunflower isn't near her office. Why does she always go there for coffee?'

'Oh,' she said. 'Well, Sam's very busy just now. I'm not going to see him for a day or two.'

Becky laughed. 'We've got a surprise for you, you know,' she said. 'I'm so excited. Can you wait for a few days?'

'We've got a surprise for you,' Becky laughed.

'We've got a surprise? What do you mean?' asked Lucy.

'I can't say anything now,' Becky answered. 'See you on the 13th. Bye.'

Suddenly Lucy wasn't so excited about Valentine's Day. She began to feel worried about her Sam – and beautiful Becky. What surprise? She didn't want any surprises. And a surprise from Sam and Becky? Becky often went to have coffee at Sam's café these days. Why? And Sam liked Becky, he often said that. He laughed a lot when he was with Becky. Perhaps he was in love with Becky. He didn't phone last night, he didn't phone the night before...

Wednesday, 13th February, afternoon

Late on the 13th, the Sunflower Café was busy. There were beautiful cakes everywhere, and people went out of the shop with happy smiles on their faces and big red boxes in their hands.

Sam went outside and looked at the window. He had a plan for Valentine's Day, and he was nearly ready.

'Hello, Sam.' It was Becky.

'Hi, Becky. Are you meeting Lucy?'

'Yes, we're going salsa dancing tonight. So – what's going in the window, Sam?'

'Ah, I've got a new idea. It's your idea, but better! Come into the shop.'

A moment later Lucy arrived at the door of the shop. She wanted to see Sam before she went dancing with Becky. She looked in, and saw Becky – Becky and Sam, heads together, talking and laughing. Lucy stopped at the door. 'So it's true,' she thought. 'There they are, together.' She could not hear their words, but they looked happy, so happy. Then Becky Suddenly kissed Sam on the cheek, and Sam kissed Becky back.

Lucy looked in, and saw Becky and Sam, heads together.

Lucy went quietly away, her eyes full of tears. 'My heart is breaking,' she thought. 'I love him so much – but lots of men like beautiful Becky, and now he does too.'

She took out her phone and sent a text to Becky.

Sorry. Not feeling well.

Going home to bed.

From: Lucy

17:40　13-FEB

Sam put his cakes in the window, and smiled. Becky went dancing, and laughed. Lucy went to bed – and cried.

Thursday, 14th February, morning

Lucy woke up the next morning. 'It's Valentine's Day,' she thought happily – but then she remembered Sam and Becky, and the happy smile left her face. Did it really happen?

But it was Valentine's Day. She waited until nearly nine o'clock. Perhaps a letter, some flowers, a cake from Sam? But nothing came.

Becky phoned. 'Are you OK, Lucy? How are you feeling today? Do you want to meet me at lunchtime at the Sunflower?'

'I – I don't know,' Lucy said. But she did know. She didn't want to see Sam and Becky together. She needed some time. 'It's going to be busy at work today,' she said. 'Perhaps later, OK?'

Then a text message arrived from Sam.

Can you meet me at the café?

From: Sam

08:55　14-FEB

Lucy sent her answer.

Perhaps later.

From: Lucy

08:59　14-FEB

But I'm not going to see Sam, she said to herself, and I'm not going to see Becky – and I'm not going to the shop. Valentines, love, hearts, kisses – no, thank you. And she turned off her phone and went to work.

Thursday, 14th February, afternoon

Later that afternoon Lucy turned on her phone again. There were two texts, one from Becky...

Come to the café. Exciting news!

From: B

16:32　14-FEB

and another from Sam...

Come to the café. Exciting news!

From: Sam

16:35　14-FEB

But Becky sent her text at 16:32, and Sam sent his text just three minutes later. 'So they were together,' Lucy said to herself. 'Exciting news! Well, not for me.'

She did not want to think about it. On the bus home she looked out of the window, but everywhere she saw hearts and red roses.

'Forget Valentine's Day!' Lucy said to herself when she got home. 'I'm going to watch a film.' But when she opened her door, there was a piece of paper on the floor. The message on the paper said, 'Watch the local news on TV at 18:00.' There was no name.

'Who wrote this?' Lucy said. 'Watch the news? Why?'

She turned on the TV and went to make a cup of coffee. Suddenly she heard the name 'Sam Morris' and she ran back to the TV.

'It's Valentine's Day,' said the TV reporter, 'and Sam put a message in the Sunflower Café for his girlfriend Lucy. Sam made all the cakes, and he put them in the window last night. You can see them here.'

Lucy looked. There in the window of the Sunflower Café was a big red heart cake. Around it were lots of little cakes, and they made a message – a special message for Lucy.

A message for Lucy...

'There's the message, but where's Lucy?' the reporter said. 'She often comes to the Sunflower Café, but she didn't come today. And she isn't answering her phone. Is Sam going to have a happy Valentine's Day? What's your answer, Lucy?'

But Lucy didn't tell him. She didn't even stop to turn off the TV. She got her coat and ran out of the door. She had a very important message for Sam. She didn't want to phone him, she didn't want to send a text. She wanted to give him the message, face to face.

Friday, 15th February, evening

The next evening, Becky arrived at Lucy's house. Sam opened the door.

'Congratulations, Sam!' said Becky. 'And Lucy too.'

'Congratulations, Sam! And Lucy, too,' said Becky.

'Oh, thank you, Becky. Come on in,' Lucy said.

'I've got some champagne for you,' Becky said. 'Here.'

Sam took the bottle. 'Wonderful!' he said. 'Let's drink it now.' He went away to open the bottle. Becky turned to Lucy.

'You look so happy!' she said. 'But what happened yesterday? I was really worried, you know. You didn't tell me anything on the phone this morning.'

Lucy laughed, but her face was red. 'I know. I'm sorry,' she said.

'But why didn't you answer my phone messages or my texts?' said Becky. 'Come on! Tell me everything!'

'Well,' Lucy said, 'I went to the café on the 13th, and I was at the door and... and I saw you inside with Sam. You looked so happy together. Then you kissed Sam, and he kissed you. And on Monday, you remember, you talked about a "surprise". Well, I thought that was the surprise – you and Sam.'

'Oh Lucy!' said Becky. 'That wasn't the surprise! Sam and I talked about Valentine's Day. He wanted to make a special Valentine's Day for you. So I said to him, "What do you do best, Sam? You make wonderful cakes. So make her a cake!" And he thought about it, and he had a better idea – he made lots of cakes. I kissed him because I was so excited for you.'

'Well,' said Lucy, 'when I saw you two, I got the wrong idea. And I went home. I didn't want to talk to anyone. And I really didn't want to talk to you – or Sam!'

Becky laughed. 'Oh Lucy,' she said. 'You thought – me and Sam... Well, it doesn't matter now. And I wanted to tell you – on Wednesday night at Marco's Club I met this man. He's called Matt, and he's really nice. But go on with your story.'

'On Valentine's Day I didn't answer my phone, and Sam couldn't leave the café,' Lucy said. 'So his friend Nick put a message under my door. It said, "Watch the local news on TV at 18:00." And at last I saw the cakes, and the message – and I ran to the Sunflower Café.'

'And now it's all OK,' said Becky. 'Can I see your ring? Oh, that's beautiful.'

Sam brought three glasses of champagne.

'To Lucy and Sam!' said Becky, and they all drank.

Sam looked at his watch, and turned on the TV. 'Hey, Becky, watch this,' he said. 'This is the end of the story.' After a few minutes the local news began, and they saw the same reporter from the day before. He was outside the window of the Sunflower Café.

'Everyone wanted to know the answer to Sam's question to Lucy yesterday,' the reporter said. 'Well, Sam got his answer. Lucy came to the Sunflower Café last night after she saw the news on TV. And this was her answer – here in the window!'

The television camera went closer to the window. In the window there were just four cakes now. There was the big red heart cake, and three little cakes above it.

'Lucy wanted to do that. She took my little cakes and wrote her answer with them,' said Sam. He gave Lucy a little kiss.

Becky laughed. 'Oh, you two!' she said. 'You're – wonderful!'

2月8日，星期五，下午

露西的桌子下面有东西在响，是她的手机收到了一条新短信。

我这周末出门。

13号星期三，跳萨尔萨舞

在马尔科俱乐部。你来不？

发自：B

14:30 02-08

露西笑了。这是B——她的好朋友贝姬——发来的短信。贝姬总忙着各种新的事物——新衣服、新俱乐部、新男友……她是个漂亮的女孩子，男人们当然喜欢她。

露西回了一条短信。

13号没问题。

发自：露西

14:35 02-08

露西的男友萨姆2月13号总是没有空闲，因为2月14号是情人节。萨姆是蛋糕师，他开了一家蛋糕咖啡店，名叫向日葵咖啡店。城里每个人都喜欢萨姆做的漂亮的情人节蛋糕。每年的2月14号，向日葵咖啡店的橱窗里都会摆满蛋糕。蛋糕上写着，“做我的恋人吧！”或者“永远爱我。”

露西向窗外望去。永远爱我！啊，是的，她爱萨姆。他们是在三年前的一个圣诞节派对上认识的。萨姆个子高高的，不怎么说话，不过他有很多好点子。没过多久，他和露西就形影不离了。

“这是爱吗？”一年之后贝姬问。

“当然是了。”露西说。

“哦，那他有没有说‘露西，我没有你就活不下去了！露西，嫁给我吧！做我的恋人，永远的恋人。’他说没说过这些话？”贝姬笑问。

露西也笑了。“不，那不是萨姆。萨姆从来不说 ——他总是去做 。”

可是今天，露西想，“爱一个人三年，这时间也不短了。也许今年……也许这个情人节……也许吧。”

2月11日，星期一，下午

11号那天，贝姬给露西打电话。“我今天早上看见萨姆了。”她说，“他人真好，露西——你是个幸运的女孩。”

露西感到惊讶。“你在哪里见到他的，贝姬？”

“当然是在向日葵咖啡店了。我去那儿喝了杯咖啡。”

“又去了？”露西心想，“上个星期她去了三次，再上个星期去了两次……向日葵咖啡店离她的办公室并不近。她为什么总去那里喝咖啡？”

“噢。”她说，“嗯，萨姆这阵子很忙。我这一两天都不会见他。”

贝姬笑了起来。“你知道吗，我们要给你一个惊喜。”她说，“我太兴奋了。你能再等上几天吗？”

“我们 准备了一个惊喜？你是什么意思？”露西问。

“我现在什么都不能说。”贝姬答，“13号见。拜拜。”

突然间，露西觉得情人节没那么令人激动了。她开始担心她的萨姆——还有漂亮的贝姬。什么惊喜？她不想要任何惊喜，而且还是萨姆和 贝姬的惊喜？贝姬这些天经常去萨姆的咖啡店喝咖啡。为什么呢？况且萨姆也喜欢贝姬，他常常这么说。他和贝姬在一起时总是有说有笑。也许他爱上贝姬了。他昨天晚上没打电话，前天晚上也没打电话……

2月13日，星期三，下午

13号的傍晚，向日葵咖啡店里顾客盈门。店里到处都是漂亮的蛋糕。人们走出来的时候，脸上都带着幸福的笑容，手里则拿着红色的大盒子。

萨姆走出店外，看了看橱窗。他为情人节制订了一个计划，他就要准备好了。

“你好啊，萨姆。”贝姬来了。

“嗨，贝姬。你要和露西见面吗？”

“是啊，我们今晚一起去跳萨尔萨舞。那么——橱窗里要放什么，萨姆？”

“啊，我有个新主意。其实是你的主意，但是我改进了一下！到店里来吧。”

不一会儿，露西到了咖啡店门口。她想先见见萨姆，再和贝姬去跳舞。她往店里看，看见了贝姬——贝姬和萨姆，脑袋凑在一起，有说有笑。露西在门口停住了。“看来是真的了。”她想，“他们就在那儿呢，在一起。”她听不到他俩在说什么，不过他们看上去很开心，那么开心。随后，贝姬突然亲了萨姆的脸颊，萨姆也回亲了贝姬。

露西默默地离开了，眼里满是泪水。“我的心碎了。”她想，“我那么爱他——可是很多男人都喜欢漂亮的贝姬，现在连他也不例外。”

她掏出手机，给贝姬发了一条短信。

对不起。不太舒服。

回家睡觉了。

发自：露西

17:40 02-13

萨姆把他的蛋糕放进橱窗里，笑了起来。贝姬去跳舞了，乐呵呵的。露西躺在床上——哭了。

2月14日，星期四，早上

第二天露西一觉醒来。“今天是情人节。”她高兴地想——但她随即想起了萨姆和贝姬，快乐的笑容就从她的脸上消失了。那真的发生了吗？

不过今天确实是 情人节。露西一直等到将近九点钟。也许萨姆会给她送一封信、几枝花或是一个蛋糕？可是什么也没有。

贝姬打电话过来了。“你还好吧，露西？今天感觉怎么样？想不想午餐的时候在向日葵咖啡店见个面？”

“我——我没想好。”露西说。但是她已经想好了。她不想看到萨姆和贝姬在一起的样子。她需要一些时间。“今天工作会忙。”她说，“也许晚些时候，好吗？”

之后她收到了萨姆的一条短信。

你能到咖啡店和我见个面吗？

发自：萨姆

08:55 02-14

露西回复：

也许晚些时候吧。

发自：露西

08:59 02-14

不过我不会去见萨姆的，她自言自语，我也不会去见贝姬——我不会去店里的。情人，爱情，桃心，吻——我都不要了。她关了手机去上班。

2月14日，星期四，下午

那天下午晚些时候，露西又打开了手机。有两条短信，一条来自贝姬……

快来咖啡店。激动人心的消息！

发自：B

16:32 02-14

另一条来自萨姆……

快来咖啡店。激动人心的消息！

发自：萨姆

16:35 02-14

可是，贝姬16点32分发的短信，萨姆是三分钟之后发的。“这么说他们是在一起的。”露西自言自语，“激动人心的消息！哼，我可不觉得。”

她不愿去想这件事。坐公交车回家的路上，她往窗外望去，可满眼都是桃心和红玫瑰。

“忘了情人节吧！”露西到家时对自己说，“我要看电影。”但当她打开家门的时候，发现地板上有一张纸。纸上写着：“看电视18:00的本地新闻。”没有落款。

“这是谁写的？”露西说，“看新闻？为什么？”

她打开了电视，然后去弄一杯咖啡。突然她听见了“萨姆·莫里斯”这个名字，于是赶紧跑回电视前。

“今天是情人节。”电视记者说，“萨姆在向日葵咖啡店展示了一条给他女友的信息。他做了这些蛋糕，昨晚把它们摆在了橱窗里。观众们可以从这里看到蛋糕。”

露西看着。在向日葵咖啡店的橱窗里有一个大大的红色心形蛋糕。周围放了很多小蛋糕，小蛋糕组成了一条信息——一条给露西的特别的信息。

“信息在那儿，可露西在哪儿？”记者说，“她经常来向日葵咖啡店，可今天却没来，还一直不接电话。萨姆会有一个快乐的情人节吗？你的答复是什么，露西？”

不过露西没有告诉他。她甚至都没把电视关上。她拿上大衣就跑出门。她有很重要的话要对萨姆说。她不想给他打电话，也不想发短信。她想把这些话告诉他，面对面地告诉他。

2月15日，星期五，傍晚

第二天傍晚，贝姬来到露西的家。萨姆开了门。

“恭喜你，萨姆！”贝姬说，“还有露西，也恭喜你啊。”

“噢，谢谢你，贝姬。进来吧。”露西说。

“我给你们带来了香槟。”贝姬说，“这儿。”

萨姆接过瓶子。“棒极了！”他说，“我们现在就喝吧。”他到一旁去开酒瓶。贝姬转过身来看着露西。

“你看上去真幸福！”她说，“不过昨天是怎么回事？你知道吗，我真的很担心。你今早在电话里可什么也没告诉我。”

露西笑了起来，但她的脸红了。“我知道。我很抱歉。”她说。

“那你为什么不回我的电话留言，也不回我的短信？”贝姬说，“来！把一切都告诉我！”

“嗯。”露西说，“我13号那天去了咖啡店，当时我站在门口，然后……然后我看到你和萨姆在店里。你们在一起看起来很快乐。然后你亲了萨姆一下，他也亲了你。而且星期一的时候，你还记得吧，你说会有一个‘惊喜’。呃，我以为惊喜是——你和萨姆。”

“啊，露西！”贝姬说，“那可不是我说的惊喜！萨姆和我在讨论情人节的事。他想为你准备一个特别的情人节。所以我就和他说：‘你最擅长什么，萨姆？你做的蛋糕特别棒。那就给她做个蛋糕吧！’他就一直在想这件事，后来他有了一个更好的主意——他做了好多好多的蛋糕。我亲他是因为我太为你感到激动了。”

“噢，”露西说，“我看到你们在一起，我误会了。然后我就回了家。我不想和任何人说话。我特别不想和你 ——还有萨姆说话！”

贝姬笑了。“噢，露西。”她说，“你以为——我和萨姆……算了，现在这些都无所谓了。我还想告诉你——周三晚上在马尔科俱乐部，我认识了一个人。他叫马特，他人非常好。不过，你继续说你的故事吧。”

“情人节那天，我没有接电话，萨姆又不能离开咖啡店。”露西说，“所以他的朋友尼克就在我的门下留了言。上面写着：‘看电视18:00的本地新闻。’我这才看到那些蛋糕和萨姆的信息——于是我就跑 到向日葵咖啡店。”

“现在一切都好了。”贝姬说，“我能看看你的戒指吗？啊，真美。”

萨姆端来了三杯香槟。

“为露西和萨姆干杯！”贝姬说，他们三个人一起喝了香槟。

萨姆看了看手表，打开了电视。“嘿，贝姬，看这个。”他说，“这是故事的结局。”过了几分钟，本地新闻开始了，他们看到了昨天的那位记者。他正在向日葵咖啡店的橱窗外。

“每个人都想知道，萨姆昨天向露西提出的问题得到了怎样的答复。”那个记者说，“好了，萨姆得到了答复。昨天晚上，露西在电视上看到新闻之后，就来到了向日葵咖啡店。这就是她的答复——往橱窗里看！”

电视的摄像机对着橱窗逐渐拉近。橱窗里现在只有四个蛋糕——那个大大的红色心形蛋糕，还有上方三个小蛋糕。

“是露西要这么做的。她用我的小蛋糕写下了答复。”萨姆说。他轻轻地吻了露西一下。

贝姬笑了。“啊，瞧你们俩！”她说，“你们——真是太棒了！”





The Bridge


Alma closed the door of her parents' home, and she and her friend Barbara stood in the sun for a moment. 'Your mother is so nice, Alma,' said Barbara. 'She said to me, "We love to see Alma's friends." She wants me to stay for a week!'

Alma smiled. 'She likes you, Barbara. You're a good friend to me, and my mother knows that,' she said. She looked around her at the street. 'After six years away, this city feels very different to me.'

Barbara smiled. 'Yes,' she said, 'after your six years in Vienna, you're more Austrian than I am. But Everything feels different now, it's true. Six long years of study – and now we're doctors!'

'And next month Everything changes for you again,' Alma said. 'A new life in Salzburg. I'm really happy for you.'

'A new life, a new city, a new hospital,' said Barbara. 'It's a famous hospital, too. I'm lucky to get work there.' She turned to her friend. 'But what about you, Alma? What are you going to do? Are you going back to live in Vienna again? Or are you going to look for work here?'

'I don't know,' said Alma slowly. 'Before I can answer that question, I need to tell you a story. The story of Nina.' They started walking to the river, and Alma began her story.

'I need to tell you a story,' said Alma. 'The story of Nina...'

Nina was my little sister. She was beautiful – much more beautiful than me, with her black hair and green eyes. And she was full of life, and clever too.

There were always boyfriends at the door, but they changed all the time. Then when she was eighteen, she began to study at the university. One day she came home with a smile on her face.

'What is it, Nina?' I asked. 'You look excited about something. Or is it somebody? Tell me!'

'I met someone today,' she said happily. 'He's called Dragan and he's studying maths too. And he's... he's wonderful .'

'That's great, Nina,' I said. 'Where in the city does he live?'

My sister did not answer this question. She began to talk about a party on Friday night. I looked at her face carefully. I knew my little sister very well.

'Nina,' I said. 'Come on, tell me. Where does Dragan live?'

Again, Nina said nothing, but I knew the answer. It was bad news – bad news for Nina, bad news for our parents, bad news for everyone.

Two weeks later, Nina brought Dragan to our house. Dragan was tall and dark, with bright eyes and a quick smile. He loved Nina, and she loved him – we could all see that. Dragan had dinner with us, and then we had coffee and talked. Then my father spoke.

Dragan loved Nina, and she loved him – we could all see that.

'Dragan,' he said, 'your people are not our people.'

I looked at Nina. She was quiet, and watched my father carefully, but she said nothing. Dragan looked worried.

'We live on this side of the river, and your people live on the other side,' my father said. 'We have our places of worship, and you have yours. We are different. We have our ways, and your people have their ways. It was like that when I was a boy, and it is still like that now.'

Then he smiled.

'But we can be friends,' he said. 'You are a good man, and my daughter loves you. Anybody can see that. Our door is always open to you, Dragan.'

'Thank you,' said Dragan quietly. And Nina smiled – at him, at my father, at me, at everybody.

After that, they were always together. At the university, at home, in town – it was always Nina and Dragan. They studied together and went to parties together. They were two young people, happy and in love.

And then the war began. At first things were difficult, but they could still meet sometimes. But then things began to change. When the university closed, Nina and Dragan could not see each other every day. They talked on the phone, but it was not the same.

'I can't live without him,' Nina said to us one night, with tears on her face. 'I must see him! I must.'

'I can't live without him,' Nina said.

'Nina, you can't cross the bridge,' my father said. 'It's dangerous for you over there. There are men with guns everywhere, and they watch the bridge night and day. And Dragan can't come here – not now. We must all wait. Perhaps one day you can see him again.'

'Wait?' said Nina, and the tears came to her eyes again. 'For how long?'

A week later, Nina left our house very early one morning. Nobody heard her. Dragan left his house, too, and they both walked carefully and quietly to the bridge. They just wanted to see each other. Nina left a message for us in her room.

'I'm not going onto the bridge,' the message said, 'but I must see him. I can't wait any longer.'

We waited all day. Where was she? My mother phoned all our friends, but nobody had any news. Then that evening an old friend of the family came to the door.

'I have some terrible news,' he said. 'I'm so sorry, so sorry.'

At once my mother began to cry. My father put his arm around her. 'Tell us,' he said. 'It's about my daughter, yes? My little Nina...'

'It happened this morning,' our friend said. 'On the bridge. Your daughter saw her boyfriend Dragan on the other side. She called his name, and he ran onto the bridge – and somebody shot him. When he fell, she ran onto the bridge at once. She took him in her arms, but somebody shot her too. They died on the bridge together. We are trying to bring their bodies back, but it's very difficult. I am very sorry.'

'Your daughter ran onto the bridge at once.'

I went to Nina's room. Next to her bed, there was a photo of her and Dragan. She told me once, 'I can't live without him.' And it was true. But now they are together – for ever.

So we waited. Those were terrible days. Nobody said very much, and my mother cried a lot. In my room at night, I cried too. And then, on a beautiful spring day, we went to a hill above the town. It was sunny all day. Nina loved the sun, I remembered. And there we buried them together – my sister Nina, and her Dragan.

For a few minutes, the two women did not speak. They walked slowly along by the river. The water was bright in the sunlight.

Then Barbara said, 'And when did you leave and go to Austria?'

'A week later,' Alma said. 'My parents sent me to my mother's sister Ana in Vienna. I did not want to leave them, but it was dangerous here – more dangerous every day. They did not want to lose two daughters. Ana was good to me – she understood. She helped me to begin my studies again.'

'And now you are back in your home town,' said Barbara. 'Why now?'

'When the war ended,' Alma said, 'I wanted to come back. But I wasn't ready. "Finish your studies first," my parents said, and they were right. But now it's the right time. I needed to see my family, and I needed to go to the bridge.'

Alma stopped, and turned to her friend. Her face was white. 'And there it is,' she said, very quietly. 'Just along the river. Look. You can see it now.'

'And there it is,' Alma said. 'Just along the river.'

Barbara took her friend's arm. 'Let's go over there to that café,' she said. 'You need to sit down.'

'The Bridge Café,' said Alma. 'I remember it – Nina often waited for Dragan there. Yes, let's go there – I feel close to Nina there.'

They crossed the road and sat down at a table outside the café. They both had coffee, and Alma began to look better.

'Are you OK?' asked Barbara.

'Yes, thanks,' said Alma. 'I just need some time – and some more coffee perhaps.'

Barbara felt the warm sun on her face. 'This is a difficult day for Alma,' she thought. 'But the sun's shining, and people are doing the usual things – working, driving around, shopping, talking, having coffee... Perhaps that can help her.'

Alma and Barbara had another coffee, and watched the river. Just then a big black car stopped near the bridge. A beautiful young woman in a long white dress got out of the car with a young man. She carried a bouquet of white flowers in one hand, and the young man held her other hand. They walked onto the bridge, and when they got to the middle, they stopped. The young woman took two flowers from her bouquet. She dropped one flower into the river, and her husband dropped the second flower.

Alma and Barbara watched all this. 'What are they doing?' Alma whispered. 'Find out for me, Barbara. Ask somebody.'

Barbara turned to a man at the next table. 'Excuse me,' she said. 'I'm a visitor here. Can you answer a question for me?'

'Yes, of course,' the man said. 'What do you want to know?'

'Those two young people on the bridge,' said Barbara. 'What are they doing? Why are they dropping flowers into the water?'

'It's their wedding day,' said the man. 'In the war, two young lovers died on the bridge. They were called Nina and Dragan. We don't want to forget them. Now, after a wedding, people come here and drop two flowers into the river – one for Nina, one for Dragan. Watch them now – they are saying their names.'

Barbara was afraid to look at Alma's face. Alma sat so still, so still.

On the bridge, the man and woman watched the flowers in the water for a moment. The man put his arm around his young wife. Then they walked slowly back to the car and drove away.

'Who did it first? I don't know,' said the man at the next table. 'But now everybody comes here on their wedding day. We all remember the war, of course we do, but we must remember love too. Love is more important than war.'

'Thank you,' said Barbara. 'Thank you very much for telling us that story.'

She looked at Alma's white face. 'Come,' she said quietly. 'Let's walk onto the bridge together.'

She took Alma's arm and they walked onto the bridge. At the middle of the bridge Barbara stopped, and looked out over the river.

'Look,' she said to Alma. 'The flowers are still there. Do you see? Flowers for Nina and Dragan. That's so beautiful.'

The two white flowers were bright in the sun.

'Love is more important than war,' Alma whispered. There were tears on her face, and she watched the flowers for a long time. Then she looked at Barbara, and slowly smiled.

'Love is more important than war.'

'Barbara, I know the answer to my question,' she said. 'I can live here again. This is my home.'

They walked off the bridge. The two flowers, together in the water, moved slowly away on the river.

桥


阿尔玛关上父母家的门，她和朋友芭芭拉在阳光下站了一会儿。

“你妈妈人真好，阿尔玛。”芭芭拉说，“她对我说：‘我们很高兴见到阿尔玛的朋友。’她希望我在这儿住一个星期！”

阿尔玛笑了。“她喜欢你，芭芭拉。你是我的好朋友，我妈妈知道的。”她说。她环顾街道四周。“出去六年了，这座城市让我感觉大不一样了。”

芭芭拉笑了。“是啊。”她说，“你在维也纳住了六年，比我更像一个奥地利人了。不过现在感觉一切都变了，这是真的。六年的学习生涯——现在我们都是医生了！”

“下个月，你的一切又要改变了。”阿尔玛说，“萨尔茨堡的新生活。我真为你高兴。”

“新的生活，新的城市，新的医院。”芭芭拉说，“那也是家著名的医院。我能得到那里的工作机会真是幸运。”她转向她的朋友。“那你呢，阿尔玛？你想做什么？你打算回维也纳住吗？还是准备在这里找工作？”

“我不知道。”阿尔玛慢悠悠地说，“回答这个问题之前，我要给你讲个故事。尼娜的故事。”她们往河边走去，阿尔玛开始讲了起来。

尼娜是我的妹妹。她很漂亮——比我漂亮多了，黑头发，绿眼睛。她充满活力，而且人很聪明。

她总有男朋友在门口等候，只不过一直在换人。她十八岁时上大学。有一天她回到家，脸上挂着笑容。

“怎么了，尼娜？”我问，“你一脸兴奋，是因为什么事，还是因为什么人？告诉我！”

“我今天认识了一个人。”她开心地说，“他叫德拉甘，他也是学数学的。而且，他……他棒极了 。”

“那很好啊，尼娜。”我说，“他住在城里哪个地方？”

我妹妹没有回答这个问题。她讲起了周五晚上的一个派对。我端详着她的脸。我很了解我的妹妹。

“尼娜，”我说，“来，告诉我，德拉甘住在哪儿？”

尼娜又没有回答，不过我已经知道答案了。这是个坏消息——对尼娜、对我们的父母、对任何人来说都是个坏消息。

两个星期之后，尼娜把德拉甘带到了家里。德拉甘个子高高的，皮肤黝黑，眼睛明亮，脸上随时带着笑容。他爱尼娜，尼娜也爱他——我们都看得出来。德拉甘和我们一起吃了晚餐，然后大家一起边喝咖啡边聊天。这时候我爸爸说话了。

“德拉甘，”他说，“你们和我们不是一种人。”

我看着尼娜。她不作声，小心翼翼地看着爸爸，却一句话也不说。德拉甘看上去有些担忧。

“我们住在河的这边，你们住在河的那边。”我爸爸说，“我们有我们做礼拜的地方，你们也有你们的。你们和我们是不同的。我们有我们的方式，你们有你们的方式。我还是个孩子的时候就是如此，至今也依然如此。”

然后他笑了。

“但我们可以做朋友。”他说，“你是个好人，我的女儿爱你。大家都能看出来。我们家的门永远为你打开，德拉甘。”

“谢谢。”德拉甘轻声说。尼娜笑了——冲着德拉甘，冲着我爸爸，冲着我，冲着每一个人笑了。

从那以后，他们形影不离。在大学，在家，在城里——总能看到两人在一起。他们一起学习，一起参加派对。他们是两个快乐且沐浴在爱河中的年轻人。

随后战争爆发了。开始的时候，情况不好，但他们有时还能见面。可是后来形势就改变了。大学停了课，尼娜和德拉甘不能天天见面了。他们打电话，但是电话与见面是不一样的。

“我的生命里不能没有他。”有天晚上，尼娜流着泪对我们说，“我一定要见到他！一定要。”

“尼娜，你不能过桥。”我爸爸说，“那边对你来说太危险了。那里到处都是拿着枪的人，他们日夜监视着那座桥。而且，德拉甘也不能过来——现在不行。我们都得等。或许有一天你能再见到他。”

“等？”尼娜说，她的眼泪又再次涌出来。“要等多久呢？”

一个星期之后的一个早上，尼娜一大清早离开了家。没有人听到她出门，德拉甘也离开了他家。他们小心谨慎地、悄悄地往桥那边走去。他们只是想见见对方。尼娜在她的房间里给我们留了字条。

“我不会走上桥的，”字条上写道，“但我一定要见到他。我不能再等了。”

我们等了一整天。她去哪儿了？我妈妈给所有的朋友打了电话，但没有人知道她的下落。然后傍晚时，我家的一位老朋友找上门来。

“我有个令人难过的消息。”他说，“我感到非常，非常惋惜。”

我妈妈一下子就哭了出来。我爸爸搂住她。“告诉我们吧。”他说，“是关于我们女儿的，对吧？我的小尼娜……”

“这是今天早上发生的事情。”我们的朋友说，“在桥上发生的。你们女儿看见她的男朋友德拉甘在桥的另一头。她喊他的名字，他就跑上了桥——然后有人向他开枪。他倒下了，尼娜就立刻跑上了桥。她把他抱在怀里，但同样被枪击。他们一起死在桥上。我们正想办法把他们的尸体弄回来，但太困难了。我非常抱歉。”

我走进尼娜的房间。她床边放着她和德拉甘的合影。她曾经对我说：“我的生命里不能没有他。”这是真的。不过现在，他们在一起了——永远在一起。

于是我们等待着。那段日子真是难捱。大家都沉默寡言，我妈妈哭了不知多少次。晚上，我在自己的房间里也会哭。后来，在春光明媚的一天，我们登上一座可以俯视这座城市的小山。那天一整天天气晴朗。尼娜喜欢阳光，我记得。我们就在那儿把他们俩埋葬了——我的妹妹尼娜和她的德拉甘。

过了好几分钟，两个女孩都没有说话。她们沿河边慢慢地走着。河水在阳光下泛着波光。

后来芭芭拉说：“你是什么时候离开这里去奥地利的？”

“一个星期后。”阿尔玛说，“我父母把我送到维也纳的安娜阿姨那里。我不想离开他们，但这里太危险了——一天比一天危险。他们不想失去两个女儿。安娜对我很好——她理解我。她帮助我重新开始了学业。”

“现在你回到自己的家乡了。”芭芭拉说，“为什么现在回来呢？”

“战争结束之后，”阿尔玛说，“我就想回来。不过我还没准备好。‘先完成你的学业。’我父母说。他们是对的。但现在时机正合适。我需要回来看看我的家人，我需要去那座桥上看看。”

阿尔玛停下了脚步，转向她的朋友。她脸色苍白。“那边就是了。”她说，声音细若无声。“沿着河边。看，你现在能看到了。”

芭芭拉扶着她朋友的胳膊。“我们去那边的咖啡店吧。”她说，“你需要坐一会儿。”

“桥头咖啡店。”阿尔玛说，“我记得——尼娜经常在那里等德拉甘。好，我们去那儿——在那儿我会觉得离尼娜很近。”

她们穿过马路，在咖啡店外面的一张桌子旁坐了下来。她们喝了些咖啡，阿尔玛看上去好些了。

“你还好吗？”芭芭拉问。

“还好，谢谢。”阿尔玛说，“我只是需要一些时间——或许再喝点咖啡。”

芭芭拉感到阳光晒在脸上暖暖的。“今天对阿尔玛来说是难熬的一天。”她想，“然而阳光灿烂，人们一切如常——工作，开车转悠，购物，谈天，喝咖啡……也许这些能对她有帮助。”

阿尔玛和芭芭拉又点了咖啡，然后望着河水。这时，一辆黑色的大轿车停在了桥边。一位身穿白色长裙的漂亮年轻女子和一位年轻男子从车里走了下来。她一只手捧着一束白花，另一只手让年轻男子牵着。他们走上桥，走到桥中间的时候停了下来。那年轻女子从花束中抽出两枝花。她把一枝丢进了河里，她丈夫将另一枝丢进了河里。

阿尔玛和芭芭拉看着这一切。“他们在做什么呢？”阿尔玛小声说，“帮我弄清楚，芭芭拉。找个人问问吧。”

芭芭拉转向邻桌的一个男子。“打扰一下，”她说，“我是个游客。可以回答我一个问题吗？”

“当然可以。”那个男子说，“你想知道什么？”

“桥上的两个年轻人。”芭芭拉说，“他们在做什么呢？他们为什么把花儿扔到水里？”

“他们今天举行婚礼。”那个男子说，“战争时期，一对年轻情侣死在了这座桥上。他们名叫尼娜和德拉甘。我们不愿忘记他们。如今，婚礼过后，人们会来这里往河里丢两枝花——一枝给尼娜，一枝给德拉甘。你看那两个年轻人，他们在念尼娜和德拉甘的名字呢。”

芭芭拉不敢看阿尔玛的脸色。阿尔玛僵坐着，一动不动。

在桥上，男女二人望了一会儿水里的花。男子搂住年轻的妻子。随后他们慢慢地回到了车里，开着车走了。

“谁最先这么做的？我不知道。”邻桌的男子说，“不过如今人们在婚礼当天都会到这里来。我们不会忘记战争，那是当然的，但我们也不会忘记爱情。爱情比战争更重要。”

“谢谢你。”芭芭拉说，“非常感谢你告诉我们这个故事。”

她看着阿尔玛苍白的面颊。“来，”她轻轻地说，“我们一起往桥上走走。”

她挽起阿尔玛的胳膊，两个人走上了桥。走到桥中央的时候，芭芭拉停住了脚步，向河面望去。

“看啊，”她对阿尔玛说，“花儿还在那儿呢。你看到了吗？献给尼娜和德拉甘的花。真美。”

两朵白花在阳光下亮闪闪的。

“爱情比战争更重要。”阿尔玛轻声说。她脸上挂着泪水，盯着那两朵花看了很长时间。然后她看着芭芭拉，渐渐地露出了笑容。

“芭芭拉，我的那个问题有答案了。”她说，“我可以重新住在这里。这里是我的家。”

她们走下了桥。水中相伴的那两朵花，在河面上缓缓地漂远了。

内容简介


世事难预料，乌龙免不了。在这六个短剧中，总有或大或小的麻烦来给剧中人的生活加点儿料。

管家詹姆斯对“先生”总是唯命是从。他总是说：“好的，先生。”这一点使他成为一个好管家。可是有一天，“先生”吩咐詹姆斯做一件很不寻常的事，詹姆斯有没有遵命照办呢？

大多数办事员对上司也是唯命是从。他们知道有什么事情是该做的，有什么事情是不该做的。他们说：“得照章办事。”这可害苦了到办证处给宠物猴子办许可证的老兄！

罗杰的问题是没什么钱，他富有的女朋友却为他迟迟不求婚而烦恼。事情似乎很容易解决，不过就像书中其他短剧一样，问题可要复杂得多，也有趣得多。

THE BUTLER DID ITAND OTHER PLAYS

AND OTHER PLAYS

Things go wrong, and funny things happen, in these six short plays. There is always something which causes problems for someone.

James, the butler, always does what 'sir' tells him. 'Very good, sir,' he says. That's what makes him a good butler. But one day 'sir' asks James to do something very unusual. Does James do it or not?

Most office workers do what their employer tells them, too. They know exactly what people must or must not do. 'Rules are rules,' they say. This makes life difficult for the man with the monkey, when he visits the licensing office!

Roger's problem is that he hasn't got much money. His rich girlfriend's problem is that he hasn't asked her to marry him. There seems to be an easy answer, but as in all these plays, things are more difficult, and much funnier, than that.





The Butler Did It


INTRODUCTION

Henry Fletcher is working in his office. He is thinking about his wife. What's she doing at the moment? Has she got a boyfriend? Perhaps she has, perhaps she hasn't. Is she with her lover now? He wants to know! So he phones home. But only James, the butler, answers...

CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY

James, a butler

Henry Fletcher, a husband

PERFORMANCE NOTES

There are two rooms on the stage, with a wall between them. One is a dining room, where James the butler is getting the table ready for dinner. There is a telephone in the room. The other room is an office, where Henry Fletcher is working. He is sitting in front of his computer, but he isn't looking at it. He is making a phone call.

You will need two telephones and a gun.

The plumber's name, Blessiu, sounds like 'Bless you!' which is what we often say when someone sneezes.

The phone rings in the dining room. James stops work and answers it.

JAMES

Hello.

HENRY

Hello, is that James, the butler?

JAMES

Yes, sir, it is.

HENRY

James, is my wife at home?

JAMES

Yes, sir.

HENRY

Good. Can you bring her to the phone? I want to speak to her at once. Be quick!

JAMES

Very good, sir. So you want me to bring your wife to the phone. Is that right, sir?

HENRY

Yes, yes, James. Now just go and do it. (James goes off slowly. Henry speaks to himself.) My wife's got a lover, I think. But I must know! What's James doing? And where's my wife?

James comes back slowly and speaks into the phone.

JAMES

Hello, sir. James speaking.

HENRY

Hello, James. So where's my wife?

JAMES

Your wife is at home, sir, but she can't speak to you at the moment, I'm afraid.

HENRY

She can't speak to me! My wife can't speak to me! Why not?

JAMES

Well, sir, she's in the bathroom...

HENRY

In the bathroom!

JAMES

...with a man.

HENRY

(Putting a hand to his head ) With a man!

JAMES

But don't worry, sir, it's only Mr Blessiu, the plumber. He's working in the bathroom.

HENRY

(Not listening, speaking to himself ) She's in the bathroom with her boyfriend! I knew it! James, can you do something for me?

JAMES

Of course, sir.

HENRY

Go into my bedroom, and find the box under my bed. In that box there's a gun. Take it out, James.

JAMES

Very good, sir. You want me to go into your bedroom, find the box under your bed, and take out the gun. Is that right, sir?

HENRY

Yes, James, yes! Just go and do it.

James goes off slowly. Henry speaks to himself.

HENRY

I knew it! My wife's got a lover! But soon James is going to come back with that gun, and then...

James comes back with the gun.

JAMES

(Into the phone ) Hello, sir, James here.

HENRY

Hello, James. Have you got the gun?

JAMES

Yes, sir. I went into your bedroom, found the box under your bed, and took out the gun. I have it with me now, sir.

HENRY

Right, James. Now listen carefully.

JAMES

I'm listening very carefully, sir.

'Hello, sir, James here.'

HENRY

Go into the bathroom...

JAMES

Yes, sir.

HENRY

...with the gun...

JAMES

Yes, sir.

HENRY

...and shoot my wife through the head.

JAMES

Yes, sir.

HENRY

And the man in the bathroom with her, James, shoot him through the head too. (He sneezes .)

JAMES

Blessiu, sir?

HENRY

Thank you, James. Now, James, do you understand what to do?

JAMES

Yes, sir. You want me to go into the bathroom with the gun, shoot your wife through the head, and shoot the man with her through the head, too, sir. (He sneezes. )

HENRY

Bless you, James!

JAMES

That' s right, sir.

HENRY

Very good, James. Well, just go and do it.

James goes off. We hear two gun shots.

HENRY

(Looking pleased and smiling to himself ) Aha! Good old James! Well done!

James comes back slowly, without the gun.

JAMES

(Into the phone ) Hello, sir. Did you hear the shots, sir?

'Did you hear the shots, sir?'

HENRY

Yes, James, I did. Is everything all right?

JAMES

Oh yes, sir. I went into the bathroom with the gun, and I shot your wife through the head, and I shot the man with her through the head, too.

He sneezes.

HENRY

Bless you, James!

JAMES

That's right, sir.

HENRY

Right, and are the two of them dead, James?

JAMES

Oh yes, sir.

HENRY

Very good, James. Oh, and James...

JAMES

Yes, sir?

HENRY

What did you do with the gun?

JAMES

The gun, sir?

HENRY

Yes, James, the gun. What did you do with it?

JAMES

Ah, yes, sir. I put it in the swimming pool.

HENRY

The swimming pool, James?

JAMES

The swimming pool in the back garden, sir.

HENRY

(Looking afraid ) But we haven't got a swimming pool in our back garden!

Nobody says anything for a moment.

JAMES

Oh, I see. Well, then, you've got the wrong number, I'm afraid, sir. Goodbye.

HENRY

Oh, I – er – Goodbye.

James goes back to his work, getting the table ready for dinner. He is smiling and singing quietly to himself.

Henry sits in his chair, with a very white face.

准备两部电话和一把枪。

管道工的名字是布莱修，听起来就像“Bless you!（上帝保佑你！）”。有人打喷嚏时，我们常常说这句话。

（本剧本为荒诞题材作品）

饭厅里的电话响起来。詹姆斯停下手里的活儿去接电话。

詹姆斯：

喂。

亨利：

喂，是管家詹姆斯吗？

詹姆斯：

是的，先生，是我。

亨利：

詹姆斯，我妻子在家吗？

詹姆斯：

在，先生。

亨利：

很好。你能让她来接电话吗？我想马上跟她讲话。快点儿！

詹姆斯：

好的，先生。您是让我去请您妻子来接电话，对吗，先生？

亨利：

对，对，詹姆斯。现在就去叫她来。（詹姆斯慢条斯理地下场。亨利自言自语。） 我觉得我妻子有个情人。不过我得弄清楚！詹姆斯在干什么？我妻子在哪儿呢？

詹姆斯慢条斯理地走回来，接起电话。

詹姆斯：

喂，先生。我是詹姆斯。

亨利：

喂，詹姆斯。我妻子在哪儿？

詹姆斯：

您妻子在家，先生，但是恐怕现在不能跟您讲话。

亨利：

她不能跟我讲话！我妻子不能跟我讲话！为什么不能？

詹姆斯：

呃，先生，她在卫生间……

亨利：

在卫生间！

詹姆斯：

……跟一个男人在一起。

亨利：

（以手抚头） 跟一个男人在一起！

詹姆斯：

不过别担心，先生，那个人是管道工布莱修先生。他正在卫生间干活儿。

亨利：

（没听电话，自言自语） 她跟她的情人在卫生间里！我就知道！詹姆斯，你能替我做件事吗？

詹姆斯：

当然，先生。

亨利：

去我的卧室，把我床下的盒子找出来。盒子里有把枪，把它拿出来，詹姆斯。

詹姆斯：

好的，先生。您要我去您的卧室，找到您床下的盒子，把里面的枪拿出来，是吗，先生？

亨利：

是的，詹姆斯，是的！现在就去拿！

詹姆斯慢条斯理地下场。亨利自言自语。

亨利：

我就知道！我妻子有了情人！不过很快詹姆斯就会拿着枪回来，然后……

詹姆斯拿着枪回来了。

詹姆斯：

（对着电话） 喂，先生，我是詹姆斯。

亨利：

喂，詹姆斯，你拿到枪了吗？

詹姆斯：

拿到了，先生。我进了您的卧室，在您床下找到了那个盒子，把枪拿出来了。我现在就拿着枪呢，先生。

亨利：

好的，詹姆斯。现在听好了。

詹姆斯：

我在仔细听着呢，先生。

亨利：

去卫生间……

詹姆斯：

好的，先生。

亨利：

……带着枪……

詹姆斯：

好的，先生。

亨利：

……朝我妻子头上开一枪。

詹姆斯：

好的，先生。

亨利：

还有那个跟她一起在卫生间的人，詹姆斯，朝他头上也开一枪。（他打了个喷嚏。）

詹姆斯：

布莱修，先生？

亨利：

谢谢，詹姆斯。［译者注：亨利以为詹姆斯说的是“Bless you.（上帝保佑你。）”。］ 现在，詹姆斯，你明白要做什么了吗？

詹姆斯：

明白了，先生。您要我拿着枪到卫生间去，朝您妻子的头上开一枪，再朝那个跟她在一起的男人头上开一枪，先生。（他打了喷嚏。）

亨利：

上帝保佑你，詹姆斯！

詹姆斯：

是的，先生。［译者注：詹姆斯以为亨利说的是“Blessiu（布莱修）”。］

亨利：

很好，詹姆斯。好了，去干吧。

詹姆斯下。我们听到两声枪响。

亨利：

（看上去很满意，暗自笑了笑） 啊哈！好样的詹姆斯！干得好！

詹姆斯慢条斯理地回来了，手里没有拿枪。

詹姆斯：

（对着电话） 喂，先生。您听到枪响了吗，先生？

亨利：

听到了，詹姆斯，我听到了。一切都顺利吗？

詹姆斯：

哦，是的，先生。我拿着枪进了卫生间，朝您妻子头上开了一枪，又朝那个跟她在一起的男人头上开了一枪。

他打了个喷嚏。

亨利：

上帝保佑你，詹姆斯！

詹姆斯：

是的，先生。［译者注：詹姆斯以为亨利说的是“Blessiu（布莱修）”。］

亨利：

好的，他们俩都死了吗，詹姆斯？

詹姆斯：

哦，是的，先生。

亨利：

很好，詹姆斯。哦，对了，詹姆斯……

詹姆斯：

什么事，先生？

亨利：

你怎么处理那把枪的？

詹姆斯：

那把枪吗，先生？

亨利：

是的，詹姆斯，那把枪。你是怎么处理它的？

詹姆斯：

啊，对了，先生，我把它放到游泳池里了。

亨利：

游泳池吗，詹姆斯？

詹姆斯：

后花园里的游泳池，先生。

亨利：

（面露惧色） 可是我们后花园里没有游泳池啊！

两人沉默了片刻。

詹姆斯：

哦，我明白了。好吧，那么恐怕您打错电话了，先生。再见。

亨利：

哦，我——呃——再见。

詹姆斯继续干活儿，往餐桌上摆放餐具。他面露微笑，轻轻哼着歌。亨利则坐在椅子上，面色惨白。





Old Friends


INTRODUCTION

Celia is sitting at a street café one day, drinking coffee, when suddenly she sees an old school friend, Amanda. The two women are happy to talk about old times and the men in their lives. They always like very different men, of course...

CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY

Celia, a woman of about 45

Amanda, her school friend

Waiter

Robert, a man of about 45

PERFORMANCE NOTES

The scene is a street café. There are tables and chairs outside. The waiter sometimes comes out of the café to see if anyone wants anything. Celia is sitting at one of the tables. She is wearing a big, expensive ring on the ring finger of her left hand.

You will need a cup of coffee, a bottle or glass of coke, and Celia's ring.

Amanda is walking past the café. Celia suddenly sees her and calls to her.

CELIA

Amanda? Is it you?

AMANDA

Sorry? Do I know you?

CELIA

Of course you do. It's me, Celia. We were at school together.

AMANDA

Celia! How wonderful to see you again!

CELIA

Do you remember me now?

AMANDA

Oh yes, but you do look different.

CELIA

Older, perhaps?

AMANDA

Well, yes.

CELIA

Well, I am older! So are you! Sit down and have a drink with me.

AMANDA

Yes, why not? (She sits down at the table. )

CELIA

What are you going to have? Coffee?

AMANDA

Oh, a coke, I think.

CELIA

(Calling ) Waiter! (The waiter comes to the table. )

WAITER

Good morning. What would you like?

CELIA

A coffee for me, please, and a coke for my friend.

WAITER

Would you like a sandwich or anything? They're very good.

CELIA

No, no, thank you. Just the drinks.

WAITER

Right. (He goes off .)

AMANDA

Well, this is nice! When did we last meet? About fifteen years ago, was it?

CELIA

Twenty-five, Amanda.

AMANDA

Twenty-five? No! It can't be! Do you sometimes see any of our old friends?

CELIA

No, no, I don't.

The waiter brings the drinks and puts them on the table.

WAITER

Here you are, one coffee and one coke.

AMANDA

(To him ) Thank you. (To Celia ) I say, do you remember Rod Hunk? All the girls liked him! What happened to him, do you think?

CELIA

Oh, I don't know. I didn't like him much. But what about Rocky Rambo? You and he were together at one time, I think.

AMANDA

Ah yes, but he left me years ago.

CELIA

Oh, I am sorry.

AMANDA

No, no, I was happy when he left. I was tired of him, you know. It's always much better to find a new boyfriend! Much more exciting!

CELIA

Perhaps you're right. And what about Romeo Valentine? You went out with him, too.

AMANDA

Oh yes, but I left him . Time for a change, I thought!

CELIA

Oh, I see.

AMANDA

And what about you, Celia? Are there any men in your life at the moment?

CELIA

(Looking shyly down at the big expensive ring on her finger ) Well...

AMANDA

Oh, Celia, do tell me!

'Are there any men in your life at the moment?'

CELIA

Well, there is a man in my life, and I'm going to marry him next week!

AMANDA

You're going to marry him! Wonderful! Tell me all about him.

CELIA

He's called Robert. He's very handsome, but very shy. He's coming here soon, to meet me.

AMANDA

His name's Robert? Well, well, well! You know, I met a very handsome man last night, and he was called Robert, too. But he wasn't shy! Not at all! He asked me to call him Bob.

CELIA

My Robert doesn't like the name Bob.

AMANDA

Well, I met this Bob in a café and we had a few drinks. And then we went out to dinner. And then we went dancing. Oh, we had a wonderful time!

CELIA

My Robert doesn't like dancing.

AMANDA

We talked and laughed and danced, and drank and danced and laughed, and then... But what about you and Robert? What do you usually do?

CELIA

Oh well, Robert likes a quiet evening with me at my house. We read, and watch television. Sometimes we go out to the cinema.

AMANDA

Do you? Bob wants to see me again next week. He calls me Mandy. I like that.

CELIA

Robert isn't interested in drinking or dancing or meeting girls. He's a very quiet person.

'Oh, we had a wonderful time!'

AMANDA

Bob isn't quiet. Not at all!

CELIA

I'm his first girlfriend, you see. So this is all new to him. Oh look, here he comes now!

Robert comes in, from behind Amanda. He can't see her face. He kisses Celia.

ROBERT

Hello, Celia, darling!

CELIA

Robert, darling! I'd like you to meet an old school friend. Amanda, this is Robert.

ROBERT

How do you do?

AMANDA

How do you do? (Looking up into his face ) Oh no! It's you! Bob!

ROBERT

(Seeing her face ) Oh no! It's you! Mandy!

CELIA

(Angrily ) Robert!

ROBERT

What can I say? I'm sorry! I'm very, very sorry!

Robert runs off. Celia and Amanda run after him.

AMANDA

Bob! Bob! We must talk about all this! I want to see you again!

CELIA

Robert! Robert! Come back here at once! Are you going to marry me or not?

ROBERT

Help! Help! Help!

The waiter comes in.

WAITER

Would you like to pay now? (He sees them running away. ) Hey, come back!

He runs angrily after them.

阿曼达路经咖啡馆。西莉亚突然看到她，把她叫住。

西莉亚：

阿曼达？是你吗？

阿曼达：

你是？我认识你吗？

西莉亚：

你当然认识。是我呀，西莉亚。我们一起上过学。

阿曼达：

西莉亚！真高兴又见面！

西莉亚：

你现在想起我来了？

阿曼达：

哦，是的，可是你的样子真的变了。

西莉亚：

是不是变老了？

阿曼达：

呃，是的。

西莉亚：

嗯，我确实变老了！你也一样！坐下跟我喝一杯吧。

阿曼达：

好啊，为什么不呢？（她在桌旁坐下。）

西莉亚：

你要点什么？咖啡？

阿曼达：

哦，我要可乐。

西莉亚：

（喊道） 服务生！（服务生来到桌旁。）

服务生：

早上好。您要点什么？

西莉亚：

请给我一杯咖啡，给我朋友一杯可乐。

服务生：

您要不要来块儿三明治或别的什么？味道很好的。

西莉亚：

不，不了，谢谢。只要饮料。

服务生：

好的。（服务生下场。）

阿曼达：

唔，真是不错！我们上次见面是什么时候？大概15年前了，是吧？

西莉亚：

25年前了，阿曼达。

西莉亚：

哦，我不知道。我不怎么喜欢他。倒是罗基·兰博怎么样了？我想你曾经跟他在一起过。

阿曼达：

啊，是的，不过好多年前他就离开我了。

西莉亚：

哦，我真的很遗憾。

阿曼达：

不，不，他离开的时候我很高兴。你要知道，那时候我已经厌倦了他。男朋友新的总比旧的好！要带劲儿得多！

嗯，我在一个咖啡馆里遇到这个鲍勃，一起喝了几杯。然后我们一起出去吃饭，后来我们还去跳舞。哦，我们在一起玩得开心极了！

Fred's Future


INTRODUCTION

Fred Fish isn't happy with his life. He would like to do something more exciting. What's going to happen to him in the future? Perhaps Madame Rosa can tell him. She can read the future in her crystal ball, or in people's hands. Sometimes she can read people's faces, and then she tells them what they want to hear. But sometimes she gets it wrong, and people don't like what she tells them. If they aren't happy, they don't give her any money. And she needs the money.

CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY

Madame Rosa, a woman who can see into the future

Fred Fish, a teacher

PERFORMANCE NOTES

The scene is Madame Rosa's living room, with a table and two chairs. On the table is a big crystal ball. Madame Rosa is sitting at the table, looking into the crystal ball.

You will need a crystal ball and some money.

ROSA

(Looking into her crystal ball ) What's going to happen today? Ah, I can see money! Yes, somebody's going to give me a lot of money! Wonderful! Who can it be?

FRED

(Coming in ) Hello. Are you Madame Rosa?

ROSA

That's right. Do sit down.

Fred sits down at the table.

FRED

Thank you. Er, my name's Fred Fish—

ROSA

Let me see, you're a teacher, you live in London, and you want to know about your future. Right?

FRED

Yes, yes! How do you know all this?

ROSA

(Looking into the crystal ball ) I can see you here.

FRED

Wow! That's interesting! So can you tell me about my future? What's going to happen to me?

ROSA

I can tell you, but remember, nothing is free these days.

FRED

Oh, I know. I brought some money with me.

ROSA

(Smiling ) That's very good! Right, can you give me your hand, please? I'm going to read it. (She takes his hand and looks carefully at it .) I can see love here. Soon you're going to meet a beautiful American girl. You're going to marry her.

FRED

But I've got a very nice girlfriend at the moment! She's Australian!

ROSA

Forget about her! No, you're going to marry the American. I can see it in your hand.

FRED

Can you tell me any more?

ROSA

Yes. Soon you're going to leave London and move to Hollywood, with your American wife.

FRED

Hollywood! Where all the famous people live!

ROSA

That's right. And you're going to stop teaching. You're going to be an actor, and become famous for acting in all the best Hollywood films!

FRED

Wonderful! I'm going to become rich!

ROSA

Well, yes, but things aren't going to be easy for you. Your wife is going to take a lover.

FRED

Oh no! Another famous actor, perhaps?

ROSA

Yes, that's right. And you're going to start drinking, at first in the evening, and then in the daytime.

FRED

Oh dear, that's bad.

ROSA

Yes. And nobody's going to give you any more acting work, because you drink.

FRED

So what happens to me after all this?

ROSA

You kill yourself, I'm sorry to say.

FRED

What? No! I'm not going to kill myself!

ROSA

It's very quick. You shoot yourself one night.

FRED

I didn't come here to hear about dying!

ROSA

It's all in your hand. That's ￡25, please.

FRED

It can't be right! Can you look at my hand again?

ROSA

Oh, all right. (Looking at his hand again ) Let me see – perhaps you marry the Australian girl.

FRED

That's better!

ROSA

Yes, and you leave London to move to Sydney, with your Australian wife.

'I didn't come here to hear about dying!'

FRED

Mmm, yes, it's wonderfully hot there.

ROSA

And you're going to stop teaching, and become a very good tennis player.

FRED

I was very good at tennis at school, you know.

ROSA

You're going to meet all the famous players and play tennis with them. People are going to watch you playing tennis on TV.

FRED

Wow! I'm going to become rich and famous!

ROSA

Yes, but things aren't going to be easy for you. Your wife's going to—

FRED

Be careful!

ROSA

Let me see – er – your hand's difficult to read. Ah yes, your wife's going to have a baby.

FRED

Oh, good. I like children.

ROSA

Yes, and then she's going to have a second baby, and then a third.

FRED

Oh! But I'm never going to see the children! I'm going to be on TV all the time!

ROSA

Things aren't going to be easy. I told you that.

FRED

Perhaps I'm going to stop being a tennis player and be a teacher again. Then I can help my wife with the children in the holidays.

ROSA

Er – that's right. It's all in your hand. You're going to stop playing tennis and begin teaching again.

FRED

But am I going to be happy? That's the most important thing.

ROSA

Oh yes. You're going to be very happy with your family, and you're going to live in a beautiful big house in Sydney.

FRED

I can always play tennis with my friends at the weekend.

ROSA

Yes, of course. So there you are. Now you know about your future. Are you happy with that?

FRED

Yes. Yes, thank you. Very interesting. I'm going to ask my girlfriend to marry me at once!

ROSA

Why not? And move to Australia?

FRED

That's right. And before we go, I'm going to play some tennis. I must get better at it!

ROSA

Right, well, that's ￡30, please.

FRED

Of course. Here you are. (He takes some money from his pocket and gives it to her .) Things are going to be very exciting for me! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

ROSA

(Smiling ) Thank you .

She takes the money and Fred goes out.

You're going to become a very good tennis player.

是的，快请坐。

弗雷德坐到桌旁。

弗雷德：

谢谢。呃，我叫弗雷德·菲什……

罗莎：

让我看看，你是个老师，住在伦敦，想知道你的未来，对不对？

弗雷德：

对，没错！你是怎么知道的？

罗莎：

（看着水晶球） 我能在这里面看到你。

弗雷德：

哇！真有意思！那你能告诉我我的未来吗？我会怎样？

罗莎：

我可以告诉你，不过要知道，如今没有什么是免费的。

弗雷德：

哦，我知道。我带了钱。

罗莎：

（微笑） 那太好了！好了，请把你的手给我，好吗？我要看看你的手。（她握住他的手，仔细地看起来。） 我在这儿看到爱情。很快你就会遇到一个漂亮的美国姑娘。你会跟她结婚。

弗雷德：

可我现在已经有个很好的女朋友了！她是澳大利亚人。

罗莎：

忘了她吧！不，你会跟那个美国姑娘结婚。我在你的手上看到了。

弗雷德：

你能再多告诉我一些事吗？

罗莎：

好。很快你就会离开伦敦，跟你的美国太太搬到好莱坞去。

弗雷德：

好莱坞！那个名人聚居的地方！

罗莎：

对。你以后不会再教书了，你会成为一个演员，出演好莱坞所有顶尖大片，成为大明星！

弗雷德：

太棒了！我会变得很富有！

罗莎：

唔，是的，但是你的生活不会一帆风顺，你的妻子会有情人。

弗雷德：

哦，不！或许是另一个明星？

罗莎：

是的，没错。而你会开始酗酒，开始是在晚上，后来连白天也酗酒。

弗雷德：

哦，天哪，那太糟糕了。

罗莎：

是的。而且因为你酗酒，没人会再找你演出。

弗雷德：

那这以后我会怎么样？

罗莎：

我很遗憾，你会自杀。

弗雷德：

什么？不！我才不会自杀！

罗莎：

事情发生得很快，一天晚上你朝自己开了一枪。

弗雷德：

我来这儿可不是听什么死讯的！

罗莎：

这都写在你的手上。一共25英镑，付钱吧。

弗雷德：

肯定不对！你能再看看我的手吗？

罗莎：

哦，好吧。（又开始看他的手） 让我看看——或许你会娶那个澳大利亚 姑娘。

弗雷德：

还是这样好！

罗莎：

是的，你会跟你的澳大利亚太太离开伦敦，搬到悉尼。

弗雷德：

唔，这样呀，那儿天气热得很。

罗莎：

你不再教书，而是成为了一个很棒的网球运动员。

弗雷德：

你知道吗，我上学的时候，网球打得很好。

罗莎：

你会见到所有的著名球星，跟他们打球。大家会在电视上看你打网球。

弗雷德：

哇！我会名利双收！

罗莎：

是的，但是你的生活不会一帆风顺。你的妻子会——

弗雷德：

看好了再说！

罗莎：

让我看看——呃——你的手相有点复杂。啊，是的，你的妻子会生个孩子。

弗雷德：

哦，好啊。我喜欢孩子。

罗莎：

对，然后她还会生一个，之后又生一个。

弗雷德：

哦！可我根本不会有时间见到这些孩子！我会一直在电视上！

罗莎：

我告诉过你，你的生活不会一帆风顺的。

弗雷德：

或许我不当网球运动员，又重新当老师了。这样我就可以在假期里帮我妻子照顾孩子。

罗莎：

呃——是的。这都写在你的手上。你不再打网球，又开始当老师了。

弗雷德：

可是我会开心吗？那才是最重要的。

罗莎：

哦，会的。你会幸福地跟家人生活在一起，你们一家会住在悉尼一座漂亮的大房子里。

弗雷德：

反正我周末还可以跟朋友们打网球。

罗莎：

对，当然。就是这样了。现在你知道了你的未来，你满意吗？

弗雷德：

满意，满意，谢谢你。真有意思。我要马上去向我的女朋友求婚！

罗莎：

好哇。然后搬到澳大利亚？

弗雷德：

对。我们走之前，我要练习一下网球。我得打得再好一点儿才行！

罗莎：

没错，好了，一共是30英镑，请给钱吧。

弗雷德：

当然，给你。（他从口袋里掏出钱给她。） 我的生活会变得很精彩！谢谢，谢谢，太谢谢了！

罗莎：

（微笑） 是我谢你才对。

她接过钱，弗雷德离开了。

MRS BOGGIS

Ooh, that's nice!

MR BOGGIS

Yes. Very hot, Florida.

MRS BOGGIS

Yes, and very exciting.

MR BOGGIS

How much is the Florida holiday?

Er, let me see. ￡2,000 for one person...

MR BOGGIS

￡2,000 for one person!

'Ooh, that's nice!'

AGENT

...for one day.

MR BOGGIS

For one day!

MRS BOGGIS

Oh dear. That's ￡28,000 for the two of us for a week. That's very expensive.

AGENT

You can't have everything. It's a very nice holiday. But let's find something cheaper, shall we?

MR BOGGIS

Er, yes, please.

AGENT

What about this? A camping holiday for two near the Scott Hills.

MRS BOGGIS

Ooh, that's interesting. I like camping. Are they far away, the Scott Hills?

AGENT

Oh, yes, very far away.

MR BOGGIS

Good. And is it a cheap holiday?

AGENT

Oh, yes. Only ￡20 for each person for a month.

MRS BOGGIS

And is it nice and hot there?

AGENT

Well, not very hot.

MRS BOGGIS

Tell me, where are the Scott Hills?

AGENT

In Antarctica, near the South Pole.

MR BOGGIS

Near the South Pole! But that isn't hot.

OK. Well, this one's just right for you.

MRS BOGGIS

Is it cheap?

AGENT

Oh, yes. It's cheap. Only ￡200 for two people. That's very cheap.

MR BOGGIS

Is it somewhere hot?

AGENT

Oh, yes. It's hot. But it isn't very far away, I'm afraid.

MRS BOGGIS

Oh, that doesn't matter. Where is it?

AGENT

Margarita, in the south of Spain. The Hotel Fantastico is very quiet, only five minutes' walk to the sea, and it has a swimming pool.

MRS BOGGIS

Ooh, that's wonderful. Let's take it.

MR BOGGIS

Yes, let's! Can I pay for it now? And can we go tomorrow?

AGENT

Of course. (She takes Mr Boggis's money and gives him two tickets .) Here are your tickets. Have a nice holiday! Goodbye!

MR AND MRS BOGGIS

Thank you. Goodbye!

Mr and Mrs Boggis go out with their tickets. A man comes in and speaks to the audience.

MAN

So, Mr and Mrs Boggis are going to have a wonderful holiday, are they? What do you think? Let's see, shall we? It's now two weeks later.

He goes off. Mr and Mrs Boggis come into the travel agent's office.

AGENT

Good morning. Can I help you?

MR BOGGIS

We're very angry about one of your holidays. To Margarita, it was.

AGENT

Ah, yes. Cheap, hot, and not very far away.

'We're very angry about one of your holidays.'

MR BOGGIS

Well, Margarita was OK, but the hotel was no good at all. It was quiet, you said.

AGENT

Well, I did say that, yes.

MRS BOGGIS

Well, the building was only half finished, so there were men at work day and night! There was a lot of noise.

MR BOGGIS

We couldn't sleep at all.

MRS BOGGIS

And it had a swimming pool, you said.

AGENT

Well, er, yes, perhaps I did say that.

MR BOGGIS

That was half finished, too. No water in it.

AGENT

I see. Well—

MRS BOGGIS

Five minutes' walk to the sea, you said.

MR BOGGIS

Perhaps it takes five minutes in a taxi. Not on foot, oh no!

AGENT

Oh dear. Well, I'm very sorry. Perhaps you'd like some of your money back?

MRS BOGGIS

No, we'd like another holiday now.

AGENT

Oh, yes, why not? How about two plane tickets to Australia? It's exciting, hot and very far away!

MRS BOGGIS

Ooh, wonderful! Let's take them.

AGENT

Here are your tickets, then. Have a nice holiday!

They go out happily with their tickets.

AGENT

(Smiling ) The tickets are only to Australia! Perhaps they're never going to come back!

Eight photos?

WOMAN

Yes, four of you and four of the monkey.

MAN

Yes, I have. (He gives her some photos .)

WOMAN

Good. (Looking at the photos carefully ) Wait a minute. These are very bad photos of you.

Ah, yes. Excuse me, I must make a quick phone call.(Telephoning ) Hello, Tom. Pam here again. No, at the office. Shall we go to the cinema tonight? OK, I can get the tickets when I leave work. Goodbye, darling!(To the man ) Right, now where were we?

MAN

I'm waiting for a PM624.

WOMAN

Ah, I see.

MAN

Well, can I have one?

WOMAN

Let me see, what day is it today?

MAN

Tuesday. Why?

WOMAN

Well, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays you get PM624s from this office, but on Tuesdays and Thursdays you get them from Room 563.

MAN

Room 563! Where's that?

WOMAN

Oh, it's easy to find. Go out of the door. (The man goes out. ) Go upstairs.

MAN

(Calling from offstage ) OK! What next?

WOMAN

(Taking down sign saying ROOM 365) Go left, left and left again.

MAN

(Calling from offstage ) Right!

WOMAN

Not right! Left, left and left again! Now come downstairs and it's the office on your right. (She puts up a sign saying ROOM 563 on the wall .)

MAN

(Coming in ) Hello. Oh, it's you.

WOMAN

Hello, this is Room 563. Can I help you?

No, it's Room 563. Look, it says ROOM 563 on the wall. Can I help you?

MAN

I'd like a PM624, please.

WOMAN

Good, good. Do sit down.

MAN

(Sitting down ) But I don't understand!

WOMAN

Well, you see, I'm doing the work of two people. I work in Room 365 and Room 563. So I put the two rooms together. It's easier for me.

MAN

Oh, I see. Well, can I have a PM624, please?

WOMAN

Excuse me a minute. (Telephoning ) Hello, Tom, Pam again. Yes, I'm going to be home soon. OK. See you soon. Goodbye, darling!

MAN

Can I have my PM624 now, please?

WOMAN

Let me see. It's for this monkey, is it?

MAN

Yes, that's right.

WOMAN

Is it a working monkey?

MAN

It doesn't do any work, no. It lives in my house.

WOMAN

That's OK then, because for a working monkey the PM624 is no good at all.

MAN

(Angrily ) Now look, are you going to give me that PM624 or not? I arrived here half an hour ago. First you told me to get a ticket, no, two tickets.

WOMAN

Everybody needs a ticket. That's the rule.

MAN

(More angrily ) Then you asked for eight photos. Then you told me to leave the room and come back again.

WOMAN

To a different room. Room 563.

MAN

Now you're asking, is it a working monkey? And all the time you phone your friend Tom and talk about dinner and the cinema and...

He begins to cry.

WOMAN

I don't make the rules. I only work here, you know.

MAN

(Feeling better ) Yes, I know. I'm sorry. Can I have the PM624 now, please?

WOMAN

Wait a minute. What's the time?

MAN

(Looking at his watch ) One minute past five. Why?

WOMAN

Oh dear! This office closes at five. Can you come back tomorrow?

MAN

Aaaaargh! (He runs off, crying. )

'Can I have the PM624 now, please?'

女人：

你进来之前，可以在门外取一个号。你有号吗？

男人：

（四下看看） 可是这儿没人啊。只有我！所以我用不着取号，不是吗？

女人：

那不重要，任何人都得取号。（她又埋头写起来。）

男人：

男人走到桌旁，坐在女人对面。

女人：

男人：

这是365室吧？

男人：

稍等。（他跑出去给猴子取了一个号返回。） 给你。

女人：

好的。现在请把你的PM624给我。

男人：

抱歉，那是什么？

女人：

PM624吗？你要在PM624表格上回答很多关于你自己和你的猴子的问题，这个很重要。

男人：

好吧，那你能给我一张表格吗？

女人：

不行，抱歉我给不了。

男人：

好吧，那我到哪儿能弄一张？

女人：

稍等，我得打个电话。（打电话） 喂，汤姆，又是我，帕姆。不是，我在上班。你来的时候能带瓶酒吗？好的，再见，亲爱的！（对男人） 好了，我们说到哪儿了？

女人：

对，四张你的，四张猴子的。

男人：

我带了。（他递给女办事员几张照片。）

女人：

好。（仔细地看照片） 等一下。你的这几张照片拍得很糟糕。

男人：

（看了看照片，笑起来） 不是，不是！那几张照片是猴子的！另外几张才是我的！

女人：

啊，对。不好意思，我得打个电话，很快就好。（打电话） 喂，汤姆，还是我，帕姆。不是，在办公室。我们今晚要不要去看电影？好的，我下班后去买票。再见，亲爱的！（对男人） 好了，我们说到哪儿了？

男人：

我在等着要一张PM624表格。

女人：

啊，我知道了。

男人：

那么，能给我一张吗？

女人：

让我看看，今天星期几？

男人：

星期二。为什么问这个？

女人：

嗯，星期一、星期三和星期五，你可以从这个办公室领PM624表格，但是星期二和星期四，你要从563室领表格。

男人：

563室！那个房间在哪儿？

女人：

哦，很容易找。从这个门出去。（男人走了出去。） 上楼。

男人：

（声音从台下传来） 好的！然后呢？

女人：

（把写着“365室”的牌子摘下来） 左转，左转，再左转。

男人：

（声音从台下传来） 好的！

女人：

不是右转！左转，左转，再左转！现在下楼，就是你右手边的办公室。（她把写着“563室”的牌子挂到墙上。）

男人：

（走进来） 你好。哦，是你。

女人：

你好，这里是563室。有什么事情吗？

男人：

可我刚才就在这个房间，这是365室。

女人：

不是，这是563室。看，墙上写着“563室”。有什么事情吗？

男人：

请给我一张PM624表格。

女人：

好的，好的。请坐。

男人：

（坐下） 可是我不明白！

女人：

好吧，你看到了，我在做两个人的工作。我在365室和563室办公，所以我把这两个房间合并了。这样我比较方便。

男人：

哦，我明白了。好吧，能给我一张PM624表格吗？

女人：

请稍等。（打电话） 喂，汤姆，还是我，帕姆。对，我很快就要回家了。好，一会儿见。再见，亲爱的！

男人：

现在能给我PM624表格吗？

女人：

让我看看。是给这只猴子的，对吗？

男人：

对，没错。

女人：

是只要工作的猴子吗？

男人：

不是，它不工作。它住在我家里。

女人：

那就好，因为PM624表格对要工作的猴子无效。

男人：

（生气地） 行了，你到底给不给我PM624表格？我半个小时之前就来了。你先是叫我去取一个号，不对，是两个号。

女人：

谁都得有号。这是规定。

男人：

（愈发生气） 接着你又要八张照片。然后你又让我从这个房间出去又回来。

女人：

是让你去另一个房间，563室。

男人：

现在你又问这是不是一只有工作的猴子？这同时你一直在给你的朋友汤姆打电话，聊吃饭、看电影，还有……

他哭了起来。

女人：

规定不是我定的。你知道，我只是在这里工作。

男人：

（感觉好一些） 是的，我知道。对不起，现在能给我PM624表格了吗？

女人：

稍等，现在几点了？

男人：

（看了看表） 五点过一分。怎么了？

女人：

哦，天哪！这间办公室五点关门，你能明天再来吗？

男人：

啊——！（他哭着跑了出去。）

INTRODUCTION

Gwen is Roger's girlfriend. She first met him ten years ago, and they go out together two or three times a week. Now she would like to marry him, but he never talks about marrying.

You will need some cigarettes, a cup of coffee and a ring.

Gwen is looking at herself in the mirror.

GWEN

(To herself ) Mmm, you look beautiful! But what does Roger think? (To the audience ) Roger's my boyfriend, you see. He's very shy, you know, and very poor. But perhaps tonight he's going to ask me to marry him. He's coming here to dinner at my sister's house. Nice, isn't it?

She looks around her, smiling. The door opens.

Ah, here he is!

Roger comes in.

ROGER

Gwen, my love.

(Smiling at him ) Yes, Roger?

ROGER

You know, we first met a long time ago.

GWEN

Yes.

ROGER

Nine years ago, I think.

GWEN

Ten!

ROGER

Sorry, of course it's ten. (To the audience ) This isn't easy. She's very rich and I'm very poor. (To Gwen ) Well, after ten years, it's time...

GWEN

(Looking interested ) Yes?

ROGER

It's time...

GWEN

Yes?

To have a cigarette, I think. Have you got one, Gwen?

Here you are, darling.

ROGER

(Looking at her watch and speaking to the audience ) What a beautiful gold watch!

GWEN

What did you say, darling?

ROGER

Oh, it's your hands, darling. They're wonderfully, wonderfully beautiful!

GWEN

(To the audience ) What's new about my hands? (To Roger ) Oh Roger, you say the nicest things!

ROGER

And your mouth, Gwen...

GWEN

(Coming nearer ) Yes, Roger?

ROGER

It's a beautiful flower – Oh! (He moves quickly away, and Gwen puts her hand over her mouth. )

GWEN

(To the audience ) I had some garlic for lunch! Roger, you're very handsome, you know.

ROGER

(Shyly ) Oh, am I, Gwen?

GWEN

Oh yes. Your ears! I love your ears! They're very – interesting. (To the audience ) And very big.

ROGER

Oh Gwen!

'Oh Roger, you say the nicest things!'

GWEN

Your eyes! I love your eyes! They're very – blue. (To the audience ) And very cold.

ROGER

Oh my love!

GWEN

And your hair! I love your hair! It's very – brown. (To the audience ) There isn't much there.

ROGER

Oh darling! Well, after that I must say...

GWEN

Yes, Roger?

ROGER

I need a coffee. Could you get me one, Gwen?

GWEN

Of course, darling. (She goes out .)

ROGER

(To the audience ) I don't like milk in my coffee. Is she going to remember?

Gwen comes back and gives a cup of coffee to Roger.

GWEN

I put some milk in it, darling. Is that all right?

ROGER

Mmm, wonderful, darling. Just like you!

GWEN

(Smiling shyly ) Oh Roger!

ROGER

Well, darling, it was eleven years ago...

GWEN

Ten!

ROGER

Of course. Ten. Ten. Sorry! So it's about time...

GWEN

Yes, darling?

ROGER

It's about time...

GWEN

Yes, darling?

ROGER

To bring you a little something.

He takes a ring from his pocket.

GWEN

Oh Roger, a ring! How beautiful!

'Oh Roger, a ring! How beautiful!'

ROGER

Do you like it? (To the audience ) It was very expensive!

GWEN

Of course, darling. (To the audience ) Oh dear, it looks so cheap. (To Roger ). Roger, how exciting! Are you asking me...?

ROGER

Yes. (Taking her hand ) Marry me, darling!

GWEN

Er, well, now you ask me, I don't know.

ROGER

You don't know?

GWEN

Well, this is all very sudden, Roger. I need some more time to think about it.

ROGER

(To the audience ) Oh no! That's bad! I need her money. (To Gwen ) How much time do you need?

GWEN

Well, I can give you an answer next week.

ROGER

But next week I'm going to New York!

GWEN

New York! How exciting!

ROGER

It's only for work, you know. (To the audience ) Of course, Susie's going to be there! I always see her when I go to New York! (To Gwen ) Oh Gwen! Please give me an answer before I leave!

GWEN

You see, Roger, you need to change a lot, before I can marry you.

ROGER

Change? Me? Change? But how?

GWEN

Well, to begin with, you must stop smoking!

ROGER

(Looking at his cigarette ) Stop smoking?

GWEN

And you must stop drinking coffee!

ROGER

(Looking at his coffee ) Stop drinking coffee?

GWEN

And you must stop going to New York, too!

ROGER

Stop going to New York? (To the audience ) Does she know about Susie? Oh dear!

GWEN

So, Roger, what do you think? Can you change?

ROGER

What can I say, Gwen? I need you. (To the audience ) And I need her money! (To Gwen ) I'm going to stop smoking. And drinking coffee. And going to New York. (To the audience ) Sorry, Susie!

GWEN

All right, Roger. I can give you my answer here and now. My answer is yes!

ROGER

Oh Gwen, darling!

GWEN

Oh Roger! (They kiss .)

ROGER

(To the audience ) Now I needn't think about money any more! I'm going to have lots of money, my darling wife's money! (Laughing )

GWEN

(To the audience ) Roger doesn't know this, but I'm not rich at all! I like expensive things, but I haven't got much money. When I tell him, what's he going to say?(Laughing )

They go out, hand in hand and smiling happily at each other.

格温：

什么，罗杰？

罗杰：

我想喝杯咖啡。你能给我倒杯咖啡吗，格温？

格温：

当然，亲爱的。（她走了出去。）

罗杰：

（对观众） 我不喜欢在咖啡里加奶。她会记得吗？

格温回来，端给罗杰一杯咖啡。

格温：

我在里面加了些奶，亲爱的。这样行吗？

罗杰：

唔，好极了，亲爱的。就像你一样！

是时候……

格温：

什么，亲爱的？

罗杰：

给你一个小东西了。

他从口袋里掏出一枚戒指。

格温：

哦，罗杰，一枚戒指！太漂亮了！

罗杰：

你喜欢吗？（对观众） 这个贵得要死！

格温：

当然，亲爱的。（对观众） 哦，天哪，看起来多么廉价。（对罗杰） 罗杰，真让人激动！你是要让我……？

罗杰：

是的。（握住她的手） 嫁给我，亲爱的！

格温：

呃，嗯，现在你向我求婚，我不知道。

罗杰：

你不知道？

格温：

唔，这太突然了，罗杰。我需要一些时间考虑一下。

罗杰：

（对观众） 哦，不！这下糟了！我需要她的钱。（对格温） 你需要多长时间？

格温：

唔，我下个星期答复你。

罗杰：

可是下个星期我要去纽约！

格温：

纽约！多棒啊！

罗杰：

你知道，只是去出差。（对观众） 当然，苏茜会在那儿！我去纽约的时候总是去看她！（对格温） 哦，格温！请在我走之前答复我！

格温：

你看，罗杰，你得做很多改变，我才能嫁给你。

罗杰：

改变？我？改变？可是怎么改？

格温：

唔，首先，你必须戒烟！

罗杰：

（看着他的香烟） 戒烟？

格温：

而且你必须戒掉咖啡！

罗杰：

（看着他的咖啡） 戒掉咖啡？

格温：

而且你也不能再去纽约！

罗杰：

不能再去纽约？（对观众） 她知道苏茜的事了吗？哦，老天！

格温：

那么，罗杰，你觉得怎么样？你能改变吗？

罗杰：

我能说什么呢，格温？我需要你。（对观众） 而且我需要她的钱！（对格温） 我会戒烟，戒掉咖啡，也不再去纽约了。（对观众） 抱歉，苏茜！

格温：

好吧，罗杰。我现在就能在这里答复你：我愿意！

罗杰：

哦，格温，亲爱的！

格温：

哦，罗杰！（他们接吻。）

罗杰：

（对观众） 现在我再也不用想钱的事了！我会有很多钱，我亲爱的妻子的钱！（大笑）

格温：

（对观众） 罗杰不知道，我根本不富有！我喜欢昂贵的东西，但是没有多少钱。等我告诉他时，他会说什么呢？（大笑）

他们开心地相视而笑，手拉手走了出去。

内容简介


知道应该做什么事并不总是那么容易的。对这五个短剧里的人们来说，生活可能很艰难，偶尔还非常可笑。

哈里和他的朋友感觉厌烦透顶，因为他们身无分文。但是哈里有个计划可以改变这一切。这是一个不错的计划，但即便是最棒的计划也可能出严重的错误……

“听着，”罗恩说，“我那边的朋友有枪。把钱给我！现在就给我！”

“什么钱？”那个女人回答，“我很抱歉，这里不是银行，这里是图书馆。”

锡德和罗恩必须偷点什么东西，但要抢图书馆并不容易。那个女人高兴地把借书卡给了他们，这样他们可以借书，而不是偷书。事实上，她很乐意帮忙……

事情往往比表面上看起来要困难。但就像这些短剧中那样，当人们试图做正确的事情时，他们往往更有意思，也更加好笑。





FIVE SHORT PLAYS


It's not always easy to know the right thing to do. For the people in these five short plays, life can be difficult and sometimes very funny.

Harry and his friends are fed up because they haven't got any money. But Harry has a plan to change all this. It's a good plan, but even the best plans can go badly wrong...

'Listen,' says Ron, 'My friend over there has got a gun. Give me the money! Give it to me now!'

'What money?' the woman answers. 'I'm sorry, this is not a bank. This is a library.'

Sid and Ron must steal something, but it isn't easy to rob a library. The woman happily gives them library cards so they can borrow books, and not steal them. In fact, she's very pleased to help...

Things are often more difficult than they seem. But as in all these plays, people are often more interesting, and much funnier, when they're trying to do the right thing.

SCENE 1

The plan

Harry comes into the room. His friends look up at him.

HARRY

Hello, everyone. What are you doing?

SID

Nothing, Harry, nothing! What can we do? We haven't got any money.

HARRY

I know, I know. But it's OK. I have some work for us. We can make a lot of money.

WILF

Work? But you don't like work, Harry.

HARRY

Ah, but this work is different.

GLADYS

How, Harry? What are we going to do?

HARRY

We're going to rob a bank.

GLADYS

Rob a bank? But how can we?

HARRY

I have a plan, a very good plan.

'I have a plan, a very good plan.'

WILF

Which bank are we going to rob?

HARRY

The Capital Bank.

WILF

Which one is that?

HARRY

The one next to the library in the High Street.

SID

That's a very big bank!

HARRY

Be quiet and listen. Now, I want Wilf to drive the car, and Gladys to stand outside the bank and watch the street.

WILF AND GLADYS

OK, Harry.

HARRY

Sid—

SID

(Excitedly ) Yes, Harry? What do you want me to do?

HARRY

You must go into the bank and speak to everyone there. Say to them, 'Stay there! Don't move! I've got a gun in my pocket.'

SID

But Harry, we haven't got a gun.

HARRY

I know that! You just put your hand in your pocket like this. Move your hand up and down in your pocket and say, 'This is a gun!'

SID

I understand.

HARRY

Good. Now, Ron, I want you to go with Sid—

RON

Yes, Harry, and then what?

HARRY

Go to one of the bank workers and say, 'My friend has a gun. Give me the money!'

GLADYS

What are you going to do, Harry?

HARRY

I'm going to wait in the car with Wilf. Do you have any questions?

ALL

No.

HARRY

OK. So let's look at the plan again...

SCENE 2

The robbery

Sid and Ron run into the library. The people there look up from their books.

SID

Listen to me, all of you. This is a robbery. Don't move. I've got a gun in my pocket.

PEOPLE

Oh, don't shoot! Please don't shoot! We don't want to die.

SID

Nobody's going to die, but you must do what I say. (To Ron ) Go on, Ron. What are you waiting for? Get the money! Quick!

Ron goes over to the woman who works there.

RON

Listen, my friend over there has got a gun. Give me the money! Give it to me now!

WOMAN

What money?

RON

What do you mean, 'What money?' The money in this bank, of course!

WOMAN

I'm sorry, this is not a bank. This is a library.

RON

What did you say – a library?

WOMAN

That's right. People come here to borrow books. We don't have any money here.

RON

Er, you don't have any money... Oh dear!... Sid! Sid!

SID

What? Have you got the money?

RON

There isn't any money. It's not a bank, Sid. We're not in a bank. This is a library!

SID

A library?

RON

That's right. They've only got books – lots and lots of books!

SID

Books? Well, get some of those, then. We must take something, or Harry's going to be angry.

RON

(To the woman ) Give me lots of books!

WOMAN

Have you got a library card?

'Have you got a library card?'

RON

A card? No, I haven't.

WOMAN

I'm sorry, you can't borrow books without a library card.

RON

Look, you don't understand, we're not borrowing books, we're stealing them!

WOMAN

I'm sorry, but you can't do that.

RON

Sid, we can't steal books, she says.

SID

I've got a gun. Tell her that!

RON

My friend's got a gun and he knows how to shoot!

WOMAN

Look, it's not a problem. I can give you and your friend a library card. Then you can borrow the books and not steal them. What are your names?

RON

Oh, all right. I'm Ronald Savage, and he's Sidney Dupree.

WOMAN

(Writing ) Ronald Savage... Sidney Dupree. And what's your address?

RON

27 Dunfore Road, Hamley.

WOMAN

(Writing ) 27 Dunfore Road, Hamley. Good, here you are. (She gives Ron two library cards. ) Now you can borrow some books.

RON

But I don't know anything about reading. You must help me. Which books are best?

SID

Quick, Ron! I can't stand here much longer.

WOMAN

Here are some good books for you. (She takes three books from the shelves. ) The Great Train Robbery, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, and The Adventures of Robin Hood . They're all very famous books.

RON

Oh, that's nice. They look interesting. Thanks.

SID

Ron, come on! Quick!

RON

It's OK, Sid, I've got the books.

SID

All right. (To the people in the library ) We're going now, but don't move. Don't move or talk for five minutes.

PERSON 1

Can we read?

SID

Er, all right. But you must read quietly , OK?

RON

Come on, Sid! Let's go. Harry and the others are waiting.

WOMAN

Goodbye, and happy reading!

RON

Oh yes, thank you. All right, Sid. I'm coming.

They run out of the library.

PERSON 2

Oh dear! I was so afraid!

WOMAN

Oh, they weren't so bad. The one called Sid – he didn't really have a gun, you know.

PERSON 3

Perhaps. But they were robbers. They wanted to rob the bank!

WOMAN

(Laughing ) Yes, but they came into the wrong building!

PERSON 1

Why do you look so pleased?

WOMAN

Well, it's important for everybody to read books – not just you and me, but everybody ... even bank robbers!

PERSON 2

But you aren't going to get those books back, are you?

WOMAN

Oh yes, I am. Remember, I've got their names and their address!

'Remember, I've got their names and their address!'

他们跑出图书馆。

读者乙：

天哪，吓死我了！

女馆员：

读者丙：

也许吧。可他们是抢劫犯，他们想抢劫银行！

女馆员：

（笑起来 ）是啊，不过他们进错了地方！

读者甲：

为什么你看起来很高兴的样子？

女馆员：

嗯，读书对每个人来说都很重要——不仅仅是你和我，而是每一个人 ……甚至是银行抢劫犯！

读者乙：

PERFORMANCE NOTES

For this play you will need a small bottle of pills, a glass of water, blue clothes for the woman, a white coat for the doctor, and perhaps special clothes for the nurse.

A man is lying in the street. Rebecca is walking past. She stops and looks at him, then she looks around her – there is nobody there. She starts to walk away, stops, and goes back to look at the man again. Patrick walks past and stops to look at the man.

PATRICK

What's the matter with him?

REBECCA

I don't know.

PATRICK

Is he dead?

'Is he dead?'

REBECCA

No, he's alive, I think.

PATRICK

Are you going to help him?

REBECCA

Me? Why me?

PATRICK

You were here first.

REBECCA

Yes, I was, but—

David comes in.

DAVID

What's the matter with him?

PATRICK

We don't know.

DAVID

He looks ill.

REBECCA

His eyes are closed. Look!

DAVID

Perhaps he's asleep.

REBECCA

Asleep? In the street?

PATRICK

Wake him up then.

DAVID

Why me? You do it.

PATRICK

(To Rebecca ) What about you?

REBECCA

Me?

PATRICK

Yes. You were here first.

REBECCA

Yes, but it's not my problem.

DAVID

And it's not my problem!

A woman in blue comes in. She kneels down at once to help the man.

REBECCA

Hey, what are you doing?

WOMAN

I'm helping this man, of course!

DAVID

Are you a doctor?

WOMAN

No, I'm not, but he needs help.

REBECCA

Do you know him?

WOMAN

No, I don't.

REBECCA

Then he's not your problem.

WOMAN

Oh, be quiet!

REBECCA

(To the others ) Did you hear that? She said, 'Be quiet!'

WOMAN

Be quiet and help.

REBECCA

She said it again!

WOMAN

(To David ) Go and call an ambulance.

'Go and call an ambulance.'

DAVID

Me?

WOMAN

Yes, you. And be quick.

DAVID

But—

WOMAN

Be quick! (David goes away. ) Now you – (turning to

Rebecca ) go and get some water.

REBECCA

Where from?

WOMAN

From that house over there. Don't look at me like that. Go!

REBECCA

I'm going. (Rebecca goes away. )

WOMAN

(To Patrick ) Feel his pulse.

PATRICK

But I—

WOMAN

Go on! Feel his pulse.

PATRICK

(Kneeling down and taking the man's pulse ) Well, he's still alive. He's saying something!

WOMAN

What is he saying?

PATRICK

He said, 'Pills,' I think.

WOMAN

(To Patrick ) Pills? Look in his pocket.

PATRICK

I can't do that!

WOMAN

Look in his pocket!

Patrick looks in the man's coat pocket.

PATRICK

There's a bottle with some writing on it.

WOMAN

What does it say? Read it!

PATRICK

It says, 'For the heart. If you feel ill, take one of these pills.'

Rebecca comes back with a glass of water.

REBECCA

I've got the water.

WOMAN

Good. (To Patrick ) Give him one of the pills with some water.

Patrick helps the man to sit up. He gives him a pill and some water.

MAN

(Very quietly ) Thank you, thank you!

PATRICK

How do you feel?

MAN

A little better now.

The woman in blue goes away. The others do not see this. David comes running back.

DAVID

The ambulance is coming.

PATRICK

Good.

DAVID

How is he?

REBECCA

He's feeling a little better.

A doctor and a nurse come in. Patrick stands up.

DOCTOR

(Kneeling down by the man ) What's the matter?

'What's the matter?'

MAN

I was ill. It was my heart. That man gave me one of my pills. I'm all right now.

The doctor and the nurse help him to stand up.

NURSE

What's your name?

MAN

Scott. Michael Scott.

DOCTOR

Michael Scott, the famous TV chef?

MAN

Yes, that's right.

NURSE

Come with us, Mr Scott. We'd like to take you to hospital.

MAN

But I feel better now.

NURSE

Perhaps, but you must go to hospital.

MAN

All right. (Turning to the others ) Well, thank you very much, everybody.

DAVID

That's all right.

REBECCA

We're happy to help.

PATRICK

Get well soon.

MAN

Thank you again. Goodbye!

The doctor and the nurse help Scott to walk away.

REBECCA

He's alive, and he's going to be OK.

PATRICK

He's alive because we were here.

DAVID

Michael Scott—

REBECCA

The famous TV chef!

PATRICK

We can all feel very pleased, I think.

REBECCA

Oh yes, we can.

DAVID

What about the woman?

REBECCA

Which woman?

DAVID

The woman who helped. Where is she?

PATRICK

Oh, her ! I remember. She didn't help us .

DAVID

'Do this, do that,' she said. 'Be quick!'

REBECCA

She said, 'Be quiet,' to me.

PATRICK

That's right. I didn't like her. Did you?

REBECCA

No, I didn't. Where is she now?

PATRICK

She walked away.

DAVID

That's right – she just walked away. She didn't want to help.

REBECCA

We did everything.

DAVID

Yeah. Everything.

PATRICK

Today was an important day for us.

DAVID

It was. We helped someone famous.

REBECCA

Because of us he didn't die.

DAVID

We were there for him.

PATRICK

It was the right thing to do.

REBECCA

Yes, it was. Well done, everybody!

DAVID

(To Rebecca ) And well done to you—

PATRICK

Well done to all of us!

演这部剧，你将需要一小瓶药丸、一杯水、蓝色女装、一件医生穿的白大褂，也许还要护士制服。

一个男人躺在大街上。丽贝卡走过时，停下脚步看看他，又环顾四周——周围一个人都没有。她准备走开，却又停下脚步，转回来再次看着那个男人。帕特里克走过时，也停下脚步看着那个男人。

帕特里克：

他怎么了？

丽贝卡：

我不知道。

帕特里克：

他死了吗？

丽贝卡：

不，我想他还活着。

帕特里克：

你打算帮他吗？

丽贝卡：

我？为什么是我？

帕特里克：

你先到这儿的。

丽贝卡：

是我先到的，不过——

戴维走过来。

戴维：

他怎么了？

帕特里克：

我们不知道。

戴维：

他看上去像是不舒服。

丽贝卡：

他的眼睛是闭着的。瞧！

戴维：

也许他是睡着了。

丽贝卡：

睡着了？在大街上？

帕特里克：

那把他叫醒吧。

戴维：

为什么是我？你来把他叫醒。

帕特里克：

（对丽贝卡 ）你来怎么样？

丽贝卡：

我？

帕特里克：

是呀。你先到这儿的。

丽贝卡：

你说得没错，不过这不是我的问题。

戴维：

这也不是我的问题！

一个蓝衣女人走过来。她立刻跪下来帮助那个男人。

丽贝卡：

嘿，你在干什么？

蓝衣女人：

我当然是在帮助这个人！

戴维：

你是医生吗？

蓝衣女人：

不，我不是，但他需要帮助。

丽贝卡：

你认识他吗？

蓝衣女人：

不，我不认识他。

丽贝卡：

那他就不是你的问题。

蓝衣女人：

嘿，安静！

丽贝卡：

（对其他人 ）你们听见了吗？她说“安静！”

蓝衣女人：

安静，过来帮忙。

丽贝卡：

她又说了这话！

蓝衣女人：

（对戴维 ）去叫救护车。

戴维：

我？

蓝衣女人：

是的，就是你。赶快去。

戴维：

可是——

蓝衣女人：

赶快！（戴维离开。 ）现在，你——（转向丽贝卡 ）去弄些水来。

丽贝卡：

到哪里弄？

蓝衣女人：

到那边的那座房子。别那样看着我。快去！

丽贝卡：

我这就去。（丽贝卡离开。 ）

蓝衣女人：

（对帕特里克 ）测他的脉搏。

帕特里克：

可是我——

蓝衣女人：

来呀！测他的脉搏。

帕特里克：

（跪下测那个男人的脉搏 ）哦，他还活着。他在说些什么！

蓝衣女人：

他在说什么？

帕特里克：

我想他说的是“药丸”。

蓝衣女人：

（对帕特里克 ）药丸？看看他的口袋。

帕特里克：

我不能那样做！

蓝衣女人：

看看他的口袋！

帕特里克看了看那个男人的外套口袋。

帕特里克：

里面有个瓶子，上面写了一些字。

蓝衣女人：

写的是什么？念一下！

帕特里克：

上面写着：“适用于心脏问题。如果感觉不适，服用一粒药丸。”

丽贝卡端着一杯水回来。

丽贝卡：

我弄到水了。

蓝衣女人：

好。（对帕特里克 ）用水给他服一粒药丸。

帕特里克扶那个男人坐起来，给他一粒药丸和一些水。

男人：

（声音微弱地 ）谢谢你，谢谢你！

帕特里克：

你感觉怎么样？

男人：

现在好点了。

蓝衣女人离开，但其他人没有看见。戴维跑回来。

戴维：

救护车马上就来。

帕特里克：

那就好。

戴维：

他怎么样？

丽贝卡：

他感觉好点了。

一位医生和一位护士走过来。帕特里克站起来。

医生：

（跪在那个男人身旁 ）怎么回事？

男人：

我觉得不舒服，是心脏的毛病。那个人给我服了一粒我带的药丸。我现在没事了。

医生和护士扶他站起来。

护士：

你叫什么名字？

男人：

斯科特，迈克尔·斯科特。

医生：

迈克尔·斯科特，电视上那位著名的大厨？

男人：

是的，没错。

护士：

跟我们走吧，斯科特先生。我们要送你去医院。

男人：

但我现在感觉好些了。

护士：

可能是这样。不过你还是得上医院。

男人：

好吧。（转向其他人 ）对了，非常感谢各位。

戴维：

别客气。

丽贝卡：

我们很乐意帮忙。

帕特里克：

祝你早日康复。

男人：

再次表示感谢，再见！

医生和护士搀扶斯科特离开。

丽贝卡：

他还活着，他会没事的。

帕特里克：

他还活着，是因为我们刚才在这儿。

戴维：

迈克尔·斯科特——

丽贝卡：

电视上那位著名的大厨！

帕特里克：

我想我们都有资格感到非常高兴。

丽贝卡：

哦，是的，没错。

戴维：

那个女人呢？

丽贝卡：

哪个女人？

戴维：

刚才帮忙的那个女人，她去哪里了？

帕特里克：

哦，她 呀！我记得她。她并没有帮助我们 。

戴维：

“做这个，做那个。”她说，“赶快！”

丽贝卡：

她对我说，“安静。”

帕特里克：

没错。我不喜欢她。你呢？

丽贝卡：

不，我也不喜欢她。她现在去哪里了？

帕特里克：

她走了。

戴维：

没错——她就那样走了。她并不想帮忙。

丽贝卡：

所有的事情都是我们做的。

戴维：

是呀。所有的事情。

帕特里克：

今天对我们来说是重要的一天。

戴维：

是的。我们帮助了一位名人。

丽贝卡：

因为我们他才没有丢掉性命。

戴维：

是我们帮助了他。

帕特里克：

这是应该做的事。

丽贝卡：

对。两位干得漂亮！

INTRODUCTION

This play is about a young person who wants to change his life. Chris would like to see new places and learn new things, but the older people in his life don't like his plan. They can only see problems. Chris finds that he, too, is a little afraid of change.

CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY

Chris, a young person who wants to travel

PERFORMANCE NOTES

At the beginning of the play Chris's friends are in a room. Cox is reading a book, Mills and Harris are talking quietly to each other, and Wright and Dean are looking out of a window.

You will need six chairs, a book, a bag and a map.

Cox, Mills and Harris are sitting in a room. Dean and Wright are standing by a window. Chris comes in.

CHRIS

(Smiling ) Well, goodbye, everyone.

'Well, goodbye, everyone.'

COX

(Putting down his book ) Are you going?

CHRIS

Yes, I must.

MILLS

When are you going?

CHRIS

Now.

COX

Now? So soon?

MILLS

Don't go!

CHRIS

But I must. I need a change.

HARRIS

What are you going to do?

CHRIS

I'd like to travel for a time.

HARRIS

Travel? How wonderful!

DEAN

Yeah, think of us when you're travelling.

COX

Yes, think of us – we have to stay here.

MILLS

It's the same old thing, day after day—

HARRIS

The same old faces.

WRIGHT

The same old problems.

MILLS

Nothing different for us!

DEAN

But someone has to do it.

COX

Yes, that's right. We can't all go!

CHRIS

Why not? You can travel too.

COX

Us? (He laughs. )

MILLS

How can we travel?

HARRIS

We have things to do here.

CHRIS

What things?

WRIGHT

He says, 'What things?'

DEAN

What a question!

COX

(To the others ) He's tired of us.

CHRIS

No, I'm not. I'm not tired of you. I'm happy here.

MILLS

Are you?

CHRIS

Well, I was happy here. It's a good place, and I—

HARRIS

Yes?

CHRIS

Well, I like you. I'm one of you – one of the group.

WRIGHT

That's nice.

DEAN

So where would you like to go?

CHRIS

I don't know. Spain, perhaps, or Greece... maybe even Canada—

'Spain, perhaps, or Greece...'

COX

Canada?

CHRIS

Yes. I'm very interested in Canada.

MILLS

Canada, well!

HARRIS

That's interesting.

WRIGHT

You're very adventurous, Chris.

COX

We're not adventurous at all, I'm afraid.

DEAN

But then you're young—

COX

You have your life in front of you.

MILLS

You want to see exciting places—

HARRIS

Like Canada!

WRIGHT

The lakes and the forests...

'The lakes and the forests...'

COX

The great St. Lawrence River...

DEAN

How wonderful!

COX

Lucky Chris!

MILLS

It's different for us. We have to stay here. We can't go to Canada.

HARRIS

'I'm one of you,' you said, 'one of the group.' But you're not!

DEAN

No, Chris, you're different from us—

CHRIS

No, I'm not! Stop talking like this. I'm not different from you. Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm not. I work and eat and sleep, like you.

MILLS

Ah, but you are going away—

HARRIS

And we are staying here.

WRIGHT

And that makes you different.

CHRIS

I'm not different!

COX

But what about Canada?

CHRIS

Stop talking about Canada! I'm not going to Canada – I'd like to go there, that's all!

COX

So you aren't going there now?

CHRIS

I don't know. Perhaps. I need some time to think about my life.

WRIGHT

Oh, yes.

DEAN

Everyone does.

MILLS

It's usual for people to do that.

HARRIS

And there's lots of time. You're young.

CHRIS

That's right. I have my life in front of me.

HARRIS

So, take your time.

CHRIS

Right.

WRIGHT

You can stay here as long as you like—

DEAN

And think about it.

CHRIS

Yeah. (He sits down. )

ALL

Mmm...

Everyone is quiet for a moment.

COX

So what are you going to do?

CHRIS

Sorry?

MILLS

Are you leaving today?

CHRIS

Leaving? Er, not today. I want to think about it first.

MILLS

Of course.

HARRIS

When are you going, then?

CHRIS

Well, not now. Later, perhaps. I can stay here a bit longer. There's lots of time. (Laughing ) Canada can wait, can't it?

WRIGHT

Yes, it can. It certainly can!

DEAN

You're one of us really, aren't you, one of the group?

CHRIS

Yes, I am, I think.

COX

(Laughing ) But, you know, you say—

CHRIS

Yes? Say what?

COX

Well, you say some funny things sometimes!

CHRIS

Like what?

COX

Well, Canada!

Cox, Mills, Harris, Dean and Wright all laugh.

CHRIS

(Looking at them ) What's so funny about that?

MILLS

(Laughing quietly ) It doesn't matter.

HARRIS

Forget it.

COX

Look at the time – I must go!

MILLS

Me too. I have a lot to do.

HARRIS

And me.

WRIGHT

Let's all go.

DEAN

Yes, let's leave Chris with his dreams—

COX

About Canada !

They all laugh at Chris.

COX

See you later, Chris.

ALL

Bye-bye.

COX

(To Chris ) Bye-bye, traveller!

Chris's friends laugh, and then go out. Chris stands and

watches them go. He doesn't look happy. He opens his bag

and takes out a large map. He opens the map on the floor and

looks at it carefully.

CHRIS

Thailand...Malaysia... Indonesia... Australia... (He looks up, smiling. ) Mmm, Australia!

'Mmm, Australia!'

克里斯的朋友笑着走出房间。克里斯站在那里看着他们离开。他看起来不太高兴。他打开自己的背包，拿出一张大地图。他把地图摊开放在地板上，认真地看起来。

克里斯：

泰国……马来西亚……印度尼西亚……澳大利亚……（他抬起头，露出笑容。 ）嗯，澳大利亚！





Salt


INTRODUCTION

A man goes into a grocery store and buys a lot of salt. At first the other people in the store can't understand why. Then they hear his story, and they all want to buy salt too.

CHARACTERS IN THE PLAY

Shopkeeper, a person who owns a small grocery store

Manra, a truck driver

PERFORMANCE NOTES

Scene 1: In a small grocery store.

Scene 2: In a street, some hours later.

You will need ten bags of salt, and a small cart on wheels. You will need the noise of a truck stopping suddenly, but we do not see the truck.

SCENE 1

No more salt

In a small grocery store, Groot is asking the shopkeeper for something. The others are waiting behind him.

GROOT

I'd like ten bags of salt, please.

SHOPKEEPER

Ten? Of course. That's ten dollars, please.

GROOT

Here you are.

SHOPKEEPER

Can I help you with all that?

GROOT

No, thanks. I have this cart.

SHOPKEEPER

Ten bags. That's a lot of salt.

GROOT

Yes. Salt is very important, you know.

SHOPKEEPER

It is. But why do you need ten bags?

GROOT

Soon there isn't going to be enough salt in the world. I saw it on television.

SHOPKEEPER

Not enough salt? Really?

GROOT

It's true. So I'm buying some now. Goodbye!

He goes out with his cart.

NELLO

Did you hear that?

'Did you hear that?'

DURG

Yeah, there isn't enough salt in the world.

SPRATLY

Not enough salt? That isn't true.

NELLO

But he saw it on television. Soon there isn't going to be any in the stores.

SPRATLY

Really? That's bad – I need salt.

DURG

Me too. I can't live without it!

NELLO

(To the shopkeeper ) Give me some salt, please, ten bags – no, make that twenty bags.

SPRATLY

And me. I'd like thirty bags.

DURG

Me first! I've got a big family. We need salt.

SHOPKEEPER

Be quiet, all of you! You must wait.

NELLO

But we want our salt.

DURG

And we want it now.

SHOPKEEPER

But that man bought my last ten bags.

SPRATLY

Then it's true! He was right – there isn't enough salt in the world. What are we going to do?

SHOPKEEPER

That's your problem. It's six o'clock – time to close the store. I'm going home.

NELLO

But what about our salt?

SHOPKEEPER

Look, there's a lot of salt in the world – enough for everybody. Goodbye!

They all go out.

SCENE 2

We want salt!

Spratly finds Groot standing in a street with his cart.

SPRATLY

Excuse me, I want to buy some salt.

GROOT

Sorry? What did you say?

SPRATLY

I know about the problem.

GROOT

What problem? What are you talking about?

SPRATLY

Soon there isn't going to be enough salt.

GROOT

Oh, you heard about that?

SPRATLY

Yes, and I want some salt.

GROOT

Then go to a grocery store and buy some.

SPRATLY

I can't find any. Every time I ask, the shopkeeper says, 'Sorry, no more salt.'

GROOT

Oh dear!

SPRATLY

But you have some. You bought ten large bags – I saw you.

'But you have some.'

GROOT

I'm sorry, but I'm not selling my salt.

SPRATLY

But I'll give you ten dollars a bag.

GROOT

(Laughing ) No, I want fifty dollars a bag! It's more expensive every day. Soon there isn't going to be enough.

SPRATLY

All right, all right, fifty dollars a bag! Give me five bags. Here's the money.

GROOT

Good man! You're doing the right thing.

Spratly goes out. Durg comes in.

DURG

Excuse me, I saw you buy some salt.

GROOT

Ah!

DURG

What's happening? I can't find any. The shopkeepers all say, 'Sorry. No more salt!'

GROOT

There's a problem.

DURG

I know. It was on television. Everybody is talking about it. Listen, I must have some salt.

GROOT

Sorry, I can't help you.

DURG

But I need it for my family. Please!

GROOT

All right, all right, but it's... er... a hundred dollars a bag.

DURG

Oh no!

GROOT

I told you – everybody wants salt. Well?

DURG

Oh, all right, then. Give me four bags.

GROOT

Four? Good! You understand the world, my friend. I see it in your face.

DURG

Here's the money.

GROOT

And here's your salt! Goodbye.

Durg goes out. Nello comes in.

NELLO

Hey, you, stop!

GROOT

Are you talking to me?

NELLO

Yes, you were in the grocery store—

GROOT

Was I? Perhaps. I go into a lot of grocery stores.

NELLO

You bought all the salt in the store!

GROOT

Well, there's a problem, you know.

NELLO

Yes, there is – and it's all because of you!

GROOT

That's not true!

NELLO

I met Spratly just now. He tried to sell me a bag of salt for five hundred dollars!

GROOT

That's too much.

NELLO

Of course it is – I know your plan! You go from store to store. You buy all the salt, and sell it for a lot more money!

GROOT

OK, it's true – I buy and sell salt – that's not wrong.

NELLO

Then sell some to me.

GROOT

No, I don't want to.

NELLO

(Holding him, angrily ) Listen, I'm going to buy, and you're going to sell. (Shouting ) Do you understand?

GROOT

But I've only got one bag left.

NELLO

(Angrily ) Give it to me, then!

GROOT

It's two hundred dollars. Well, OK, you can have it for a hundred and fifty. But let me go!

NELLO

(Shouting ) Give it to me!

GROOT

No, give me the money first. Now let me go! Oh, help! Help!

Groot runs out. We hear a truck stop suddenly, and Groot cries out. The driver, Manra, comes in, helping Groot to walk.

MANRA

He ran in front of my truck. I didn't see—

'He ran in front of my truck.'

NELLO

You didn't do anything wrong. It was an accident.

MANRA

But why did he run across the street without looking?

NELLO

I was angry with him. So he ran away.

MANRA

(To Groot ) how do you feel?

GROOT

(Holding his leg ) Oh, my leg! My leg hurts. I think it's—

NELLO

He's OK, I think.

MANRA

Wait a minute, what's this in the street?

NELLO

It's salt. He had a bag of salt and I wanted it.

MANRA

Salt? Well, that's interesting! I'm carrying salt on my truck – bags and bags of it!

NELLO

Salt? Oh no! (He laughs. )

MANRA

Why are you laughing?

NELLO

It doesn't matter. I can't tell you now.

MANRA

Then you can tell that policeman. Look, he's coming across the street now. He saw the accident, I think!

小食品杂货店店主

曼拉，卡车司机

场景说明

第一场：在一间小食品杂货店里。

第二场：几个小时之后，在一条大街上。

你将需要十袋盐，一辆小手推车。还需要有卡车急刹车的声音，但观众不会看到卡车。

第一场　没有盐了

在一间小食品杂货店里，格罗特正向店主买什么东西。其他人等在他身后。

格罗特：

请给我十袋盐。

店主：

十袋？当然可以。总共十美元，谢谢。

格罗特：

给您钱。

店主：

需要我帮忙拿吗？

格罗特：

不用了，谢谢。我有这辆手推车。

店主：

十袋。那可是很多盐。

格罗特：

是的。您知道，盐很重要。

店主：

是这样的。但您为什么需要十 袋呢？

格罗特：

世界上的盐很快就会不够用了。这是我在电视上看到的。

店主：

盐不够用？真的吗？

格罗特：

是真的。所以我现在就赶紧买上一些。再见！

他推着手推车下场。

内洛：

你们听见他说的了吗？

杜尔格：

听见了，他说世界上的盐不够用了。

斯普拉特利：

盐不够用？那是瞎说。

内洛：

可这是他在电视上看到的。很快店里就不会再有盐卖了

斯普拉特利：

真的吗？那太糟了——我需要盐。

杜尔格：

我也是。没有盐，我的日子没法过下去！

内洛：

（对店主 ）请给我来些盐，十袋——不，来二十袋。

斯普拉特利：

还有我，我要三十袋。

杜尔格：

先给我！我有一大家子人，我们需要盐。

店主：

大家都安静！你们得等等。

内洛：

可是我们想要盐。

杜尔格：

我们现在就想要。

店主：

可刚才那个男人买走了我最后十袋盐。

斯普拉特利：

那是真的了！他说得对——世界上的盐不够用了。我们该怎么办呢？

店主：

那是你们的 问题。现在六点了——到了店打烊的时间。我要回家了。

内洛：

可我们的盐怎么办？

店主：

听着，世界上的盐多得是——足够每个人吃的。再见！

他们一起下场。

第二场　我们想要盐！

斯普拉特利发现格罗特扶着手推车站在街上。

斯普拉特利：

打扰一下，我想买一些盐。

格罗特：

抱歉，你刚才说什么？

斯普拉特利：

我知道出问题了。

格罗特：

什么问题？你在说什么？

斯普拉特利：

很快盐就会不够用了。

格罗特：

哦，你听说这事了？

斯普拉特利：

是的，所以我想要些盐。

格罗特：

那去食品杂货店买一些呀。

斯普拉特利：

我买不到了。每次我问的时候店主都说，“对不起，没有盐了。”

格罗特：

天哪！

斯普拉特利：

但是你 有盐。你买了十大袋盐——我亲眼看见的。

格罗特：

抱歉，可我不会卖的。

斯普拉特利：

那我每袋给你十美元。

格罗特：

（笑起来 ）不，每袋五十美元我才卖！这东西天天都在涨价。很快就会不够用了。

斯普拉特利：

好吧，好吧，一袋五十美元！给我五袋，这是你的钱。

格罗特：

你真明智！你做得对。

斯普拉特利下场，杜尔格上场。

杜尔格：

打扰一下，我看见你买了一些盐

格罗特：

啊！

杜尔格：

怎么回事？我哪里都买不到盐。店主们都说，“抱歉，没有盐了！”

格罗特：

出问题了。

杜尔格：

我知道。电视上说的。每个人都在谈论这件事。听着，我一定得买到些盐。

格罗特：

抱歉，我帮不了你。

杜尔格：

我的家人需要盐，拜托了！

格罗特：

好吧，好吧，不过这……呃……每袋要一百美元。

杜尔格：

啊，不是吧？

格罗特：

我跟你说过了——每个人都想要盐。你到底要不要？

杜尔格：

哦，那好吧。给我来四袋。

格罗特：

四袋？好的！老兄，你真是通世道。这一点我从你的脸上就能看出来。

杜尔格：

给你钱。

格罗特：

给你盐！再见。

杜尔格下场，内洛上场。

内洛：

嘿，你，站住！

格罗特：

你在和我说话吗？

内洛：

是的，你之前在食品杂货店——

格罗特：

是吗？也许吧。我去过很多食品杂货店。

内洛：

你把店里所有的盐都买走了！

格罗特：

嗯，出问题了，你知道的。

内洛：

是的，是出问题了——不过这一切都是因为你！

格罗特：

你瞎说！

内洛：

我刚才遇到斯普拉特利了。他想以五百美元的价格卖给我一袋盐！

格罗特：

那太贵了。

内洛：

当然贵了——我知道你的打算！你一家店一家店地跑。你把所有的盐都买走，然后再高价卖出去！

格罗特：

好吧，这是事实——我把盐买来又卖掉——可那并没有错。

内洛：

那卖一些给我吧。

格罗特：

不行，我不想卖给你。

内洛：

（抓住他生气地说 ）听着，我就要买，你就得卖。（大声喊道 ）你听明白了吗？

格罗特：

可我只剩一袋了。

内洛：

（生气地说 ）那就把这袋给我！

格罗特：

两百美元。嗯，好吧，可以一百五十美元卖给你。不过你得放开我！

内洛：

（大声喊道 ）把它给我！

格罗特：

不行，先给我钱。现在放开我！哦，救命啊！救命啊！

格罗特跑下场。传来一辆卡车急刹车的声音，接着格罗特大声尖叫。司机曼拉搀扶着格罗特走上场。

曼拉：

他跑到我的卡车前面，我没有看见——

内洛：

你没有做错什么。这是一个意外。

曼拉：

可他跑过大街的时候为什么不看路呢？

内洛：

我在对他发脾气，所以他跑掉了。

曼拉：

（对格罗特 ）你感觉怎么样？

格罗特：

（抱住自己的腿 ）哦，我的腿！我的腿好疼。我想是——

内洛：

他没事，我觉得。

曼拉：

等一下，街上的这个是什么东西？

内洛：

是盐。他有一袋盐，我想买过来。

曼拉：

盐？嗯，真有意思！我卡车上就装着盐呢——整袋整袋的盐！

内洛：

盐？哦，不是吧！（他笑起来。 ）

曼拉：

你为什么笑？

内洛：

没什么，我现在不能告诉你。

曼拉：

那你可以告诉那个警察。瞧，他这会儿正从街对面过来。我想他看到这场事故了！

Well, no, not now. We had one in January, one in February, one in March – one every month for the last year. That makes twelve.

WOMAN 3

Well, where are they now?

MAGGIE

They all stopped working here.

WOMAN 1

Why did they leave?

MAGGIE

Because it was too fast for them.

MAN 2

And how many chefs have you got now?

MAGGIE

Well, er... one.

PEOPLE

One!

MAGGIE

No, sorry. That's wrong—

MAN 1

I'm happy to hear it!

MAGGIE

We haven't got any .

PEOPLE

What?

MAGGIE

That's right. There's only me here. Our last chef left yesterday. He was fed up with fast food.

MAN 2

Fed up?

MAGGIE

Yes. He said to me, 'That's it! Enough! No more fast food for me! I'm going!' And he went.

WOMAN 2

But what about our—

MAGGIE

And do you know? I'm fed up too. Yes, I'm really, really fed up. Fast chicken, fast burgers, fast French fries, fast coke, fast coffee, fast talking, fast walking, fast eating, fast sleeping, fast living, fast dying! I'm fed up with it all!

WOMAN 1

But who is going to—

MAGGIE

What's the matter with everybody these days? Why is everything so fast? Come here. (Maggie walks to the window. ) Come on! (The people all go to the window. ) Look outside. Go on, look! It's a beautiful day. Life is beautiful. We can all be happy. But first we must slow down. We must take the time to live .

'We must take the time to live.'

MAN 1

Live? But we have to work!

WOMAN 3

We have lots to do.

WOMAN 1

And we want food.

MAN 2

We want fast food—

WOMAN 1

Not slow food!

WOMAN 2

We haven't got time to—

MAGGIE

Time! Time! Time! Don't talk to me about time. You don't understand it. You – oh, it's no good, you're not listening to me.

She takes off her work clothes and picks up a bag.

WOMAN 3

Hey, where are you going?

MAGGIE

I'm going out. I'm going to sit in the sun. I'm going to look at the sky and listen to the sea. I'm going to do nothing... slowly !

WOMAN 1

But what about our food?

MAN 2

What about my burger?

MAGGIE

You can do it!

MAN 2

What did you say?

MAGGIE

I said, you can do it. Behind me is the kitchen. In the kitchen there's a big bag of chicken and another bag of burgers. You can do your own food, and you can do it as fast as you like. Goodbye!

PEOPLE

But we don't—

MAGGIE

And have a nice day!

She goes out.

A GHOST IN LOVEAND OTHER PLAYS


AND OTHER PLAYS

Most people do not believe in ghosts, until they see one with their own eyes. In these three plays, Richard, Jenny and Brad all have their lives changed completely by the ghosts who appear to them.

Richard Little is surprised and very afraid when he sees the ghost of his dead brother-in-law. He knows that he must help the ghost to find peace, although he himself will be in great danger.

When Jenny Lawson meets the ghost of her dead husband, she understands that he has a special message for her – something that he did not manage to tell her when he was alive.

And finally, in the title play, Brad Davis meets the ghost of the girl he loved and left three hundred years ago. Is he going to stay with her and make her happy, or return to twentieth-century America?

SCENE 1A ghost comes to Richard Little

A ghost comes to Richard Little

The year is 1653. It is a cold, dark winter night and Richard Little, a man of forty, is sitting in his chair. He is reading a book. He hears something. He goes to the window, looks out and then goes back to the chair. His wife, Mary, comes in. She is making a dress. She has the dress in her hand.

RICHARD

Mary, I can hear something outside.

MARY

There's nothing there. Read your book, Richard.

RICHARD

Come and sit with me.

MARY

No. I'm making a dress. I'm going upstairs.

RICHARD

Mary, please. There's something out there.

MARY

Oh, Richard!

Mary goes out and James Heston's ghost comes in.

HESTON

Hello, Richard.

RICHARD

Aaaagh! You! James! James Heston! But you – you're dead!

HESTON

Yes. I am dead. But I can't find peace because of you.

RICHARD

Because of me? Why – why because of me?

HESTON

Beth had a new husband after me. That animal, Keech.

RICHARD

Yes. Beth was a good woman. And a good sister to me. I said to her, 'Don't go with Keech. Think of James. He's dead now.'

HESTON

She was Keech's wife for only three months. Then she died. And now Keech has my son. And he has my son's money.

RICHARD

Ah. I understand now.

HESTON

Oh, you remember now? Before I died, I said to you, 'My boy gets my money at twenty-one and not before.' He is eight now, Eight. And Keech has his money.

'My boy gets my money at twenty-one and not before.'

RICHARD

I'm sorry about that, but what can I do?

HESTON

You must get my boy's money. Get it from Keech.

RICHARD

No! Keech can kill me with one hand. He's big – he always has a knife in his pocket. Last year he killed a man with that knife. I'm afraid of him, James.

HESTON

Are you afraid of me?

RICHARD

No. Oh! Yes, a little. You're a ghost!

HESTON

Only a little, eh? Look at the table.

RICHARD

(Looking at the table ) Oh no! The table is moving! (He stands up and walks to the table .) Oh no! Oh, the chair is moving now! And now my chair is moving! James! Don't do this to me!

HESTON

At this minute, Keech is building a new home in a village near here with my son's money. Stop him!

RICHARD

I'm sorry, James. I can't. (He gets a book and throws it across the room. ) I didn't want – that was my hand but – James, can you get in my head? Can you tell my hand--

He looks at his hand and at the book.

HESTON

(Laughing ) Yes, Richard. And your answer is going to be 'Yes'. Or you are going to do this again and again and again and--

Richard gets a book and throws it across the room again. Then he runs across the room. Then he moves the table, the chairs and his chair.

Heston laughs. Richard stops.

RICHARD

I'm going mad! Why does my hand throw a book, when I don't want to? Can all dead people do this? Can they get in a man's head, so he moves a chair or throws a book?

'I'm going mad!'

HESTON

Oh yes. Now, I can do it to you again or you can say 'Yes' and get my son's money. Which?

RICHARD

But how? How can I get the money from Keech?

HESTON

Sit down. I'm going to tell you.

David Keech in court

In the court we can see Judge Timms, Keech, Barker, Reynolds, Richard and Mary. There are six women and six men behind Keech. They are from the village and they are watching the trial. Judge Timms is in a big chair in front of the court.

The trial of David Keech.

BARKER

(Standing ) My name is Oliver Barker. And I speak for Richard Little here today.

He sits. Reynolds stands up.

REYNOLDS

Judge Timms. I speak for David Keech here today. My name is Philip Reynolds. (He sits .)

WOMAN 1

That Keech took the boy's money. You can see it in his face.

WOMAN 2

Oh Lil, we must listen to Oliver Barker and Philip Reynolds first.

MAN 1

Keech is the boy Tom's father now.

MAN 2

A good father doesn't take his son's money and build a new house with it.

TIMMS

Be quiet in my court!

WOMAN 1

Sorry!

TIMMS

Oliver Barker. You can begin.

BARKER

(Standing ) Judge Timms. Before James Heston died, he said this to Richard Little. He said, 'My boy gets my money at twenty-one and not before.'

TIMMS

(Writing ) 'At twenty-one and not before...'

BARKER

Yes, judge. But Keech has this money now. The boy's money. He is building a big house with it. We all know that.

MAN 1

(Starting to eat something ) Put Keech in prison, I say.

MAN 6

(Eating ) Five years.

WOMAN 6

(Eating ) No, ten.

TIMMS

You! Don't eat in my court! Philip Reynolds. Speak.

REYNOLDS

(Standing ) Judge Timms. Yes, there is a house in a village near here. And, yes, it is Keech's house. But the money for it is not young Tom's money.

TIMMS

(Writing ) Not Tom's money.

REYNOLDS

No, Judge Timms. It is David Keech's money.

Reynolds sits.

BARKER

(Standing ) So one day Keech is not rich and the next day he is rich? He has money for a house?

Men and women laugh. Barker sits.

REYNOLDS

(Standing ) Call David Keech.

Keech stands in front of Judge Timms.

REYNOLDS

David Keech. Where is the boy Tom's money?

Do you have it at home?

KEECH

No.

WOMAN 3

Keech took the money! It was Keech!

WOMAN 6

I said, 'Keech took the money!' I said that yesterday!

KEECH

I have the money here. In this court.

MEN AND WOMEN 1-3

(All talking ) No! Never! Keech didn't take the money then! The money's here! Here in this court!

KEECH

The money is under my chair. You! Woman! Bring me the money!

WOMAN 1

Me?

KEECH

Yes, you! (There is a bag under Keech's chair. Woman 1 takes it and gives it to Keech. )

WOMAN 1

Here you are. (She sits down again. )

KEECH

(Opening the bag and taking out money ) Here! Judge Timms! Here! Richard Little! Here! Look, everybody! Here is the money! So I didn't take it from the boy! You hear me, Richard Little?

RICHARD

(Afraid ) Yes.

TIMMS

One minute! Richard Little.

RICHARD

(Standing, looking afraid ) Yes, Judge Timms?

TIMMS

You said, 'Keech took the boy's money'. You said that. Why? Why, man, why? Why say that?

RICHARD

Because – because. Because James Heston came to my home. James Heston said it to me.

MEN AND WOMEN 4-6

(All talking ) James Heston? Did he say 'Heston'? Heston's dead. A ghost came?

TIMMS

Richard Little, James Heston is dead. He died in 1651.

MEN AND WOMEN

(All laughing and talking ) He talked to a dead man! James Heston! Oh, that's a laugh!

MARY

(Standing ) Judge Timms. My husband is ill. In our house he talks to people and there is nobody there. Can I take him home now, please?

'Can I take him home now, please?'

The men and women are all laughing.

RICHARD

I am not ill! Stop laughing! Be quiet, all of you! Sit down, Mary.

Men and women stop laughing. Mary sits down.

RICHARD

Thank you! (It is quiet in the court now. ) Yes. James Heston is dead. And yes, James Heston spoke to me. I want James Heston here. Now. He can tell you.

MAN 4

He is ill!

MAN 5

He's mad!

WOMAN 4

Let's listen to him.

WOMAN 5

Yes, we can listen to him.

TIMMS

Be quiet! Call James Heston! I say, call James Heston to this court!

KEECH

Heston is dead, man! And Richard Little is mad!

TIMMS

Call James Heston!

For a minute, we can hear nothing. Then we hear James Heston's voice, but we cannot see him.

HESTON'S GHOST

I am James Heston.

MEN AND WOMEN

Aaaaaagh! Oh! Oh, but he's dead!

KEECH

No! No! Oh please no!

MEN AND WOMEN

(All talking ) It's Heston! Is Heston dead, then? Aaaagh! Oh I'm afraid! Oh please!

TIMMS

James Heston? Is it you? Did you speak to Richard Little?

HESTON'S GHOST

Yes.

TIMMS

What did you say?

HESTON'S GHOST

I told him, Keech took my boy's money. And then Keech killed a man in the next village. He was a rich man. Keech took his money. You see the money now. Here. In this court.

KEECH

Aaagh! I can't kill Heston. Heston is dead. But you! You, Richard Little! You brought me to this court. I'm going to kill you next!

Keech runs out of the court.

TIMMS

Stop him! Stop him!

MEN AND WOMEN

(All talking ) It was Keech! Keech took the money! I said that! I said, 'Keech took the money!'

TIMMS

第一场理查德·利特尔遇鬼

理查德·利特尔遇鬼

1653年。一个寒冷漆黑的冬夜，年约四十的理查德·利特尔坐在椅子上读书。他听到了什么动静，于是走到窗前，向外看去，然后回到椅子上。他的妻子玛丽走了进来。玛丽正在做裙子，手中捧着那条裙子。

理查德：

玛丽，我听到外面有什么动静。

玛丽：

什么都没有。读你的书吧，理查德。

理查德：

来坐我身边吧。

玛丽：

不行，我正在做裙子呢。我要上楼去了。

理查德：

玛丽，求你了。外面有动静。

玛丽：

唉，理查德！

玛丽下场，詹姆斯·赫斯顿的幽灵上场。

赫斯顿：

你好，理查德。

理查德：

啊！是你！詹姆斯！詹姆斯·赫斯顿！可是你——你已经死了呀！

赫斯顿：

我是死了。可就是因为你，我不得安宁。

理查德：

因为我？为什么——为什么是因为我呢？

赫斯顿：

我死之后，贝丝又嫁了一个丈夫。那个禽兽——基奇。

理查德：

是的。贝丝是个好女人，也是我的好姐姐。我当时跟她说：“别跟基奇走。想想詹姆斯吧，他刚死呀。”

赫斯顿：

她嫁给基奇才三个月就死了。现在基奇霸占了我的儿子，而且还霸占了我儿子的财产。

理查德：

啊，我现在明白了。

赫斯顿：

啊，你现在想起来了？我死之前曾对你说：“我儿子到21岁才能继承我的财产。”他现在才8岁，8岁呀。基奇就霸占了他的财产。

理查德：

听到这事我很难过，可是我能做什么呢？

赫斯顿：

你必须拿到我儿子的财产，从基奇那里拿回来。

理查德：

不！基奇一只手就能要了我的命。他是个大块头——他兜里总是装着刀。去年，他就是用那把刀杀了一个人。我害怕他呀，詹姆斯。

赫斯顿：

你害怕我吗？

理查德：

不。啊，是的，有一点儿怕。你是个幽灵呀！

赫斯顿：

只是有一点儿吗？嗯？看那张桌子。

理查德：

（盯着那张桌子 ）啊呀！桌子动了！（他站起身来，走到桌旁。 ）啊呀！啊，现在椅子也动了！现在我的椅子也在动！詹姆斯！别这样对我！

赫斯顿：

这会儿基奇正在附近的一个村子里盖新房，用的就是我儿子的钱。去阻止他！

理查德：

很抱歉，詹姆斯，我不能。（他拿起一本书朝房间的另一头扔去。 ）我不想——那是我的手，不过——詹姆斯，你能钻进我的脑袋里吗？你能让我的手——

他看着自己的手和那本书。

赫斯顿：

（哈哈大笑 ）是的，理查德。你的答案必须是“可以”。不然你就会一遍一遍又一遍地这么做——

理查德拿过一本书又朝房间的另一头扔去，接着他跑到房间的另一头，移动桌子，移动椅子，又移动他自己的那把椅子。

赫斯顿哈哈大笑。理查德停了下来。

理查德：

我要发疯了！为什么我本来不想，我的手却去扔书呢？所有的死人都能这么做吗？他们能钻进人的脑袋里，让人移动椅子和扔书吗？

赫斯顿：

哦，那当然了。现在，我可以再对你做一次，或者你就回答“可以”，然后去夺回我儿子的财产。你选哪个？

理查德：

可是我该怎么做呢？我怎么才能把钱从基奇那里夺回来呢？

赫斯顿：

坐下，我来告诉你。

第二场戴维·基奇出庭

戴维·基奇出庭

法庭上有蒂姆斯法官、基奇、巴克、雷诺兹、理查德和玛丽。基奇身后有六女六男，他们是来观看庭审的村民。蒂姆斯法官在法庭正前方，坐在一把大椅子上。

巴克：

（站起来 ）我叫奥利弗·巴克，今天代表理查德·利特尔。

巴克坐下。雷诺兹起身。

雷诺兹：

蒂姆斯法官，我今天代表戴维·基奇。我叫菲利普·雷诺兹。（雷诺兹坐下。 ）。

村妇甲：

那个基奇霸占了那孩子的财产，从他脸上就能看出来。

村妇乙：

喂，利尔，我们得先听听奥利弗·巴克和菲利普·雷诺兹怎么说。

村夫甲：

基奇现在是汤姆那孩子的父亲。

村夫乙：

一个好父亲是不会拿儿子的钱去盖新房的。

蒂姆斯：

保持法庭肃静！

村妇甲：

对不起！

蒂姆斯：

奥利弗·巴克，你可以发言了。

巴克：

（站起来 ）蒂姆斯法官，詹姆斯·赫斯顿死前曾对理查德·利特尔说了如下的话，他说：“我儿子到21岁才能继承我的财产。”

蒂姆斯：

（记录 ）“到21岁才能继承……”

巴克：

是的，法官。可基奇现在占有了这些财产——那孩子的财产。他正用这笔钱盖一座大房子，这我们都知道。

村夫甲：

（开始吃东西 ）我说，把基奇扔到监狱里去。

村夫己：

（吃东西 ）关上5年。

村妇己：

（吃东西 ）不，关上10年。

蒂姆斯：

你们别在法庭上吃东西！菲利普·雷诺兹，你说吧。

雷诺兹：

（站起来 ）蒂姆斯法官。是的，这附近一个村子里有一栋房子。不错，那房子是基奇的，可是盖房子用的不是小汤姆的钱。

蒂姆斯：

（记录 ）不是汤姆的钱。

雷诺兹：

是的，蒂姆斯法官。用的是戴维·基奇自己的钱。

雷诺兹坐下。

巴克：

（站起来 ）那么前一天基奇还没钱呢，第二天他就成富人了？他有钱盖房子吗？

村民们笑了起来。巴克坐下。

雷诺兹：

（站起来 ）传戴维·基奇。

基奇站到蒂姆斯法官面前。

雷诺兹：

戴维·基奇，那个叫汤姆的孩子的钱哪儿去了？在你家里吗？

基奇：

不在。

村妇丙：

基奇把钱拿走了！就是基奇！

村妇己：

我说过：“基奇把钱拿走了！”我昨天就说了！

基奇：

我把钱放这儿了，在这个法庭上。

村夫甲乙丙和村妇甲乙丙：

（交头接耳 ）不！不可能！这么说基奇没有拿那些钱！钱都在这儿！在法庭上！

基奇：

钱就在我的座椅下面。你！那个女人！把钱给我拿过来！

村妇甲：

我？

基奇：

是的，就是你！（基奇的座椅下面有个袋子。村妇甲把袋子取出来，交给了基奇。 ）

村妇甲：

给你。（她又回到座位上。 ）

基奇：

（打开袋子，拿出钱来 ）在这儿！蒂姆斯法官！在这儿！理查德·利特尔！在这儿！大家都看看啊！钱在这儿！我没有拿那孩子的钱！你听到我的话了吗，理查德·利特尔？

理查德：

（战战兢兢的 ）是的。

蒂姆斯：

等一下，理查德·利特尔。

理查德：

（站起来，表情战战兢兢的 ）什么事，蒂姆斯法官？

蒂姆斯：

你说：“基奇霸占了那孩子的财产。”你说过这话，为什么？为什么呢，伙计，为什么？为什么那么说？

理查德：

因为……因为……因为詹姆斯·赫斯顿来我家找我了，是詹姆斯·赫斯顿告诉我的。

村夫丁戊己和村妇丁戊己：

（交头接耳 ）詹姆斯·赫斯顿？他是说“赫斯顿”吗？可是赫斯顿已经死了呀。幽灵现身？

蒂姆斯：

理查德·利特尔，詹姆斯·赫斯顿已经死了。他1651年就死了。

村民们：

（全都哈哈大笑，交头接耳 ）他跟死人聊天！詹姆斯·赫斯顿！啊，简直是笑话！

玛丽：

（站起来 ）蒂姆斯法官，我丈夫病了。在我们家里，他跟空气说话。我现在能带他回家吗？求您了！

村民们全都哈哈大笑。

理查德：

我没病！别笑了！你们全都安静！坐下，玛丽。

村民们止住笑声。玛丽坐下。

理查德：

谢谢你们！（现在法庭安静下来。 ）是的，詹姆斯·赫斯顿已经死了。可詹姆斯·赫斯顿的确跟我说话了，我想让詹姆斯·赫斯顿到这儿来，就现在，让他来告诉你们。

村夫丁：

他真是病了！

村夫戊：

他疯了！

村妇丁：

咱们听他说吧。

村妇戊：

是的，咱们听他说说看。

蒂姆斯：

肃静！传詹姆斯·赫斯顿！听着，传詹姆斯·赫斯顿到庭！

基奇：

嘿，赫斯顿死了！理查德·利特尔疯了！

蒂姆斯：

传詹姆斯·赫斯顿！

有那么一会儿，观众什么也没听到。后来，观众听到詹姆斯·赫斯顿的声音，但看不到他。

赫斯顿的幽灵：

我是詹姆斯·赫斯顿。

村民们：

啊！啊呀！可他已经死了呀！

基奇：

不！不！不要啊！

村民们：

（交头接耳 ）是赫斯顿！那么赫斯顿真的死了吗？啊！我好害怕！天哪！

蒂姆斯：

詹姆斯·赫斯顿？是你吗？你曾经跟理查德·利特尔讲过话吗？

赫斯顿的幽灵：

是的。

蒂姆斯：

你当时怎么说的？

赫斯顿的幽灵：

我告诉他基奇霸占了我儿子的财产。后来基奇杀了邻村一个人，那是个富人，基奇抢走了他的钱。你现在可以看到那人的钱，就在这儿，在法庭上。

基奇：

啊！我杀不了赫斯顿，因为他已经死了。可是你！你，理查德·利特尔！是你把我弄到这法庭上来的，我接下来就要杀掉你！

基奇跑出了法庭。

蒂姆斯：

拦住他！拦住他！

村民们：

（交头接耳 ）就是基奇！是基奇拿走了那些钱！我说过的！我说过：“基奇拿走了那些钱！”

蒂姆斯：

本法庭判定：“基奇霸占了财产，并杀了一个人。”现在去找戴维·基奇，把他带来见我！

第三场基奇找到了理查德·利特尔

基奇找到了理查德·利特尔

理查德待在家里，坐在椅子上。

理查德：

那是什么声音？我是听到什么了吗？玛丽，是你吗？啊呀，不会又是詹姆斯吧！詹姆斯，是你吗？（他看着大门，害怕极了。 ）

啊！啊呀！

戴维·基奇闯了进来，他拿着一把刀。

理查德：

不！基奇，求你了！不要啊！

基奇杀死了理查德后便逃跑了。玛丽进来看到了理查德。

玛丽：

天哪！不！不是理查德吧。不会是我最最亲爱的理查德吧。基奇杀了他。基奇，你将为此进大牢！

第四场狱中探访基奇

狱中探访基奇

基奇在狱中。他坐在床上，牢房里有一张桌子和一把椅子，还有一本书。

基奇：

有人吗？那是什么？有人在那儿吗？啊！我的桌子！我的桌子动了。（他站了起来。 ）啊！现在床也动了。我病了吗？啊！我的脑袋！（他用双手抱住头。 ）啊！现在椅子也动了。怎么回事？（他拿起书，扔到牢房的另一头。 ）我为什么那么做？我疯了吗？这是我的手，可是——

理查德的幽灵上场。

基奇：

啊！你已经死了！我杀了你！

理查德：

是的，我已经死了，是你杀了我。可我不打算离开，我就待在这儿，和你一同待在监狱里。

基奇想要打理查德的幽灵，可他打不着。理查德笑了起来。

理查德：

你现在打不了我了。你打不了幽灵，你也不能再杀我一次。不过我们可以聊聊，我们有的是时间，我们整个白天都可以聊天。

基奇把一本书扔到牢房的另一头。

理查德：

而且你也可以整个白天都干这个。

基奇：

整个白天？一刻不停？

理查德：

是的。（他躺在床上。 ）现在再把书扔到牢房的另一头。（基奇照做了。 ）再扔一次再扔一次再扔一次。

基奇：

（一次又一次不停地扔书 ）啊不！求你了！我以后每个白天都会像这样吗？

理查德：

是的，你每个白天都是这样。至于你晚上的时间——我这儿还有个朋友。

詹姆斯·赫斯顿的幽灵上场。

赫斯顿：

你好，理查德。你好，戴维。

基奇：

是你！你也来这儿了！

赫斯顿：

（微笑着 ）是的。戴维，请把书扔到牢房的另一头。（基奇照做了。 ）谢谢。我以后晚上就会到这里来，戴维，而每个白天都有理查德在这儿，怎么样？

基奇：

啊不！不！

赫斯顿：

一个幽灵负责白天，一个幽灵负责晚上。嗳，再把书扔到牢房的另一头去。

Gilbert, can I come with you? To America?

GILBERT

(He is reading. Looking up ) What?

JENNY

Oh, Gilbert! Please listen to me! I said 'Can I come to America too?'

GILBERT

(Eating some bread ) Mmmm. This is good bread. Did you make it?

JENNY

Yes. Gilbert! I said, 'Can I come with you?'

GILBERT

No, Jenny. You have work here. There's the house, the garden...

He begins to read his book again.

JENNY

I remember My New Friend . It was your best film. It was my best film, too! They were happy days.

GILBERT

(He puts the book down, smiling .) Yes. I watched My New Friend again last week. It's the best Gilbert Lawson film. And you were good in it, my love! You're a good actress.

JENNY

(Smiling ) The film had a good director! Gilbert Lawson!

GILBERT

Oh, thank you! But now I have this new film, so I must go to America for six weeks.

JENNY

Gilbert, can I be in this film, too? I want to be an actress again.

GILBERT

Perhaps next time. Would you like that? Perhaps you can be in the next film.

JENNY

You said that before.

GILBERT

Did I? (Eating again ) Yes, this bread is very good.

'Yes, this bread is very good.'

JENNY

Can we go to America together then? Not for a film. Just you and me. Perhaps next year?

GILBERT

Perhaps. (He smiles at her. )

JENNY

(Smiling at him ) Next year, then.

GILBERT

Yes. Next year. Love, I must go now. I'm going to be late for the plane. I love you, Jenny.

Man, I want a drink. Twenty miles in one morning! Are the bicycles OK, in the street?

BRAD

In this little village? Oh yes! Nobody steals bicycles here.

JERRY

How do you know? This is your first time here. First time in England. Or am I wrong?

BRAD

No, you're right. But – I remember this village. I was here before, Jerry. I can feel it.

JERRY

Oh come on! We were out in the sun for five hours. You need to drink some cold water, my friend!

BRAD

This hotel opened in 1853, right?

JERRY

(He gets a book about Britain out of his bag and looks in it .) Right, Brad, you looked at this book before.

BRAD

No, I didn't. Hey, you know something? (He looks at his watch .) It's one-fifteen. My dad died at this minute, on this day last month.

JERRY

Oh, Brad. I'm sorry.

BRAD

No, no. It's OK. I'm going to go back to New York next week, after our three weeks in England. And I'm going to be 'Brad Davis, of Davis TV'. Dad wanted that.

They stayed at the hotel in the village.

JERRY

Yeah. Hey, come on! Let's go out in the sun. Let's see the village. Have a drink. Find some girls.

BRAD

No, you go. I like it here. Here in the room.

JERRY

OK. Let's stay in the room. Hey! There's a television. (Jerry puts the television on but nothing happens. ) Hmm.

BRAD

Not working? Oh, forget it.

JERRY

No! You're Brad Davis of Davis Television, the biggest in America. You must have a television! Look, shall I go down and ask Mrs Finch? You stay here. You look tired.

BRAD

Yeah, thanks, Jerry. I am tired.

Jerry goes out. Brad looks at the book about Britain.

BRAD

(Reading from the book ) 'In 1760 the hotel was a house. A family called Bannister lived in the house. One day, the nineteen-year-old daughter, Eellen--'

The ghost of Ellen Bannister comes in. She is wearing a dress from 1760.

ELLEN

I was never nineteen. I died at eighteen.

BRAD

Yes, I remember you. Hello, Ellen.

'Hello, Ellen.'

ELLEN

Hello, Matthew. Why does your friend call you Brad? Is that a name?

BRAD

Yes. It's an American name.

ELLEN

But you are Matthew and I'm going to call you Matthew. Always. Oh Matthew. I waited and waited and waited for you. I love you so much. Do you love me?

BRAD

Yes. I think – Yes, I do.

ELLEN

You think! Is that an answer? After all these years? Oh Matthew! Matthew, do you remember everything?

BRAD

No, not everything. I remember our love. And you died, I remember that. I wanted to die too. And again last month, I wanted to die.

ELLEN

Oh Matthew! Don't say that! Oh Matthew, I'm so happy to see you again.

BRAD

Ellen. Can I see you? Can we talk?

ELLEN

Oh yes. I want to talk to you about—

Jerry comes in with Mrs Finch. Ellen runs out.

MRS FINCH

Are you OK, love? You look white.

JERRY

This is not a happy time for Brad.

MRS FINCH

I'm sorry, love. Do you want some dinner? I make the best dinner in the north of England.

'I make the best dinner in the north of England.'

BRAD

(Smiling ) No, thank you.

MRS FINCH

Talk to me later, then. Right, the television. (She hits the television. ) It's OK now. Bye-bye, Brad. Bye, Jerry. Have a nice time in our village.

She goes to the door.

BRAD

Mrs Finch! Wait, please. Do you know about the Bannister family?

MRS FINCH

Did you see the ghost? Ellen Bannister?

BRAD

Yes.

JERRY

What? Brad, you saw a ghost? Oh, come on!

MRS FINCH

Oh, Ellen's always here. She likes young men. She's always looking for her boyfriend. Matthew's his name, I think.

BRAD

Mrs Finch, what happened? How did she die? What happened to Matthew?

MRS FINCH

You're interested, love, I can see that. There's an old woman in the village. Her name is Maud Anscombe. She knows about Ellen. You ask Maud. (She goes out .)

Brad, this ghost – What did she say?

So she was a witch?

MAUD

Yes. She looked at animals too. Then all the cows in the village had no milk in them.

'Then all the cows in the village had no milk in them.'

JERRY

Was she a witch? Some people say that.

A witch? (Laughing ) No, of course not. The men loved her. She helped them, you see. The women didn't love her so much. She was beautiful, you see.

It is night time. Jerry is sitting on the bed. Brad is walking up and down.

BRAD

Seven hours. We waited seven hours. Where is she, Jerry?

JERRY

I said this before. I don't know. Just wait.

BRAD

She isn't coming, because you're here.

JERRY

Brad, I say again. One. I sleep here. This is my room. Two. I am your friend and I am not leaving you like this.

BRAD

Jerry, is this all a big laugh for you?

JERRY

No. Not now. I want to see Ellen, too. I want to help.

BRAD

OK. Thanks, Jerry. Sorry. Hey, here she is.

The ghost of Ellen comes into the room.

BRAD

Ellen, Ellen. It's me. Brad, Matthew.

JERRY

Man, oh man! It's all true!

BRAD

Ellen, please. Tell me, what happened, in 1760?

ELLEN

You must remember!

BRAD

No.

ELLEN

We sold things, you and me. Rich people's things. You stole them, remember?

JERRY

Wow! Brad, you were Robin Hood! Sorry!

ELLEN

The rich people didn't like me. They said bad things about me. 'Ellen Bannister is a witch.' They said that, but it's not true.

BRAD

Of course not.

ELLEN

Then, one day, they came for us. Twenty men.

BRAD

What happened?

ELLEN

We ran away. You found a ship. A ship going to America. You said, 'See you at one-fifteen. At the harbour. We can go away, you and me.'

BRAD

And then what happened, Ellen?

ELLEN

The ship went early. I wasn't there in time. You went on the ship. You didn't wait for me.

'You didn't wait for me.'

BRAD

Oh no!

ELLEN

When I arrived, there were a lot of ships there. I didn't know the name of our ship. I looked for you. I waited and waited and waited.

BRAD

Ellen! Oh Ellen, I'm sorry.

ELLEN

Then the men came. They put me in prison. I died three months later. And then I came back home. Here. And I waited again. I waited for you.

BRAD

I love you, Ellen.

I love you too, Matthew.

SCENE 5What is Brad going to do?

What is Brad going to do?

It is dark. Brad is standing at the window of the room. Jerry comes in. Brad always has his back to Jerry in this scene.

JERRY

Do you want to die? Do you want to go to Ellen?

BRAD

Before today, the answer was 'Yes'. Matthew wanted to die and go to be with Ellen. Do you understand that?

JERRY

Yes.

BRAD

But Matthew is dead and I am Brad now.

JERRY

And what does Brad want?

BRAD

I don't know. I'm thinking. Is there a train from here to London tomorrow?

JERRY

Yes. We can put our bicycles on the train. We can get the next plane back to America. Do you want to do that?

BRAD

I don't know. I'm going to tell you tomorrow.

The next day. Brad and Jerry are in the street. Jerry has two bags. Mrs Finch is there too.

You must leave, then? A week early?

Yes. I'm sorry.

Mrs Morgan comes past the hotel.

MRS MORGAN

Oh hello. It's the American boys. Are you going home to America?

BRAD

Jerry's going home, Mrs Morgan. I'm staying here, at the hotel. I'm going to live here. Always.

JERRY

Brad, do you want to do this? Think about Davis TV. What are you going to do, here in England?

BRAD

I don't know. But, yes, Davis TV needs a good man. My dad worked for years for Davis TV. But now it has a good man, Jerry. You.

JERRY

Me? Oh! Thank you, Brad.

BRAD

That's OK. I'm happy. I'm in love. She waited for me and now I'm here. I'm never going to leave her again.

布拉德见到一个幽灵

布拉德和杰里走进宾馆的房间，把旅行包放下。天气炎热，他们穿着夏衫。布拉德坐在床上。

杰里：

伙计，我想来杯喝的。一早上赶了二十英里路！自行车放在街边没事儿吧？

布拉德：

在这个小村子里？没事！这儿没人偷自行车。

杰里：

你怎么知道？这是你第一次来这儿，第一次来英国。要不我搞错了？

布拉德：

不，你说得对。可是——我记得这个村子。我以前来过这里，杰里。我能感觉到。

杰里：

唉，算了吧！我们在大太阳底下待了五个小时。你该喝点儿凉水了，我的朋友。

布拉德：

这家旅馆1853年开业的，对吗？

杰里：

（他从旅行包里掏出一本介绍英国的书查阅起来。 ）是的，布拉德。你以前看过这书吧。

布拉德：

不，我没有。嘿，你知道吗？（他看着自己的手表。 ）一点十五分了。我父亲就是上个月这一天的这个时间去世的。

杰里：

噢，布拉德。我很难过。

布拉德：

不，不，没事。咱们在英格兰待了三周了，我下周就要回纽约了。我将会成为“戴维斯电视台的布拉德·戴维斯”——这是父亲的愿望。

杰里：

是吗？嘿，来吧！咱们出去晒晒太阳，去看看这个村子。喝一杯，找几个姑娘。

布拉德：

不，你去吧。我喜欢这儿，我就待在房间里。

杰里：

好吧，那咱们就待在房间里。嘿！这儿有台电视机。（杰里打开了电视，可没有图像。 ）嗯。

布拉德：

坏了？唉，别管它了。

杰里：

不行！你可是美国最大的电视台戴维斯电视台的布拉德·戴维斯。你必须有一台电视机！哎，要不要我下楼去问问芬奇夫人？你待在这儿，你看起来很累。

布拉德：

好吧，谢谢你，杰里。我累了。

杰里下场。布拉德看着那本介绍英国的书。

布拉德：

（念书 ）“1760年，这家旅馆还是一栋住宅。一家姓班尼斯特的人住在这栋房子里。一天，他们十九岁的女儿埃伦——”

埃伦·班尼斯特的幽灵上场。她穿着1760年款式的长裙。

埃伦：

我从未长到十九岁，我十八岁时就死了。

布拉德：

对，我想起你来了。你好，埃伦。

埃伦：

你好，马修。为什么你的朋友管你叫布拉德？那是一个名字吗？

布拉德：

是的，那是个美国名字。

埃伦：

可你是马修，我要管你叫马修。永远叫马修。啊，马修。我一直在等你，等了又等。我那么爱你，你爱我吗？

布拉德：

爱。我想——我爱你。

埃伦：

你还用想！那就是答案吗？这么多年之后？唉，马修！马修，你还记得以前的一切吗？

布拉德：

不，不是所有事都记得。我记得我们俩相爱，还记得你死了，当时我也想死。上个月，我又一次想去死。

埃伦：

噢，马修！别那么说！噢，马修，我很高兴又能见到你。

布拉德：

埃伦，我能看见你吗？咱们能说说话吗？

埃伦：

噢，当然可以。我想给你讲讲—

杰里和芬奇夫人一起进来了。埃伦跑了出去。

芬奇夫人：

你没事吧，亲爱的？你看起来面色苍白。

杰里：

这段日子布拉德不太好过。

芬奇夫人：

我为你担心，亲爱的。你想吃点儿东西吗？我做的饭可是英格兰北部最好吃的。

布拉德：

（微笑着 ）不了，谢谢您。

芬奇夫人：

那么待会儿再叫我吧。对了，电视。（她拍打着电视机。 ）现在好了。拜拜，布拉德。拜拜，杰里。祝你们在我们村里玩得开心。

她往门口走去。

布拉德：

芬奇夫人！请等等。你知道班尼斯特家的事吗？

芬奇夫人：

你看到幽灵了？埃伦·班尼斯特？

布拉德：

是的。

杰里：

什么？布拉德，你见到了一个幽灵？啊呀，得了吧！

芬奇夫人：

唉，埃伦总在这儿出现。她喜欢年轻人，她一直在寻找她的男朋友。我想他叫马修。

布拉德：

芬奇夫人，发生了什么事？她是怎么死的？马修怎么了？

芬奇夫人：

你很感兴趣啊，亲爱的，我能看出来。村里有个老太太，她叫莫德·安斯科姆。她知道埃伦的事。你去问问她吧。（下场。 ）

杰里：

布拉德，这个幽灵——她都说了些什么？

布拉德：

（没有看杰里 ）她——她没说话，杰里。她什么都没说。

第二场布拉德和杰里想了解埃伦

布拉德和杰里想了解埃伦

莫德是一位年迈的老太太，头发花白。布拉德、杰里和她围坐在她家的桌旁。

莫德：

埃伦·班尼斯特？一个非常非常坏的女孩。她看谁一眼，第二天那个人就会生病。

杰里：

这么说她是个女巫？

莫德：

是的。牲畜也是，给她看过之后，村里所有的奶牛都不产奶了。

布拉德：

（生气地 ）你——你知道？你怎么知道的？谁告诉你的？

莫德：

啊，所有的书里都是这么写的。我们村子就是因为这个邪恶的埃伦·班尼斯特而出了名。

第三场埃伦是女巫吗？

埃伦是女巫吗？

布拉德和杰里在摩根夫人的乡村商店里。店里有两个男人、三个女人，还有摩根夫人。

摩根夫人：

你好？你是下一位吗？

杰里：

是的，我要两杯可乐，还要两个那种三明治。

布拉德：

我不饿。

杰里：

伙计，你必须得吃点东西。你不能整天坐在房间里等一个幽灵。

摩根夫人拿来了可乐和三明治。

摩根夫人：

一共是六英镑。（杰里把钱给她。 ）是谁的幽灵？埃伦·班尼斯特的吗？

布拉德：

（生气地 ）是的！

杰里：

你知道埃伦·班尼斯特的事儿吗？

摩根夫人：

哦，当时我们村里的人都没有什么钱，他们偷东西也是会有的事，偷来的东西埃伦·班尼斯特负责销赃。她只是想要帮帮忙而已。

杰里：

她是个女巫吗？有人是这么说的。

摩根夫人：

女巫？（哈哈大笑 ）不，当然不是。男人们都喜欢她。她帮助他们，就这样。女人们不怎么喜欢她，要知道，她很漂亮。

村妇甲：

她的男朋友才是个坏人，那个马修。她不坏。

布拉德：

（喝着可乐 ）哦，他都干了些什么？

村妇乙：

他偷富人家的东西。然后埃伦把东西卖掉，他拿走了所有的钱。他还把埃伦所有的钱都拿走了。可是埃伦爱他。

布拉德：

他爱埃伦吗？

村夫甲：

不。他有两三个女人呢。

村妇丙：

不，他没有！他爱她。他是为她而生的。

村夫乙：

你们在说谁？那个女巫埃伦·班尼斯特？她早餐吃猫肉的。

村妇丙：

（对布拉德和杰里说 ）喂，别听他的。

摩根夫人：

（哈哈大笑 ）你们俩别听这些人的。埃伦·班尼斯特发生了什么事？你们想要知道吗？马修杀了她。

第四场埃伦现在在哪里？

埃伦现在在哪里？

晚上。杰里坐在床上，布拉德在屋里走来走去。

布拉德：

七个小时，我们等了七个小时了。她在哪儿，杰里？

杰里：

我已经说过了，我不知道。就等等吧。

布拉德：

她不来了，因为你在这儿。

杰里：

布拉德，我再说一遍。第一，我睡在这儿，这是我的房间。第二，我是你的朋友，我不能把你就这么留在这儿。

布拉德：

杰里，这在你看来是个大笑话吗？

杰里：

不，现在还不是。我也想见见埃伦，我想帮帮忙。

布拉德：

好吧。谢谢你，杰里。对不起。嘿，她来了。

埃伦的幽灵进入了房间。

布拉德：

埃伦，埃伦。是我，布拉德，是马修。

杰里：

天啊！这都是真的！

布拉德：

埃伦，求你了。告诉我，1760年的时候发生了什么事？

埃伦：

你一定记得！

布拉德：

不，我不记得。

埃伦：

我们卖东西，你和我，富人的东西。是你偷的，你记得吗？

杰里：

哇！布拉德，你是罗宾汉！抱歉！

埃伦：

富人不喜欢我。他们说我坏话，说：“埃伦·班尼斯特是个女巫。”他们那么说，可那不是真的。

布拉德：

当然不是真的。

埃伦：

后来有一天，他们来找我们了，一共有二十个男人。

布拉德：

发生了什么事？

埃伦：

我们逃跑了。你找到一条船，一条开往美国的船。你说：“一点十五分，码头见。我们就能逃走了，你和我。”

布拉德：

后来发生了什么事，埃伦？

埃伦：

船早开了，我没有及时赶到。你上了船，你没有等我。

布拉德：

啊呀！

埃伦：

我到达时，发现那儿有很多船。我不知道我们那艘船的名字。我四处找你，等了又等。

布拉德：

埃伦！啊，埃伦，我很抱歉。

埃伦：

随后那些人就来了，他们把我投进监狱。三个月后，我就死了。于是我回到了家，就是这儿。我又开始等你出现，我一直在等你。

布拉德：

我爱你，埃伦。

埃伦：

我也爱你，马修。

第五场布拉德打算怎样？

布拉德打算怎样？

天黑了，布拉德站在窗前，杰里走了进来。在这一场中，布拉德始终背对着杰里。

杰里：

你想死吗？你想去找埃伦吗？

布拉德：

今天之前，答案是“对”。马修想要死掉，去和埃伦在一起。你能理解吗？

杰里：

能。

布拉德：

可是马修死了，而我现在是布拉德。

杰里：

那布拉德想要做什么？

布拉德：

我不知道，我正在考虑。明天这里有一班去伦敦的火车吗？

杰里：

是的。我们可以把自行车放到火车上，然后乘下一班飞机回美国。你想这么做吗？

布拉德：

我不知道。我明天告诉你吧。

第六场爱上一个幽灵

爱上一个幽灵

第二天。布拉德和杰里在街上，杰里拎着两个旅行包，芬奇夫人也在那儿。

芬奇夫人：

那么，你一定要离开吗？提前一周？

杰里：

是的，很抱歉。

摩根夫人路过旅馆。

摩根夫人：

唉，你们好，两个美国男孩，你们要回美国吗？

布拉德：

杰里要回家了，摩根夫人。我要待在这儿，待在旅馆里。我往后都住这儿了。

杰里：

布拉德，你想这么做吗？想想戴维斯电视台吧。你在英格兰要做些什么？

布拉德：

我不知道。不过，对了，戴维斯电视台需要一个出色的人。我父亲为戴维斯电视台工作多年。而现在，它又有一个出色的人了，杰里，就是你。

杰里：

我？啊！谢谢你，布拉德。

布拉德：

别客气。我很高兴，我坠入爱河了。她一直在等我，而现在我来到了这里，我再也不会离开她了。

内容简介


19世纪30年代的法国。富人乘坐马车，用金餐具吃喝。穷人没有工作，没有食物，没有希望——他们是穷苦人，起义一触即发。法国人民还记得1789年的法国大革命。当时，民众在巴黎街头筑起街垒，死去的人数以千计。这样的时刻又要到来了吗？

这是冉阿让的故事。他坐了19年的牢，终于恢复了自由身。可是，他怎么生活，到哪里去找工作呢？像他这样一个人，还有什么希望呢？这也是沙威的故事，他是一个督察，一个残忍的人，一个冷酷的人。他的人生只有一个目标——把冉阿让再次送进大牢。这还是芳汀的故事，芳汀和她的女儿珂赛特。她们的故事是怎样改变了冉阿让的一生？这也是马吕斯的故事。他是巴黎的一名学生，做好了为起义而牺牲的准备——或是为爱情而死。最后，还有伽弗洛什——一个在巴黎街头流浪的孩子，他没有家，没有亲人，没有鞋穿……可他的脸上总是挂着笑容，心中总是有歌儿在欢唱。

不过，我们要先从冉阿让讲起……





LES MISÉRABLES


France in the 1830s. The rich ride in carriages, and eat from gold plates. The poor have no work, no food, no hope – they are Les Misérables , and rebellion is in the air. France remembers the French Revolution in 1789, when the people built barricades in the streets of Paris, and the dead were counted in thousands. Is that time coming again?

This is the story of Jean Valjean. A prisoner for nineteen years, now at last he is a free man. But how can he live, where can he find work? What hope is there for a man like him? It is also the story of Javert, a police inspector, a cruel man, a hard man. He wants one thing in life – to send Valjean back to prison. And it is Fantine's story too, Fantine and her daughter Cosette. How does their story change Valjean's life? And it is also Marius's story. He is a student in Paris, ready to die for the rebellion – or for love. And last, there is Gavroche – a boy of the Paris streets, with no home, no family, no shoes... But a boy with a smile on his face and a song in his heart.

But we begin with Jean Valjean...

Jean Valjean


FOREWORD

It is the year 1796, and the people of France are hungry. Not the rich people, of course. They have food, they have warm clothes, they have beautiful houses. No, it is the poor people of France...

Jean Valjean is one of these poor people. He is a young man, big, strong, and a good worker – but he has no work, he cannot find work, and he is hungry. He lives with his sister in the village of Brie. Her husband is dead, and she has seven children. It is a cold hard winter, and there is no food in the house. No bread, nothing – and seven children!

Jean Valjean is a good man, he is not a thief. But how can a man just sit there, when his sister's children cry all night because they are hungry? What can a man do?

He leaves his house at night, and goes down the village street. He puts his hand through the window of the bakery – crash! – he takes a loaf of bread, and he runs. He runs fast, but other people run faster.

France is not kind to poor people. France sends Jean Valjean to prison for five years. After four years he escapes. They find him, and bring him back. They give him six more years. Once again, he escapes, and two days later, they find him. And they give him another eight years. Nineteen years in prison – for a loaf of bread!

In 1815, when he leaves prison, Jean Valjean is a different man. Prison changes people. Years of misery, years of back-breaking work, years of cruel prison guards. These things change a man. Once there was love in Jean Valjean's heart. Now, there is only hate.

One evening in October, in the year 1815, there was a knock on the door of the bishop of Digne's house.

'Come in,' said the bishop. The bishop was a kind man; everyone in the town of Digne knew that. Poor people, hungry people, miserable people – they all came to the door of the bishop's house.

The bishop's sister looked at the man at the door that night, and she was afraid.

'Look at him!' she whispered to the bishop. 'He is a big man, and a dangerous one. He carries a yellow card, so he was once a prisoner – a bad man.'

But the bishop did not listen. 'Come in, my friend,' he said to the man at the door. 'Come in. You must eat dinner with us, and sleep in a warm bed tonight.'

The man stared at the bishop. 'My name is Jean Valjean,' he said. 'I was a prisoner in Toulon for nineteen years. Here is my yellow card, see? People everywhere shut their doors in my face – but not you. Why not?'

'Because, my friend, in the eyes of God you are my brother,' said the bishop, smiling. 'So, come in, and sit by our fire.' The bishop turned to his sister. 'Now, sister, our friend Jean Valjean needs a good dinner. Bring out the silver dinner plates. It's a special night tonight.'

'Not the silver plates!' whispered the bishop's sister. Her eyes went quickly to Jean Valjean, then back to the bishop's face.

'Yes, the silver plates,' said the bishop. 'And the silver candlesticks too. The church has these beautiful things, but they are for our visitors. And our visitor tonight must have only the best.'

And so Jean Valjean sat down with the bishop and his sister and ate from silver plates. He ate hungrily – it was his first good meal for weeks.

'You're a good man,' he said to the bishop. 'Perhaps the only good man in France.'

But Valjean could not take his eyes away from the silver plates. After the meal, the bishop's sister put the silver plates away, and Valjean's eyes watched. He saw the place, and he remembered it.

Valjean could not take his eyes away from the silver plates.

Valjean could not take his eyes away from the silver plates.

In the night, in his warm bed in the bishop's house, he thought about the plates. They were big, heavy – so much silver in them! 'I can sell those plates,' he thought. 'For just one of them, I can eat well for months!'

Nineteen years in prison is a long time, and nineteen hard years change a man.

By morning Valjean was a long way from the bishop's house. But how do you carry big silver plates? How do you hide them? People in Digne began to whisper...

'Did you see him? That big man, carrying six silver plates? Where did he get them from, eh?'

'Those plates came from the church. A man like that doesn't have silver plates!'

'No! And he carries a yellow card, did you see? So he was a prisoner once. He's a thief – he stole those plates!'

The police heard the whispers. They went after Jean Valjean, found him, and took him back to the bishop's house in the afternoon. But there, they had a surprise.

'My dear friend!' the bishop said to Jean Valjean. 'I'm so pleased to see you. You forgot the candlesticks! I gave you the silver plates and the candlesticks, you remember? but you forgot to take the candlesticks when you left.'

'But this man is a thief!' said one of the policemen.

'No, no, of course not,' said the bishop, smiling. 'I gave the silver to Monsieur Valjean.'

'You mean he can go? He is free?' said the policeman.

'Of course,' the bishop said.

All this time Jean Valjean stared at the bishop, and said not one word. The policemen went away, and the Bishop of Digne went into his house and came out again with the two silver candlesticks. They were tall and heavy and beautiful. The bishop put the candlesticks into Jean Valjean's hands.

'Jean Valjean, my brother,' he said. 'You must leave your bad life behind you. This is God's silver, and I am giving it to you. With it, you can begin a new, good life. I am buying your soul for God.'

Jean Valjean left the town of Digne, with his silver plates and his silver candlesticks. Suddenly, he was a rich man, but he did not understand why.

'What's happening to me?' he thought. 'Everything is changing. How can I hate people when this bishop is so good to me? What shall I do? How shall I live?'

Prisoner Valjean did not understand anything. He sat down by the road, with his head in his hands, and cried. He cried for the first time in nineteen years.

How long did he sit there, crying? What did he do next, and where did he go? Nobody knows, but when the sun came up on a new day, he was a changed man.

冉阿让


引言

时为1796年，法国人民正在忍饥挨饿。当然，不包括那些富人。富人不缺食物，他们穿着暖和的衣服，住着漂亮的房子。法国的穷苦百姓却……

冉阿让是这些穷苦百姓中的一员。他年纪轻轻，块头大，身体壮，而且工作勤快——但是他没有工作，也找不到工作，只能饿着肚子。他和姐姐住在一个叫布里的村子里。姐姐死了丈夫，独自拉扯着七个孩子。这是一个严寒的冬天，家里没有吃的了。没有面包，什么都没有——却有七个孩子要养活！

冉阿让是个好人，他不是一个贼。但是，当姐姐的孩子们因为挨饿而整夜啼哭的时候，一个男子汉怎么能干坐在那儿呢？一个男子汉能做些什么呢？

他趁着夜色出了门，沿着村里的街道一直走。他打碎了面包店的橱窗——哗啦！然后伸手进去，拿起一条面包就跑。他跑得很快，但是有人跑得比他还快。

法国不是个善待穷人的国家。冉阿让被判了五年监禁。坐了四年牢之后，他越狱了。他们找到了他，把他抓了回来，又给他加了六年刑。他再次越狱，两天后，他们抓到了他，这一回又给他加了八年刑。他坐了十九年的牢——就为了一条面包！

1815年，冉阿让出狱的时候，已经不再是当初那个他了。监狱会改变一个人。年复一年的悲惨境遇，年复一年累垮脊背的苦力活儿，年复一年监狱看守的残酷虐待，这些都会改变一个人。从前，冉阿让的心里装的是爱。现在，他的心里只有恨。

1815年十月的一个晚上，迪涅主教的家门口响起了敲门声。

“请进。”主教说道。这位主教是个善良的人，住在迪涅镇上的每个人都知道。穷苦的人，挨饿的人，生活不幸的人——他们都会来敲主教家的门。

那天晚上，主教的妹妹看着门口的那个男人，心里感到害怕。

“瞧瞧他！”她低声对主教说道，“他是个危险的大个子。他身上带着一张黄卡，说明他曾经是个囚犯——一个恶棍。”

但是主教没有理会她的话。“进来吧，我的朋友。”他对门口的男人说，“进来吧。您一定要和我们一起吃顿晚饭，然后今晚在暖和的床铺上睡一宿。”

那个男人有些惊讶地看着主教。“我叫冉阿让。”他说，“我在土伦监狱坐了十九年牢。这是我的黄卡，看见没？不管我走到哪儿，他们都把我拒之门外，你却没这么做。为什么呢？”

“因为，我的朋友，在上帝的眼里，您就是我的兄弟。”主教微笑着说道，“所以，进来吧，坐在炉火旁边。”主教转头对他的妹妹说：“你瞧，妹妹，我们的朋友冉阿让需要好好地吃一顿晚餐。把银餐盘拿出来吧。这是个特别的夜晚。”

“别拿银餐盘！”主教的妹妹低声说道。她瞟了眼冉阿让，又转过头看着主教。

“就拿银餐盘。”主教说道，“再把银烛台也拿出来。教会拥有这些漂亮的东西，但它们是为我们的客人准备的。我们今晚就要拿最好的来招待客人。”

于是，冉阿让与主教和主教的妹妹一起坐到了餐桌旁，用银餐盘吃晚餐。他吃得狼吞虎咽——这是他几个星期以来吃到的第一顿像样的饭。

“你是一个好人。”他对主教说，“可能是法国唯一的好人。”

但冉阿让无法把目光从银餐盘上移开。吃过饭之后，主教的妹妹把银餐盘收了起来，冉阿让全都看在眼里。他看见了收餐盘的地方，并记住了位置。

晚上，躺在主教家暖和的床铺上时，他一直想着那些餐盘。它们又大又沉——肯定用了很多白银！“我可以把那些盘子卖了。”他心想，“只要卖一个，就足够我几个月好吃好喝了！”

狱中的十九年是很长一段时间，十九年的苦难会改变一个人。

到了早上，冉阿让已经离开主教家很远了。但是，怎么才能带着硕大的银餐盘上路呢？怎么才能把它们藏起来呢？迪涅镇的居民开始窃窃私语……

“你看见他了吗？那个背着六个银餐盘的大块头男人？他是从什么地方弄来那些餐盘的呢？”

“那些餐盘是教会的。他那种人根本就不会有银餐盘！”

“不是吧！他身上有张黄卡，你看见没？这么说他从前坐过牢。他是个贼——他偷了那些餐盘！”

警察听到了这些小声的议论。他们去追捕冉阿让，并抓到了他，下午的时候，警察把他带回了主教家。不过，到了那里，发生了一件令他们意想不到的事情。

“我亲爱的朋友！”主教对冉阿让说，“见到您真是太高兴了。您忘了拿那些烛台！我把银餐盘和 烛台都送给您了，您记得吗？可您走的时候忘记带走烛台了。”

“这个人可是个贼啊！”一个警察说道。

“不，不，当然不是。”主教微笑着说道，“银器是我送给 冉阿让先生的。”

“您的意思是他可以走了？他自由了？”警察说道。

“当然。”主教说。

整个过程中，冉阿让一直盯着主教，一言不发。警察走了以后，迪涅主教走进屋里，又拿着那两个银烛台走了出来。它们又高又沉，非常漂亮。主教把烛台交到了冉阿让的手里。

“冉阿让，我的弟兄，”他说，“您一定要把行恶的生活抛在身后。这是上帝的银器，现在我把它送给您。有了它，您可以开始诚实的新生活。我是在为上帝买您的灵魂。”

冉阿让带着他的银餐盘和银烛台离开了迪涅镇。突然之间，他变成了一个富人，却不知道为什么会这样。

“我这是怎么了？”他心想，“一切都变了。主教对我这么好，我怎么还能去恨别人呢？我应该做些什么？我应该怎样生活呢？”

囚犯冉阿让什么都想不明白。他坐在路边，双手抱着头哭了起来。他十九年来第一次哭了起来。

他坐在那里哭了多长时间？他接下来做了什么，去了哪里？没有人知道，但是新的一天太阳升起的时候，他成了一个改过自新的人。

Fantine


FOREWORD

Now we meet Fantine. She is young and beautiful, and in love with a man in Paris. But she has no family, and no money. For Fantine, this is the love of her life; for the man in Paris, it is just a summer of love.

Men are not kind to women. They have their fun, and then they walk away. The man in Paris goes home to his rich family, and leaves poor Fantine with a child, a little girl called Cosette. Fantine must find work, but how?

Fantine has a child but no husband, and a woman without a husband is nothing. Worse than nothing. People are not kind to a woman with a child but no husband. They turn their faces away, they close their doors, they say, 'There's no work here for a woman like you.'

you.'

Fantine loves her daughter dearly, but what can she do? So, in 1818, in a village near Paris, she leaves her little daughter with Monsieur and Madame Thénardier. They ask for seven francs a month. Fantine pays the money, holds her daughter in her arms for the last time, and leaves. She takes the road for her home town of Montreuil, and tears are running down her face. There is misery in her heart. Poor Fantine. Poor Cosette.

In Montreuil Fantine finds work in a factory. This is the factory of Monsieur Madeleine, an important man in the town, and very rich. Everybody likes him, because he is a good man. He is kind to his workers, he helps people, and his factory gives many jobs to the townspeople.

But who is he, this Monsieur Madeleine? Where did he come from? He arrived in Montreuil at the end of 1815, but nobody knows his family, or anything about him.

Fantine sent money every month to the Thénardiers. They were not good people, and they used the money for their own daughters. Poor little Cosette was a hungry, dirty, unloved child. She worked all day – she cleaned the house, she carried water, she washed the clothes. But Fantine knew nothing of this, and she worked long hours to make money for Cosette.

The next year the Thénardiers asked for twelve francs a month; the year after that, they wanted fifteen francs.

Then Fantine lost her job at the factory, because the women did not like her.

'She has a child, in a village somewhere near Paris.'

'Yes, and where's her husband? She doesn't have one!'

'We don't want that kind of woman here. She must go.'

Fantine found work making shirts. It was hard work for little money. She was often ill, with a small dry cough.

The Thénardiers wrote again: 'Your daughter needs a warm dress for winter. Send ten francs at once.'

Fantine did not have ten francs. She thought long and hard, and went to the barber in the town. She took off her hat, and her golden hair fell down her back.

'That's beautiful hair,' said the barber.

'What can you give me for it?'

'Ten francs.'

'Then cut it off.'

She sent the money to the Thénardiers. 'My daughter's not cold now,' she thought. 'she's wearing my hair.'

Soon another letter came from the Thénardiers: 'Send one hundred francs, or Cosette must leave our house.'

A hundred francs! How can a poor woman get that kind of money? There was only one way.

One cold winter evening, outside a restaurant in the centre of Montreuil, a woman walked up and down. There was snow on the ground, but the woman wore an evening dress, with flowers in her hair. Some young men came out of the restaurant, saw her, and began to call her bad names. They laughed and shouted, but the woman did not look at them. Then, one young man took some snow and put it down the back of the woman's dress.

The woman was Fantine. She gave a cry, turned, and hit the young man's face with her hands. People came to watch, laughing.

A tall policeman arrived, took the woman by the arm, and pulled her away. 'Come with me,' he said.

A tall policeman arrived, and pulled Fantine away.

A tall policeman arrived, and pulled Fantine away.

This policeman was inspector Javert. He was new to Montreuil, and he was a hard man. To him, the law was the only important thing in life, and he hated criminals.

The law in France at that time was not kind to women like Fantine. Javert took Fantine to the office of police.

'You hit a man in the street, and that's a crime,' he told her. 'You're getting six months.'

'Six months in prison?' Fantine cried. 'No! I'm not a bad woman, Monsieur, please! I must work, I need the money for my little daughter. Please, please don't send me to prison!' She fell to the floor, crying.

'Take her away,' Javert said to a policeman.

'One moment, please,' said a new voice.

Everybody turned to look at the door, and there stood the good, the great Monsieur Madeleine. He was an important man in Montreuil.

'Inspector,' he said. 'I was outside the restaurant too, and I can tell you the true story. The young man began the fight, and this poor woman' – he looked at Fantine on the floor – 'must go free. She did nothing wrong.'

'The woman is a criminal,' said Javert angrily. 'She——'

'She must go free,' said Monsieur Madeleine. 'Ask the other people at the restaurant. We all saw the same thing.'

Fantine stood up slowly. She began to cough, a hard dry noise. Monsieur Madeleine took her arm gently.

'My dear child, you are not well,' he said.

Javert's cold eyes stared at Monsieur Madeleine.

'Do I know you from somewhere?' he said. 'Were you ever at Toulon?'

Monsieur Madeleine looked at him. His face did not change, but his eyes were Suddenly very watchful. 'No, I don't know Toulon,' he said.

Monsieur Madeleine took Fantine to the little hospital in Montreuil. She lay in bed, and coughed and coughed. Monsieur Madeleine listened to her sad story, and the next day he sent money to the Thénardiers.

'Now, you must get better,' he told Fantine. 'Cosette needs you.'

But Fantine did not get better. She was now very ill, and five days later the doctor spoke to Monsieur Madeleine.

'Does she have a child, this poor woman?' he said.

'Yes, a small daughter.'

'You must bring the child here – soon.'

Monsieur Madeleine went to sit by Fantine's bed.

'Monsieur Madeleine' – cough, cough – 'you are so' – cough, cough – 'kind to me. I want to see my daughter, one last time. Please can you' – cough, cough, cough – 'bring Cosette to me? Please, Monsieur!'

'I want to see my daughter, one last time.'

'I want to see my daughter, one last time.'

Monsieur Madeleine took her hand. 'Of course I can,' he said gently, 'and then——'

The door of the room Suddenly opened behind him, and Fantine cried out, 'No! No!'

Monsieur Madeleine looked round quickly. Inspector Javert came into the room, with four policemen.

'Jean Valjean, prisoner at Toulon, I am arresting you,' Javert said. 'After you left the prison, you stole money from a child in Toulon. You are still a thief, and now you must go to prison for life.'

Fantine sat up in bed. 'No!' she cried. 'Cosette...!'

Monsieur Madeleine stood up slowly. 'Inspector, give me three days,' he said. He was a big man, much bigger than Javert. 'Three days, to bring this poor woman's child to her before she dies. Then you can take me.'

'Inspector, give me three days,' Monsieur Madeleine said.

'Inspector, give me three days,' Monsieur Madeleine said.

Javert laughed loudly. 'Three days! You're going to run away!'

Behind the two men, Fantine cried out, 'Monsieur Madeleine, please take care of Cosette, oh please...'

Javert turned to her. 'Be quiet, woman! There's no Monsieur Madeleine here. This man is a criminal, called Jean Valjean, and he's going to prison!'

Fantine stared at Javert, and tried to speak, but she could not. She fell back in the bed, and lay still.

She was dead.

The people of Montreuil talked about that day for a long time – the death of the woman Fantine, the arrest of Monsieur Madeleine. Javert put Monsieur Madeleine in a locked room in the police office, but in the night he broke down the door and escaped. Where did he go? Did he go to his house in the town? His old servant said no. She saw nobody, and heard nothing, she said. (She loved Monsieur Madeleine very much.)

So where did Monsieur Madeleine go? Nobody in Montreuil saw him again. One thing was certain. In Monsieur Madeleine's house there were two beautiful old silver candlesticks. The next day, they were gone.

芳汀


引言

现在让我们来说说芳汀。她年轻漂亮，在巴黎爱上了一个男人。但是她没有家人，也没有钱。对芳汀来说，这是她一生挚爱；对那个巴黎男人来说，这只是一段夏日恋曲。

男人总是狠心地对待女人。他们玩乐够了，就甩手走了。那个巴黎男人回到了他富有的家庭，留下可怜的芳汀一个人带着个孩子，一个叫珂赛特的小女孩。芳汀必须找到工作，可怎么找呢？

芳汀有个孩子，却没有丈夫，而没有丈夫的女人什么都不是——比什么都不是还糟。对带着孩子却没有丈夫的女人，人们向来不肯发发善心。他们扭过脸去，关上家门，说：“这里没有工作给像你这样 的女人。”

芳汀非常疼爱自己的女儿，可是她能做什么呢？于是，1818年，在巴黎附近的一个小村子里，她把年幼的女儿交给了德纳第夫妇照顾。他们要芳汀一个月付七法郎。芳汀给了钱，最后一次把女儿抱在怀里，然后离开了。她踏上回家乡蒙特勒伊的路，眼泪顺着面颊流了下来。她满心痛苦。可怜的芳汀，可怜的珂赛特。

芳汀在蒙特勒伊的一家工厂找到了工作。这是马德兰先生开的工厂。他是镇上的大人物，非常有钱。所有人都喜欢他，因为他是一个好人。他善待厂里的工人，扶危济困，他的工厂还为镇民提供了许多工作机会。

但是，这个马德兰先生到底是谁呢？他打哪儿来？他是1815年的年底来到蒙特勒伊的，可没有人知道他的家庭情况，或是任何关于他的事。

芳汀每个月都给德纳第夫妇寄钱。他们不是好人，把钱都花在了自己的女儿身上。可怜的小珂赛特又饿又脏，没人疼爱。她从早到晚地干活儿——打扫屋子，提水，洗衣。可芳汀对此一无所知，她每天起早贪黑地工作，只为了赚钱给珂赛特。

到了第二年，德纳第夫妇每个月索要十二法郎；又过了一年，他们张口要十五法郎。

后来芳汀丢掉了工厂里的工作，因为女工们都不喜欢她。

“她有个孩子，养在巴黎附近的一个村子。”

“是呀。她的丈夫在哪里？她没有丈夫！”

“我们这里不要这样的女人。她必须走人。”

芳汀找了份缝制衬衫的工作。这份工作非常辛苦，收入却少得可怜。她常常生病，还伴有轻微的干咳。

德纳第夫妇又写信来了：“你的女儿需要一件暖和的衣裙过冬。马上寄十法郎来。”

芳汀没有十法郎。她苦恼了很久，最后上了镇上的理发店。她摘下帽子，满头的金发垂落下来。

“这头发真漂亮。”理发师说。

“卖给你的话能给我多少钱？”

“十法郎。”

“那就把它剪了吧。”

她把钱寄给了德纳第夫妇。“我的女儿现在不会挨冻了。”她心想，“她穿着我用头发换来的衣服。”

没过多久，德纳第夫妇又写来一封信：“寄一百法郎来，不然珂赛特就别想住在我们家了。”

一百法郎！一个穷困的女人怎么才能弄到这么一笔钱呢？只有一个办法了。

一个寒冷的冬夜，有个女人在蒙特勒伊镇中心的一家餐馆外面走来走去。地上还有积雪，可那个女人却只穿了一件晚礼服，发间插着花。几名年轻男子从餐馆里走了出来，他们看见了她，开始对她骂骂咧咧。他们又是笑又是嚷，可女人并没有朝他们看。这时，一个年轻男子抓了一把雪，塞进了女人后背的衣服里。

这个女人正是芳汀。她“啊”的一声叫了出来，转过身子，挥手打了那个年轻男子的脸。人们上前围观，哄笑声一片。

一个高个子警察赶了过来，抓住女人的胳膊，把她拉开了。“跟我走。”他说道。

这个警察是沙威督察。他是个冷酷无情的人，刚刚才调到蒙特勒伊。对他来说，法律是生活中唯一重要的事情，他痛恨罪犯。

在那个时代，法国的法律对芳汀这样的女人是毫不容情的。沙威把芳汀带到了警局。

“你在大街上打了一个男人，这是犯罪行为。”他对她说，“你要坐六个月的牢。”

“坐六个月牢？”芳汀哭喊道，“不行啊！我不是个坏女人，先生，求求您！我必须工作，我需要赚钱来养活我的小女儿。求求您，求求您不要送我进监狱！”她瘫倒在地上哭了起来。

“把她带走。”沙威对一名警察说。

“请等一下。”这时响起了另一个声音。

大家都转过头去看着门口，门口站着的是善良、威严的马德兰先生。他是蒙特勒伊镇上的大人物。

“督察，”他说道，“我当时也在餐馆外面，可以告诉您事情的真实情况。是那个年轻人先挑事儿的，而这个可怜的女人”——他看着地上的芳汀——“您必须放了她。她没有做错任何事。”

“这女人是个罪犯。”沙威愤怒地说道，“她——”

“您必须放了她。”马德兰先生说，“问问餐馆的其他人。我们都看到了那一幕。”

芳汀慢慢站了起来。她开始咳嗽，是很厉害的干咳。马德兰先生轻轻扶住了她的胳膊。

“我亲爱的孩子，你生病了。”他说。

沙威一双冷酷的眼睛紧盯着马德兰先生。

“我以前在哪儿见过您吗？”他说，“您到过土伦吗？”

马德兰先生看着他。他脸上的神情没有任何变化，眼神却突然变得警惕起来。“不，我不知道土伦这个地方。”他说。

马德兰先生把芳汀带到了蒙特勒伊的小医院。她躺在床上，咳个不停。马德兰先生听她讲了自己辛酸的故事，第二天，他就给德纳第夫妇寄去了钱。

“好了，你一定要好起来。”他对芳汀说，“珂赛特需要你。”

可是芳汀没能好起来。她这时已病得很重。五天之后，大夫找了马德兰先生谈话。

“这个可怜的女人是不是有个孩子？”他问道。

“是的，有一个年幼的女儿。”

“您必须把这个孩子带到这儿来——要快。”

马德兰先生走到芳汀的病床边坐了下来。

“马德兰先生”——咳，咳—— “您真是”——咳，咳—— “对我太好了。我想见见我的女儿，最后一面。求求您，您能”——咳，咳，咳—— “把珂赛特带来见我吗？求求您了，先生！”

马德兰先生握住她的手。“我当然会把她带来，”他温和地说，“到那时候——”

房间的门在他身后猛地打开了，芳汀喊道：“不！不！”

马德兰先生迅速转身看去。沙威督察带着四个警察走进了房间。

“冉阿让，土伦的囚犯，我来逮捕你。”沙威说，“离开监狱之后，你在土伦偷了一个孩子的钱。你仍然是一个贼，现在你要坐上一辈子的牢。”

芳汀从床上坐了起来。“不！”她喊道，“珂赛特……！”

马德兰先生慢慢站起了身。“督察，给我三天时间。”他说。他身材高大，比沙威要高大许多。“就三天，我要在这个可怜的女人死前，带她的孩子来见她。之后您可以把我抓走。”

沙威大声笑了起来：“三天！你是想要逃跑！”

在这两个男人身后，芳汀哭着说：“马德兰先生，求您照顾珂赛特，哦，求求您……”

沙威把脸转向她：“闭嘴，女人！这里没有什么马德兰先生。这个男人是个罪犯，他叫冉阿让，他就要进监狱了！”

芳汀看着沙威，她想要开口，却说不出话来。她倒在床上，一动也不动。

她死了。

很长一段时间里，蒙特勒伊的人们都在谈论那天发生的事——那个名叫芳汀的女人的死和马德兰先生的被捕。沙威把马德兰先生锁在警局的一个房间里，可是那天夜里，马德兰先生撞开了门，逃跑了。他去哪儿了呢？他是不是跑回了镇上自己的家里？他的老仆人说没见到他。她说，她谁都没看见，什么都没听见。（她非常敬爱马德兰先生。）

那么，马德兰先生去了哪里呢？蒙特勒伊的居民再也没有见过他。有一件事是清楚无疑的。在马德兰先生的家里有两个漂亮的旧银烛台。第二天，它们不见了。

Cosette


FOREWORD

Monsieur Madeleine is, of course, Jean Valjean. You knew that already. After Digne, he sells the bishop's silver plates (but keeps the candlesticks). He comes to Montreuil, builds his factory, works hard, is kind to other people... He makes a new, good life, and is true to the Bishop of Digne.

But after Valjean left prison in Toulon, and before he came to Digne, he was hungry. And in a street in Toulon he stole some money from a boy. Just one franc... to buy bread. Because he did this, the law in France says that prisoner Valjean must go back to prison, and stay there for life. He can never be a free man again.

And so we meet Javert. Before Montreuil, he was a prison guard at Toulon. The law is his god, and he hates all criminals. He remembers Jean Valjean, that big strong man, very well. He wants to see him in prison again. And he, Inspector Javert, is going to put him there.

Jean Valjean remembers Javert now. He remembers the cold eyes, the hard voice, the cruel prison guard's smile. He remembers... And is afraid. He knows that Javert is his enemy for life.

But he remembers Fantine too. He remembers her dying words – Please take care of Cosette, please... How can he leave this little girl, without a mother, without a friend in the world? He must find her – Javert, or no Javert.

Monsieur and Madame Thénardier lived in a village called Montfermeil near Paris. There was no water in the village, and the nearest water was a small river in a wood fifteen minutes' walk away. People carried the water in buckets to their houses.

Cosette hated that wood. At night, the trees made noises. She was frightened of the noises, frightened of the dark, and with a heavy bucket of water, it was a long walk home.

One dark winter night in 1823, Madame Thénardier sent Cosette out to the river for water. Cosette ran to the river and then, with her heavy bucket of water, she began to walk home. The trees were noisy tonight, whispering and laughing at her, and the little girl began to cry.

'Oh please God, help me! Please, dear God!'

And suddenly, the bucket was gone. A great hand came down and took it from her. She looked up and saw a big man in an old yellow coat.

A great hand came down and took the bucket from her.

A great hand came down and took the bucket from her.

Sometimes we know, without words, when something good is happening. The little girl knew that now, and she was not frightened of the big man, not a bit.

The man spoke to her. 'Child, this is a very heavy bucket. Shall I carry it for you?'

'Yes, Monsieur.'

'How old are you?'

'I'm eight years old, Monsieur.'

'Where is your mother?'

'I don't know,' said the child. 'I haven't got a mother.'

'What's your name?'

'Cosette.'

The big man stopped. He put the bucket down and looked into Cosette's face.

'Why are you carrying a heavy bucket of water at this time of night? Who sent you?'

'Madame Thénardier.'

'I would like to talk to this Madame Thénardier. Shall we go and see her?'

'Yes, Monsieur.'

Cosette was not afraid of the tree noises now. This big man, with his gentle voice, was a new and wonderful thing in her life. They walked to the Thénardiers' house.

'Please, Monsieur, can I carry the bucket now?'

'But why?'

'I can't ask people for help, Madame says. She hits me when I do that,' Cosette said. 'she hits me all the time.'

He gave her the bucket.

The Thénardiers were very surprised to see Cosette's new friend, this big man in the old yellow coat.

Inside the house, the big man looked at Cosette. He saw her thin clothes, her dirty hair, her big frightened eyes. She was small for her eight years. Her hands were red from kitchen work, and she had no shoes.

'Why does this child have no shoes on her feet, on this cold winter night?' he said to Madame Thénardier.

Madame Thénardier looked at Cosette angrily. 'Go into the kitchen, Cosette. There is work to do. Go!'

'And who are you? ' Monsieur Thénardier said.

'I am here for Fantine, the child's mother,' said the big man. 'You don't need to know my name. Fantine is dead, so you can get no more money from her. Here' – he put some money on the table – 'is 1500 francs. Now call the child. I'm taking her away.'

When Jean Valjean and Cosette left Montfermeil, Cosette did not look back. She never wanted to see Madame Thénardier again.

She put her cold little hand into Valjean's great hand, and looked up into his face. 'Monsieur,' she said, 'can I... can I call you Father?'

Valjean looked down at her big round eyes. 'Yes,' he said. He did not know love, he did not understand love, but in that moment, suddenly, he felt a father's love for this small child.

'Yes,' he said again. 'Yes, you can call me Father. It's a good name.'

Hand in hand, they walked away on the road to Paris.

In Paris Cosette learnt to laugh, and to sing like a bird, and to be happy. Jean Valjean learnt to be father and mother to this child, and he loved her dearly.

But they lived quietly, moved house often, and only went out at night. Because Javert, too, was in Paris. When Valjean escaped from Montreuil, Javert came to Paris to look for him. He was now an important inspector in the Paris police. Every criminal in Paris was afraid of inspector Javert.

Once, Valjean saw Javert by the river, and the next day he looked for a new place to live. He found one, behind the high walls of a girls' school. The school gave Valjean a job as a gardener, and he lived in a little house in the big gardens. Cosette lived in the school. But every day she came to the gardener's little house for one hour. They talked, and they sang, and they read books. It was the happiest hour in the day for her and for Jean Valjean.

And so the years passed.

珂赛特


引言

马德兰先生当然就是冉阿让。这你已经知道了。离开迪涅之后，他把主教的银餐盘卖了（但是留下了烛台）。他来到蒙特勒伊，建起了自己的工厂，辛苦工作，对人友善……他过上了诚实的新生活，成为了迪涅主教期望他成为的那种人。

但在冉阿让离开土伦监狱、还没到迪涅之前，他一直饿着肚子。在土伦的一条街上，他从一个男孩那里偷了些钱。就一法郎……为了买面包吃。就因为他干了这件事，法国的法律规定囚犯冉阿让必须再进监狱，坐一辈子的牢。他再也不可能获得自由了。

于是我们遇到了沙威。来蒙特勒伊之前，他是土伦的一个监狱看守。法律是他的上帝，他痛恨一切罪犯。他对那个人高马大的壮汉冉阿让记得一清二楚。他一心想要看到他再进监狱。而他，沙威督察，一定会把他送进牢里的。

冉阿让现在也记起了沙威。他认得那双冷酷的眼睛、严厉的声音，以及这个残忍的监狱看守脸上的笑容。他记得……而且他感到害怕。他知道沙威是他这辈子的死敌。

但是他也记得芳汀。他记得她临死前的话——求您照顾珂赛特，求求您 ……这个小女孩没有了妈妈，在这世上也没有一个朋友，他怎么能丢下她不管呢？他必须找到她——管他沙威不沙威。

求您照顾珂赛特，求求您

德纳第先生和夫人住在巴黎附近一个叫孟费 的村子里。村子里没有水源，最近的水源是树林里的一条小河，离村子有十五分钟的路程。村民都要拎桶打水回家。

珂赛特痛恨那个树林。夜晚，树木发出声响。珂赛特害怕那种声响，害怕黑暗。她手里拎着沉沉的一桶水，令回家的路变得很漫长。

1823年一个漆黑的冬夜，德纳第夫人叫珂赛特到河边去打水。珂赛特跑到河边，打了水后，拎着沉沉的水桶往家走。今天晚上树木发出的声音很响，它们在一边低语，一边嘲笑她，这个小女孩开始哭了起来。

“噢，上帝啊，求您救救我吧！求您了，亲爱的上帝！”

突然，她手里的水桶不见了。一只大手伸了过来，把水桶接了过去。她抬起头来，看见一个穿着黄色旧外套的大个子男人。

有时候，不用说话我们也会知道好事正降临在自己身上。小女孩现在就有这种预感，她不害怕这个大个子男人，一点儿也不。

那个男人开口跟她说话：“孩子，这桶水很沉啊。我来帮你拎，好吗？”

“好的，先生。”

“你几岁了？”

“我八岁了，先生。”

“你的妈妈在哪儿呢？”

“我不知道。”这孩子说道，“我没有妈妈。”

“你叫什么名字？”

“珂赛特。”

那个大个子男人停下了脚步。他放下水桶，审视珂赛特的脸。

“天这么晚了，你为什么还要拎这么沉的一桶水？谁让你去打水的？”

“德纳第夫人。”

“我想和这个德纳第夫人谈谈。我们去找她，好吗？”

“好的，先生。”

珂赛特现在不再害怕树木发出的声响了。这个说话声音温柔的大个子男人，成了她生命中一件美好的新事物。他们走到德纳第夫妇的房子前。

“先生，现在让我来拎水桶，好吗？”

“可为什么呢？”

“夫人说，我不能叫别人帮忙。我要是叫人帮忙，她就会打我。”珂赛特说。“她常常打我。”

他把水桶给了她。

见到珂赛特的新朋友，这个穿着黄色旧外套的大个子男人，德纳第夫妇非常吃惊。

进了屋子，这个大个子男人打量起珂赛特来。他看见她衣衫单薄，头发肮脏，一双惊恐的眼睛睁得大大的。她看起来比寻常八岁的孩子瘦小，双手因为一直在厨房里干活儿而变得通红，脚上连鞋子都没有。

“冬天这么冷的晚上，这个孩子为什么没有鞋穿？”他问德纳第夫人。

德纳第夫人气冲冲地瞪着珂赛特：“到厨房去，珂赛特。还有活儿要干。快去！”

“你 是谁？”德纳第先生问道。

“我是替孩子的母亲芳汀来的。”大个子男人说，“你不需要知道我的名字。芳汀死了，你们从她那里再也弄不到钱了。这个给你们”——他把一些钱放在桌子上——“这是1500法郎。现在把孩子叫来，我要把她带走。”

冉阿让和珂赛特离开孟费 村的时候，珂赛特没有回头望。她再也不想见到德纳第夫人了。

她把自己冰冷的小手放进冉阿让的大手里，抬头看着他的脸。“先生，”她说，“我能……我能叫你爸爸吗？”

冉阿让低头望着她那双圆圆的大眼睛。“可以。”他说。他不知道什么是爱，也不懂爱，可是在那一刻，他突然感受到了对这个小孩父亲般的爱。

“可以，”他再次说道，“可以，你可以叫我爸爸。听起来真不错。”

他们手拉着手，上路往巴黎而去。

在巴黎，珂赛特学会了欢笑，学会了像小鸟一样歌唱，学会了快乐。冉阿让学会了当起这个孩子的父母，他非常疼爱她。

不过，他们过着不引人注意的生活，常常搬家，并且只在天黑之后外出。这都是因为沙威也在巴黎。冉阿让从蒙特勒伊逃走之后，沙威就来到巴黎追捕他。他现在是巴黎警局中一位重要的督察。巴黎的每个罪犯都害怕沙威督察。

有一次，冉阿让在河边看见了沙威，他第二天就去找新住处。他在一所女子学校的高墙内找到了住处。学校雇了冉阿让当花匠，他就住进了大花园里的一座小屋。珂赛特住在学校里。不过，她每天都会到花匠的小屋呆一个小时。他们一起聊天，一起唱歌，一起看书。对她和冉阿让来说，这是一天中最幸福的时光。

就这样，一年一年过去了。

Marius


FOREWORD

Nine years pass. Valjean and Cosette are living in the Rue Plumet in Paris, in a house with a big garden. It is a quiet street and nobody comes there. This pleases Valjean, because he is still afraid of Inspector Javert.

Cosette is now a young woman. She is tall, with golden-brown hair. She is beautiful, but there are many beautiful faces in the world. The wonderful thing about Cosette's face is her smile – a slow, warm, gentle smile, like sunlight after rain.

And now we must meet Marius, and his young friend Gavroche. Marius is a student, a young man with many ideas but no money. Paris is full of young men like this. Marius has a grandfather (his father is dead), but he does not talk to him. Their political ideas are very different. At seventeen, he leaves home with 30 francs, his watch, and a small bag of clothes. Now, five years older, he lives with other students, and they talk all night about books and ideas, politics and government, life and death. All students are like this. They live for ideas, and do a little work here and there. When they need to.

Gavroche is a child of the Paris streets. He is eleven or twelve years old, and wears a man's trousers and a woman's shirt (a kind woman gave these clothes to him). He lives on the streets, knows everybody, goes everywhere, and enjoys life. Well, why not? He knows no other life, only this one.

Marius loved walking through the streets and gardens of Paris, and he often walked in the Luxembourg garden. One day in the garden he saw a man with a young girl. The man was about sixty, and the girl, Marius thought, was about seventeen. He did not see her eyes, but he saw her golden-brown hair and her slow gentle smile.

He walked past them once, and did not look back. But he came to the Luxembourg the next day, and the day after that, and for the next five days. The man and the girl were always there. He could not stop looking at the girl. He wanted very much to see that smile again.

On the seventh day the girl turned her head and looked at Marius. She looked into his eyes across the garden, and that look went, like a bullet from a gun, into Marius's heart. There were no words, but at once Marius knew and the girl knew. This was love.

Life stopped for Marius then. He spent hours in the Luxembourg, and every time he saw her, the sun came out and all the birds in the garden began singing.

But the man began to look at Marius too, and his face was not friendly. Marius was afraid, and he went to Gavroche.

'Gavroche, please, you must help me.'

'Why? What's the matter, Monsieur Marius?'

'There's a girl, Gavroche. She walks in the Luxembourg every day. I want you to follow her home and tell me the address.'

'Why don't you follow her? I'm busy,' said Gavroche.

'I'm afraid to,' said Marius. 'Her father, grandfather, I don't know, is watching me. He doesn't like me.'

'Why is this important, Monsieur Marius?' Gavroche said. He had a big smile on his face.

'Why is this important, Monsieur Marius?' asked Gavroche.

'Why is this important, Monsieur Marius?' asked Gavroche.

'Because I'm IN LOVE,' shouted Marius. 'Please, Gavroche, do it!'

Gavroche ran away, laughing. Two days later he came to Marius's rooms.

'Rue Plumet,' he said. 'House at the end of the street. Hard to find. You need to look for it.'

Spring came, and Cosette began to go out into the garden at Rue Plumet. She was usually alone. Her old servant, Toussaint, was always in the kitchen, and Father (Jean Valjean) was in his room, reading.

Cosette was sad. She remembered the young man in the Luxembourg garden, but Father no longer wanted to go there. But that evening in the Rue Plumet garden, something very wonderful happened.

She heard a voice, a man's voice. She looked round, and it was him.

'I'm so sorry,' he said. 'Please don't be afraid. I just wanted to... You remember the Luxembourg garden? I saw you there for the first time... I can't forget you, day and night I think about you... Please don't be afraid... You see, I love you... It just happened to me... I can't stop it... Don't be afraid... please.'

Cosette listened to this wonderful river of words, and then held out her hand to him. He took her hand, and she pulled it to her, and put it against her heart.

'Then – you love me?' he said.

'Of course! You know that.'

A kiss. No words. They did not need words. Later, words came. The story of his life, the story of her life, everything. Between lovers, everything is interesting.

When they were done with words, Cosette put her head on Marius's shoulder and asked:

'What is your name?'

'My name is Marius. And yours?'

'Cosette.'

Every evening they met secretly in the garden at Rue Plumet. A kiss, a gentle laugh, whispered words of love – it was the spring and summer of their young lives.

It was the spring and summer of their young lives.

It was the spring and summer of their young lives.

But around them, outside their garden, there was change. There were angry people; there were police and soldiers on the streets of Paris. And one day Jean Valjean said to Cosette, 'My dearest child, we live in dangerous times. We must leave France and go to England.'

Cosette looked at him with frightened eyes. 'Must we go, Father?' she said.

Valjean watched her face. 'We must,' he said. 'Get ready to leave very soon.'

There was a change in Cosette. Valjean remembered the young man in the Luxembourg garden, and he looked at Cosette's beautiful young face. He was afraid – afraid of losing his dear daughter.

That evening in the Rue Plumet garden, there were many unhappy tears.

'But you must follow us to England,' cried Cosette.

'How can I do that?' cried Marius. 'I have no money, no passport even! England to me is like the moon!'

They held hands in the moonlight.

'Listen. I have an idea,' Marius said slowly. 'Wait two days. Perhaps...'

'Two days?' cried Cosette. 'How can I live two days without you?'

马吕斯


引言

九年过去了。冉阿让和珂赛特如今住在巴黎卜吕梅街一所带大花园的房子里。这是条僻静的街道，没有人到这儿来。这一点让冉阿让很满意，因为他仍然怕被沙威督察发现。

珂赛特现在已经是个大姑娘了。她个子高挑，一头金褐色的头发。她容貌美丽，不过这个世界上的漂亮脸蛋儿多得是，而珂赛特的脸庞吸引人的地方在于她的笑容——慢慢绽放、带着暖意的温柔笑容，就像雨后的阳光。

现在我们必须来介绍一下马吕斯和他年轻的朋友伽弗洛什。马吕斯是个学生，他是个很有想法的年轻人，可是却没有钱。巴黎到处都是这样的年轻人。马吕斯的祖父还在（他的父亲已经过世了），但他们不说话——他们的政治观点天差地别。17岁那年，他带着30法郎、自己的表和一小包衣服离开了家。现在，五年过去了，他和其他学生住在一起，他们彻夜畅谈书籍和信念、政治和政府、生和死。所有的学生都是这样。他们为信念而生，只在需要的时候，东家西家地打点零工。

伽弗洛什是个在巴黎街头流浪的孩子。他十一二岁，穿着一条男式长裤和一件女式衬衣（这些衣服是一位好心的妇人送给他的）。街头就是他的家，每一个人他都认识，每个地方他都去过，每天他都过得快快活活。是啊，为什么不呢？他没有过过其他的生活，他所知道的生活就是这样。

马吕斯喜欢穿行于巴黎的街道和公园，他常常在卢森堡公园散步。有一天，在卢森堡公园里，他见到一个男人和一个年轻女孩。那个男人60岁上下，而那个女孩，马吕斯心想，大概17岁吧。他没有看到她的眼睛，但他看到了她金褐色的头发和慢慢绽放的温柔笑容。

有一次，他从他们身边走过，不过他没有回头。可是第二天，他又来到了卢森堡公园，再下一天也来了，接下来的五天都来了。那个男人和女孩总是在公园里。他无法把目光从女孩的身上挪开。他非常想再见到那个笑容。

到了第七天，女孩转过头看着马吕斯。她的目光从公园的另一端投来，就像从枪口射出的一颗子弹，射进了马吕斯的心房。他们彼此无言，但马吕斯和女孩同时意识到，这 就是爱。

马吕斯的生活自此定格。他长时间地呆在卢森堡公园内，每一次见到她，太阳便破云而出，公园里的鸟儿也开始歌唱。

但是那个男人也开始注意到马吕斯，他脸上的表情并不友好。马吕斯有些怕他，于是他去找伽弗洛什。

“伽弗洛什，求求你，你一定要帮帮我。”

“为了什么呀？怎么回事，马吕斯先生？”

“我遇到了个女孩，伽弗洛什。她每天都在卢森堡公园散步。我想让你跟着她回家，再把她的地址告诉我。”

“你 为什么不去跟呢？我忙着呢。”伽弗洛什说。

“我害怕。”马吕斯说，“她的父亲——还是祖父，我也说不准——在盯着我。他不喜欢我。”

“这有什么大不了的，马吕斯先生？”伽弗洛什说。他的脸上绽开了灿烂的笑容。

“因为我恋爱了 。”马吕斯大声说道，“拜托，伽弗洛什，你就帮我这个忙吧！”

伽弗洛什笑着跑开了。两天后，他来到马吕斯的住处。

“在卜吕梅街。”他说，“街道尽头的房子。很难找。你得仔细找才行。”

春天来了，珂赛特开始到卜吕梅街的花园里去。她通常都是一个人去。她的老仆人杜桑总是在厨房里忙活，爸爸（冉阿让）则在自己的房间里看书。

珂赛特闷闷不乐。她回想起卢森堡公园里的那个小伙子，可是爸爸不愿再到那里去了。但是，就在那天傍晚，在卜吕梅街的花园里，一件非常美妙的事情发生了。

她听到了一个声音，一个男人的声音。她四下张望，原来是他。

“真是非常抱歉。”他说，“请不要害怕。我只是想……你还记得卢森堡公园吗？我是在那里第一次见到你的……我忘不了你，日日夜夜都在想着你……千万别害怕……我想说，我爱你……爱情就这么发生在我身上了……我控制不住……别害怕……求求你。”

珂赛特耳听着他倾诉不绝的动人话语，然后向他伸出了自己的手。他抓住她的手，她又把他的手拉向自己，放在胸口上。

“那么说——你爱我？”他说。

“当然！你知道的。”

一个亲吻。没有话语。他们不需要话语。亲吻过后，他们才聊起来。他从小到大的生活，她从小到大的生活，无话不谈。对热恋中的情人来说，什么话题都有趣。

等到他们终于把要说的话都说完了，珂赛特把头靠在马吕斯的肩头，问道：

“你叫什么名字？”

“我叫马吕斯。你呢？”

“珂赛特。”

每天傍晚，他们都在卜吕梅街的花园里秘密会面。一个亲吻，一声轻笑，呢喃的情话——这是两个年轻人生命中的春天和夏天。

可是，在他们周围，在他们的花园围墙之外，世界正在发生变化。民怨汹汹；军警进驻巴黎街头。一天，冉阿让对珂赛特说：“我最亲爱的孩子，我们生活在充满危险的时代。我们必须离开法国，到英格兰去。”

珂赛特看着他，眼睛里满是惊恐。“我们一定要走吗，爸爸？”她问。

冉阿让望着她的脸。“一定要走。”他说，“先收拾好东西，我们很快就出发。”

珂赛特变了。冉阿让记起了卢森堡公园里的那个小伙子，他看着珂赛特年轻美丽的面孔。他害怕——害怕失去自己亲爱的女儿。

那天傍晚，在卜吕梅街的花园里，洒下了许多悲伤的眼泪。

“可你一定要跟我们到英格兰去。”珂赛特哭着说。

“我怎么去得了呢？”马吕斯呜咽道，“我没有钱，连护照都没有！对我来说，去英格兰就像登天一样难！”

他们在月光下手拉着手。

“听着，我有个主意。”马吕斯慢慢说道，“等两天。也许……”

“两天？”珂赛特哭了出来，“没有了你，我怎么挨过两天呢？”

Love and Rrebellion


FOREWORD

So, what is Marius's idea? It is this... He wants to marry Cosette, but he has no money. His grandfather has money. He must ask his grandfather... But his grandfather is an old man, and old men's ideas do not change easily. He shouts at Marius, Marius shouts back, and that is the end of that. The next evening he goes as usual to the Rue Plumet. There is nobody in the garden, the house is dark, the windows are closed – Cosette and her father are gone.

Marius cannot live without Cosette. He wants to die, but Gavroche tells him that his friends need him. It is June 1832, and students and workers are running through the streets of Paris, bringing rebellion to the city, and everyone must fight the government. Marius is soon at the barricades, with a gun in his hand. He is happy. Death can come at any moment with a bullet from a soldier's gun.

These are dangerous times. Jean Valjean sees Inspector Javert in a street near the Rue Plumet. What is he doing there? Are the police watching his house? Valjean does not wait. The same night he and Cosette leave Rue Plumet. They move to 7 Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and begin to get ready for England.

How can love find a way in these troubled times?

When the soldiers attacked in front of the arsenal building, the people turned and ran, this way and that way, through the streets of the city. Marius and his friends came to the rue de la Chanvrerie and they built their barricade there. It was two metres high, made of wood and stone. Behind their barricade, the rebels waited for the soldiers. Night came, but nothing happened.

Enjolras was the leader of the students. He called Gavroche to him.

'You're small,' he said. 'Nobody sees you. Go and have a look round the city, and then bring us any news.'

Just after midnight, Gavroche was back. 'The soldiers aren't moving,' he said. 'But there are a lot of them.' He stopped Suddenly and whispered, 'Hey, who's that? That tall man, over there?'

Enjolras and Marius turned to look.

'I don't know him,' said Marius.

'People are coming and going all night,' said Enjolras. 'Why, Gavroche? Do you know him?'

'Yes,' whispered Gavroche. 'He's not one of us. He's a spy, a police spy. Name of Javert. He stopped me once, down by the river. Put me in prison all night.'

'Are you certain about this, Gavroche?' said Marius.

'I'm certain, all right,' said Gavroche. 'He's a spy!'

The rebels did not like spies. Four of Enjolras's men jumped on Javert, pulled him into the tavern behind the barricade, and tied him to the wall.

'Do we shoot him now?' asked one of the men.

'Later,' said Enjolras. 'He can wait.'

They went back outside to the barricade and listened for the sound of soldiers. Gavroche found Marius at the far end of the barricade.

'Marius,' he whispered, 'on my way back here I came past your rooms and went in.'

'Why?' whispered Marius.

'I was hungry,' said Gavroche. 'The woman in your house is nice – she always gives me something to eat. But she had a letter for you. She gave it to me. It came two days ago, she said.'

'A letter? a letter from whom?' Suddenly there was hope in Marius's heart. 'Quick – give it to me.'

The letter was from Cosette.

My dearest, Father says we must leave at once. We go tonight to 7 Rue de l'Homme-Armé, and soon to England. Oh my dear, how can I live without you? Cosette

Marius read this letter four times and then kissed it. She still loved him! He must write back to her and say his last goodbye. There was still no sound of soldiers in the street. He found some paper and a pencil.

Cosette, dearest. I came to the Rue Plumet, but you were gone already. We cannot marry. I went to my grandfather, and he said no. I have no money, and you have no money. I love you. I can never forget you. The fighting begins here very soon. When I am dead, don't be sad. Our love was beautiful. Marius

He called to Gavroche. 'I want you to take this letter to the rue de l'Homme-armé. Can you do that for me?'

'Yes, but not now!' said Gavroche. 'I'm staying here for the fighting. I can shoot too, you know!'

'Gavroche, you're just a boy! We don't want you to die in the fighting. Stay away from the shooting! And this letter is very important to me. It must go now. I want you to put it into Cosette's hands. Please, Gavroche.'

'I want you to put this letter into Cosette's hands.'

'I want you to put this letter into Cosette's hands.'

'Oh, very well,' said Gavroche. He took the letter, put it inside his shirt, and ran off into the dark.

When Valjean and Cosette left the house in Rue Plumet, Cosette was very sad. Valjean saw this, but he said nothing. In the rue de l'Homme-armé, Cosette stayed in her bedroom. Toussaint took her meals up to her.

In the night Valjean could not sleep. The city was quiet, but for how long? He went outside the house and stood in the street, listening. There were voices in the next street, and then he heard singing. A boy, singing.

Gavroche came up the street, looking at the house numbers. He saw Valjean and stopped.

'Well, young man, what's the news?' said Valjean.

'The news is that I'm hungry,' said Gavroche.

Valjean put his hand in his pocket and found a five-franc piece. Gavroche stared at it. He didn't see many five-franc pieces, and he was very pleased to see this one. He put it in his pocket.

'You're all right,' he said. 'Do you live in this street? Do you know number seven?'

'What do you want with number seven?' said Valjean.

'What do you want with number seven?' said Valjean.

'What do you want with number seven?' said Valjean.

'Letter for someone,' said Gavroche. 'A woman.'

Valjean stared at him. He felt cold. A woman. Cosette? He remembered at once the young man in the Luxembourg. He tried to smile. 'Ah, that's the letter for Cosette,' he said. 'I'm waiting for it.'

'Yes, that's her. Well, here you are,' said Gavroche. 'It comes from the barricade in the rue de la Chanvrerie. I'm going back there now. Goodnight, Monsieur.'

Jean Valjean went back into the house with Marius's letter. He read it quickly... I love you. I can never forget you ... So, Cosette, his dear, dear daughter, was in love. She was his world; without her, his life was nothing. He could not even think about it... When I am dead, don't be sad ... Those words gave him hope. So the young man was one of the rebels at the barricade.

'When the soldiers start shooting,' he thought, 'that's the end of all the rebels. I do nothing, I say nothing, I keep this letter, and poof! Nothing changes in our lives.'

But Valjean did not feel easy. He remembered all their happy years as father and daughter, and he saw again Cosette's sad eyes when they left the Rue Plumet. How could he take her away to England?

He turned and went out of the room. A little later, he left the house, wearing dark clothes and carrying a gun, and walked away down the street.

爱情和起义


引言

那么，马吕斯的主意是什么呢？是这样的：他想和珂赛特结婚，可是他没有钱。他的祖父有钱，他得求他祖父……可是他祖父上了年纪，老人的想法不是那么容易改变的。他冲着马吕斯叫嚷，马吕斯还以颜色，事情就这样不了了之了。第二天傍晚，他像往常一样去了卜吕梅街。花园里没有人，屋子里黑着灯，窗户都关起来了——珂赛特和她的父亲已经走了。

马吕斯没有珂赛特就活不下去。他想到了死，可是伽弗洛什告诉他，他的朋友们需要他。这时是1832年6月，学生和工人在巴黎街头奔走，在城市里发动起义，每个人都必须和政府作斗争。马吕斯很快就来到了街垒，手里拿着一把枪。他感到高兴。士兵枪支射出的子弹，随时会把他带到死神面前。

这是充满危险的时代。冉阿让在卜吕梅街附近的一条街道上看见了沙威督察。他来这里干什么？警察在监视他的房子吗？冉阿让不能再等了。他和珂赛特当天晚上就离开了卜吕梅街。他们搬到了武人街7号，开始收拾东西准备动身前往英格兰。

在这动荡不安的时代，爱情如何能找到出路？

当士兵在军火库前发起进攻时，人们掉头四散奔逃，穿过城市的大街小巷。马吕斯和他的朋友们来到了麻厂街，在这里筑起了街垒。街垒有两米高，是用木头和石块筑成的。义军藏身在街垒后面，等待士兵的进攻。夜幕降临，可是一丁点儿动静也没有。

安灼拉是学生的领袖。他把伽弗洛什叫到跟前。

“你的个子小。”他说，“没人会注意到你。你到城里转一圈，各处看看，然后给我们报个信。”

午夜刚过，伽弗洛什就回来了。“士兵们没有新的动向。”他说，“不过他们人数很多。”他突然停住话头低声道：“嘿，那个人是谁？那边那个高个子男人？”

安灼拉和马吕斯转头望去。

“我不认识他。”马吕斯说。

“整晚上都有人进进出出的。”安灼拉说，“怎么啦，伽弗洛什？你认识他？”

“是，”伽弗洛什压低声音说，“他不是我们的人。他是个密探，警局的密探。他叫沙威。有一次，他在河边把我拦了下来，把我关进牢里关了一整夜。”

“你确定吗，伽弗洛什？”马吕斯问道。

“我非常确定。”伽弗洛什答道，“他是个密探！”

义军不喜欢密探。安灼拉手下有四个人冲着沙威一拥而上，把他拖到了街垒后的酒馆里，绑在了墙上。

“我们现在就枪毙他吗？”其中一个人问道。

“等等再说。”安灼拉说，“先不着急杀他。”

他们走出酒馆，回到了街垒，留神听着士兵们的动静。伽弗洛什在街垒远远的一头找到了马吕斯。

“马吕斯，”他低声说，“我回来的路上经过你的住处，就走了进去。”

“你进去干什么？”马吕斯小声问道。

“我饿了。”伽弗洛什说，“你的房东太太人很好，她总是给我吃的。她有封信让我带给你。她把信给了我。她说，信是两天前收到的。”

“有封信？是谁写来的信？”马吕斯的心里突然闪现出一丝希望。“快——把信给我。”

信是珂赛特写来的。

我最亲爱的，爸爸说我们必须马上离开。我们今晚搬到武人街7号，然后很快就会前往英格兰。哦，亲爱的，没有你我可怎么活啊？——珂赛特

马吕斯把信读了四遍，然后又吻了一下。她还爱着他！他得马上给她回信，向她作最后的道别。街上仍然没有士兵的动静。他找了几张纸和一支铅笔。

我最亲爱的珂赛特，我赶到卜吕梅街时，你已经走了。我们结不成婚了。我去找过我的祖父，他不肯答应。我身无分文，你也是一样。我爱你。我永远也忘不了你。这里的战斗很快就要打响了。我死了以后，你不要难过。我们的爱是美好的。——马吕斯

他把伽弗洛什叫了过来。“我想请你把这封信送到武人街。你能帮我这个忙吗？”

“没问题，可是现在不行！”伽弗洛什说，“我要留在这儿战斗。你要知道，我也会开枪的！”

“伽弗洛什，你还是个孩子！我们可不希望你在战斗中牺牲。一旦开火你一定要躲开！这封信对我非常重要，一定要现在就送。请你务必把这封信交到珂赛特的手里。拜托你了，伽弗洛什。”

“哦，那好吧。”伽弗洛什说。他接过信，塞进衬衫里头，跑进了夜色之中。

冉阿让和珂赛特离开卜吕梅街的住处时，珂赛特非常难过。冉阿让看在眼里，但他什么都没有说。在武人街的住处，珂赛特呆在自己的卧室里。杜桑把一日三餐给她送上楼去。

到了晚上，冉阿让无法合眼。整座城市静悄悄的，可是这安静能持续多久呢？他走出屋子，站在街上倾听。邻街传来几个人说话的声音，接着他听到了歌声。一个男孩在唱歌。

伽弗洛什从街头走来，挨个去看门牌号码。他看到冉阿让后停下了脚步。

“嗨，小伙子，有什么消息吗？”冉阿让问。

“消息就是我肚子饿了。”伽弗洛什说。

冉阿让把手伸进口袋，掏出了一枚五法郎硬币。伽弗洛什两眼直勾勾地看着硬币。他还没见过几回五法郎的硬币呢，看到这枚硬币真有点心花怒放。他把硬币放进了自己的口袋。

“你人不错。”他说，“你住在这条街上吗？你知道7号是哪一家吗？”

“你找7号那家干什么？”冉阿让问。

“送封信给人。”伽弗洛什说，“一个女人。”

冉阿让盯着他，心里凉了半截。一个女人。珂赛特？他一下子记起了卢森堡公园里的那个小伙子。他想要挤出点笑容。“啊，这是给珂赛特的信。”他说，“我正等着这封信呢。”

“对，就是给她的。喏，给你。”伽弗洛什说，“信是从麻厂街的街垒送来的。我现在要回那儿去了。晚安，先生。”

冉阿让拿着马吕斯的信回到了屋子里。他快速地把信读了一遍……我爱你。我永远也忘不了你…… 这么说，他最最亲爱的女儿珂赛特恋爱了。她就是他的整个世界；没有了她，他的生活便失去了意义。他连想都不敢去想……我死了以后，你不要难过 ……信上的这几句话又给了他希望。这么说来，这个小伙子是在街垒战斗的义军一员。

“士兵开火之后，”他想，“这些起义的人都会死掉。我什么都不做，什么都不说，只要把这封信藏起来，噗 ！我们的生活还将和原来一样。”

可冉阿让并没安下心来。他想起了这些年他们父女俩相依为命的快乐时光，之后他眼前又浮现出他们离开卜吕梅街时珂赛特悲伤的眼神。他怎么能把她带到英格兰去呢？

他转身走出房间，不一会儿便出门了。他穿着深色衣服，带了一支枪，沿着街道走去。

The Barricades


FOREWORD

It is a long night at the barricade in the Rue de la Chanvrerie. The news is bad. More and more soldiers are arriving in the city, but the people stay in their homes. This time they don't want to fight the government. Only the students are still at the barricades, waiting for the soldiers' bullets – and death.

Then a new man arrives at the barricade, a big man in dark clothes. Marius stares. It is Cosette's father, he is certain. Is he a friend or an enemy? Who knows?

Inside the tavern, Javert too waits for death. Rebels shoot spies, he knows that. Does he think about his life, waiting there in the tavern? Is the law always right? Can a criminal change and be a good man? Does Javert ask these questions? Who knows?

Daylight comes, and the shooting begins. Ratatat-ratatat-ratatat on the barricade, noise and shouting, cries and screams. Valjean saves Enjolras's life. Two men die. Valjean carries the bodies into the tavern, sees Javert. And Javert sees him. Then the shooting stops.

The rebels need more bullets, and Gavroche runs out to the front of the barricade. Come back, Gavroche! He doesn't listen, and starts singing. There are dead soldiers lying in the street. Gavroche takes the bullets from their bags and puts them into his bag. He is small and quick, and his bag is nearly full before the soldiers start shooting at him. Come back, Gavroche! He sings louder, but the fifth bullet hits him, and he falls down in the street. He moves once, then falls back. Gavroche is dead. A child of the Paris streets, his singing now stopped for ever, just another dead body in the rebellion.

Smoke from the guns is everywhere, it is hard to see anything. But Marius runs out into the street, picks Gavroche up, and runs back. He puts the small body on a table in the tavern, and cries.

It is going to be a long day.

Behind the barricade Enjolras talked to the men. 'They're going to attack again soon – sixty soldiers to every one of us. Marius and I are your two leaders. Gavroche brought us bullets, so let's use them well, and fight to the end.'

'Let's kill the spy now,' said one of the men.

Then Valjean spoke. 'Give him to me. I can do that for you. I'd like to shoot him.'

Enjolras looked at him. 'You saved my life, friend. You can have the spy.'

Valjean took Javert out of the tavern to a little street behind. He took out a knife.

'Oh, a knife!' said Javert. 'Of course, a criminal's way to kill. So, kill me, and be quick.'

Valjean said nothing. He cut the ropes around Javert's arms and legs, then stood up, and said:

'You're free to go.'

'You're free to go,' said Valjean.

'You're free to go,' said Valjean.

Javert stared. He could not understand this.

'I live in the rue de l'Homme-armé,' Valjean said. 'The next time we meet, you can arrest me. Now, go!'

Javert turned and walked away. Valjean fired his gun into the air, then went back to the barricade. 'It's done,' he told Enjolras.

Now the second attack began. The government had more men, more guns, more bullets – and one by one, the students began to die. Marius was on top of the barricade. He was one of the last men still alive, but then one, two bullets hit him, and he fell. Two great hands at once picked him up. 'Cosette,' whispered Marius, and then he went into that dark night.

Jean Valjean knew Paris well, knew its little back streets, its secret places. He used them now. With the dead or dying Marius in his arms, he ran through the back streets, watching at every corner. Night came, and the sky was full of the smoke from the guns. Valjean stopped to rest. In Marius's pocket he found a piece of paper.

Take my body to my grandfather's house in...

The address was in the marais, not far away. Valjean began to pick up Marius's body again – and a hand came down hard on his shoulder. Valjean turned.

A hand came down hard on Valjean's shoulder.

A hand came down hard on Valjean's shoulder.

Javert stood behind him. 'What are you doing here?' he said. 'Who is this man?'

Valjean stood up. 'Inspector Javert,' he said, 'I told you, I'm tired of running and hiding. You can arrest me, put me back in prison. I ask just one thing. Help me to take this young man home. That is all.'

'He's dead,' said Javert.

'No. Not yet. He lives in the marais with his grandfather. Look.' He showed Javert the piece of paper.

Javert read the address, then called to a carriage along the street. They put Marius's body on the back seat, and sat side by side on the front seat.

At the house of Marius's grandfather, a servant opened the door. She gave a little scream when she saw Marius in Valjean's arms. 'It's Monsieur Marius!'

'Take the boy in,' said Javert. 'I'm waiting for you here at the door.' His voice was different, uncertain.

Valjean looked at him, then carried Marius's body into the house. 'Call a doctor quickly,' he said to the servants. 'He was at the barricade and has two bullets still in him.' Then he came back downstairs and out into the street.

Javert was gone. Valjean looked up and down the street. Nothing. Nobody.

Down by the river seine, near the Place du Châtelet, Javert stood on the bridge, looking down into the water.

'What must I do?' he thought, but for the first time in his life he had no answer. Valjean's words at the barricade went through his head again and again. You're free to go... free to go... free to go.

'I can do one of two things,' Javert said to the river. 'I can arrest him, or I can not arrest him and say "You are free to go." But the law is the law – so I must arrest him. But he gave me my life – so I must give him his life. But the law is the law...'

And a voice in Javert's head said, You worked for the law all your life, but Jean Valjean is a better man than you are.

For a long time Javert stared down at the river, but the river gave him no answer to his question. Then he took off his hat, and put it carefully on the ground. A moment later, he stood high on the bridge, then fell, down into the dark river.

There was a splash, and that was all.

街垒


引言

对在麻厂街街垒的人们来说，这是一个漫漫长夜。他们听到的都是坏消息。越来越多的士兵进到城里，普通市民则呆在家里闭门不出——这一回他们不愿意和政府对抗。只有学生仍然留守在街垒，等待士兵的子弹——还有死亡。

这时候，一个新面孔来到了街垒，是个穿着深色衣服的大个子男人。马吕斯盯着他。他就是珂赛特的父亲，这一点他可以肯定。他到底是朋友还是敌人？只有老天知道。

在酒馆里，沙威也在等待死亡。义军对待密探都是一律枪毙，他是知道的。在酒馆里等待的时候，他是在回想自己的一生吗？法律总是正确的吗？一个罪犯能够改变，变成一个好人吗？沙威想到过这些问题吗？只有老天知道。

天亮了，枪声大作。嗒嗒嗒——嗒嗒嗒——嗒嗒嗒的枪声在街垒响起，伴随枪声的是喧哗和叫嚷，哭喊和尖叫。冉阿让救了安灼拉的命。有两名起义者死了。冉阿让把他们的尸体拖进酒馆时看到了沙威。沙威也看到了他。这时候，枪声停止了。

义军需要更多的子弹，伽弗洛什冲到了街垒前面。回来，伽弗洛什！ 他不理睬，反而开始唱起歌来。死去士兵的尸体躺在街道上。伽弗洛什从他们的包里拿出子弹，放进自己的包里。他个子小，动作快，还没等到士兵开始向他射击，他的包就已经差不多满了。回来，伽弗洛什！ 他的歌声更加嘹亮，可是第五颗子弹击中了他，他倒在了街道上。他动了一下，又倒了下去。伽弗洛什死了。一个在巴黎街头流浪的孩子，现在成了义军中的又一具尸体，他再也不会歌唱了。

回来，伽弗洛什！

回来，伽弗洛什！

到处都是枪管喷出的硝烟，什么都看不清楚。可是马吕斯跑到了街道上，抱起伽弗洛什，跑了回来。他把他瘦小的尸身放在酒馆的一张桌子上，哭了起来。

这将会是漫长的一天。

在街垒后面，安灼拉对着义军喊话：“他们很快就会再次进攻——我们一个人要对付六十个士兵。马吕斯和我是你们的指挥。伽弗洛什为我们找来了子弹，我们一定要好好利用这些子弹，战斗到最后一刻。”

“我们现在就处决了那个密探吧。”一个起义者说。

这时冉阿让开了口：“把他交给我吧。我可以为你们办这件事。我想亲手打死他。”

安灼拉看了看他：“你救了我的命，朋友。这个密探就交给你了。”

冉阿让带着沙威出了酒馆，来到酒馆后面的一条小巷。他掏出一把刀。

“哦，一把刀！”沙威说，“当然啦，这就是罪犯杀人的方式。来，杀了我吧，快点！”

冉阿让什么都没有说。他割断了绑着沙威胳膊和腿的绳子，然后站起身来，说道：

“你可以走了。”

沙威久久地望着他。他不明白这是怎么回事。

“我住在武人街。”冉阿让说，“我们下回再碰面的时候，你可以逮捕我。好了，走吧！”

沙威转身走了。冉阿让朝天开了一枪，然后回到了街垒。“我已经把他处决了。”他告诉安灼拉。

这时，第二轮进攻开始了。政府有更多的人，更多的枪，更多的子弹——学生们开始一个接着一个地死去。马吕斯站在街垒上，他是最后几个幸存者之一。但就在这时，一颗子弹击中了他，接着又是一颗。他倒下了。两只大手立刻把他抱了起来。“珂赛特。”马吕斯呢喃了一句，接着眼前一黑，昏了过去。

冉阿让对巴黎了如指掌，知道它的后街小巷，它的隐秘之地。这时，这些都派上了用场。他把马吕斯抱在怀里，也不知道他是死是活，只顾着穿街走巷，过每一个拐角都小心翼翼。夜幕降临，天空中弥漫着硝烟。冉阿让停下来喘口气。他在马吕斯的口袋里找到了一张纸。

把我的尸体带到我祖父家，他住在……

地址在玛莱区，离这儿不远。冉阿让再次把马吕斯抱了起来——这时，一只手用力按住了他的肩头。冉阿让回过头来。

站在他身后的是沙威。“你在这里干什么？”他说，“这个人是谁？”

冉阿让站起身来。“沙威督察，”他说，“我告诉过你，我已经厌倦了逃跑和躲藏。你可以逮捕我，把我送回监狱。我只有一个请求。帮我把这个年轻人送回家。就这一件事。”

“他死了。”沙威说。

“不，他还没死。他和祖父住在玛莱区。瞧。”他把那张纸给沙威看。

沙威看过地址后，叫住了街上一辆马车。他们把马吕斯放在后座上，然后并排坐在马车的前座上。

到了马吕斯祖父的家，一个仆人来开开门。她看到冉阿让怀里的马吕斯时，轻轻地惊呼了一声:“是马吕斯先生！”

“把这个孩子弄进屋去。”沙威说，“我在门口等你。”他的声音带着迟疑，与以往不同。

冉阿让看了他一眼，就抱着马吕斯进屋去了。“赶快去请一位大夫。”他对仆人们说，“他在街垒战斗，身上中了两颗子弹。”然后他下了楼，回到了街上。

沙威已经不在了。冉阿让往街上张望，什么都没瞧见。一个人都没有。

沙威在塞纳河近沙特雷广场的一段。他站在桥上，低头望着水面。

“我到底该怎么做呢？”他在心里问自己，但这一次，也是人生中第一次，他想不出答案。他脑海里一遍又一遍地回想起冉阿让在街垒说的话。你可以走了……可以走了……可以走了。

“我有两个选择。”沙威对着河水说，“我可以逮捕他，我也可以不 逮捕他，并对他说‘你可以走了。’可法律终归是法律——所以我必须逮捕他。但他救过我的命——所以我也必须救他 一命。可法律终归是法律……”

一个声音在沙威的头脑中说道：“你一辈子都在为法律服务，可冉阿让是一个比你更加正直的人。”

沙威久久地盯着河水，可是河水没有告诉他答案。后来，他摘下帽子，小心翼翼地把它放在地上。不一会儿，他高高地站到了桥栏杆上，接着跳了下去，落入漆黑的河水中。

桥下传来扑通一声，随后就什么动静也没有了。

Love and Death


FOREWORD

Marius lies for a long time between life and death, but months later, he is well again. Cosette visits him every day, and this of course helps him a lot. His grandfather is happy to have his grandson back, and is happy to have a new granddaughter in Cosette. The two young people marry, and live in the house of Marius's grandfather in the Marais.

There is a surprise for the young people. Cosette has money, a lot of money, Valjean tells them. She has six hundred thousand francs. This pleases Marius's grandfather very much, but the young people are only interested in love, not in money.

Where does it come from, this money? Years ago, when Valjean was Monsieur Madeleine with a factory, he was a rich man. Before he left Montreuil, he took his money and the bishop's candlesticks to a secret place. When he needs money, he goes back there.

Now this money is for Cosette, and the candlesticks stand in Valjean's house in the Rue de l'Homme-Armé. They look very fine, and Toussaint cleans them every day.

A new life begins for everybody, but there are still secrets from the past, and Valjean wants to tell them. He feels old and tired. Death is coming for him at last, he feels. He calls Cosette and Marius to his bedside.

'Listen, dearest Cosette, to the story of your mother,' he says. Cosette hears the story of Fantine's sad life. She learns that Valjean is not her real father, but in her life there is only one father, and that is Valjean, she tells him.

'Come closer, my children,' he says. 'I love you dearly, and I die happy. Come closer, and take my hands.'

Cosette and Marius are by his bed, holding his hands and crying. His great hands are still, and do not move again. He lies with his head turned up to the sky, and the light from the bishop's candlesticks falls upon his face.

爱与死


引言

马吕斯在生死线上挣扎了很长一段时间，不过几个月后，他终于康复了。珂赛特每天都来探望他，这当然对他的复原起了很大作用。看到孙子又回来了，马吕斯的祖父十分开心，而看到自己新添了珂赛特这样一位孙媳妇，老人更是高兴。两个年轻人结了婚，住在玛莱区马吕斯祖父的房子里。

这两个年轻人得知了一个意外的消息。冉阿让告诉他们，珂赛特有钱了，很大一笔钱。她拥有60万法郎。这让马吕斯的祖父十分高兴，不过这两个年轻人心里想的只有爱，并不在乎钱。

这笔钱是从哪儿来的呢？许多年前，在冉阿让还是开工厂的马德兰先生时，他是一个富有的人。离开蒙特勒伊之前，他把这笔钱和主教的烛台藏到了一个秘密的地方。他需要钱的时候，就到那里去取。

现在这笔钱是珂赛特的了，烛台则摆在武人街冉阿让的家里。它们看上去十分漂亮，杜桑每天都要把它们擦拭一番。

每个人都开始了新的生活，不过还有些过去的秘密，冉阿让想要告诉他们。他觉得自己老了，累了。他觉得死神终于要找上门来了。他把珂赛特和马吕斯叫到了自己的床边。

“听好了，最亲爱的珂赛特，这是你妈妈的故事。”他说。珂赛特听到了芳汀一生悲惨的遭遇。她知道了冉阿让不是他的亲生父亲，可她对冉阿让说，她这辈子只有一个父亲，那就是冉阿让。

“靠近点，我的孩子们。”他说，“我非常爱你们，我现在可以高兴地闭眼了。靠近点，抓住我的手。”

珂赛特和马吕斯偎依在他的床边，抓住他的手哭了起来。他的一双大手僵住了，再也不动了。他仰面躺在那里，主教的烛台上燃着的烛光照在他的脸上。

LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY

Cedric Errol lives with his American mother in New York. His father came from England, but he died some years ago, and Cedric knows nothing about his father's family. But one day an English lawyer comes to New York. He is Mr Havisham, lawyer to the Earl of Dorincourt, and he has news for Cedric and his mother. The Earl is Cedric's grandfather, and because Cedric's father is dead, Cedric is now the heir to the Dorincourt riches and family name. He must leave New York, say goodbye to his friends Mr Hobbs the grocery-man and Dick the boot-black, and go to England. As the Earl's grandson, his name is now Lord Fauntleroy, and he must live in a castle with his rich old grandfather.

But rich people are not always happy people, or nice people. The Earl of Dorincourt is an angry, selfish, bad-tempered old man, and he hates America and Americans. Everyone is afraid of him. But to Cedric, a grandfather is someone to love, and the Earl has a lot to learn from his American grandson...

A big surprise

Cedric Errol and his mamma were very good friends. This was important because there were only two of them. Cedric's father was dead, and it was a sad day in the little house in New York when Mrs Errol told Cedric this news.

'Dear, dear Ceddie,' she said. 'Your papa was very ill last week and – and he – he's not coming home to us. He's never coming home again because...' And then she began to cry.

Cedric was only seven years old, but he was a very loving little boy. He went at once to his mamma and put his little arms around her and his face next to her face. They did not need any more words.

So Cedric and his mother were alone in the world. Mrs Errol's mother and father were dead, and Mr Errol's family was in England. Mr Errol's father – Cedric's grandfather – was an important man. He was the Earl of Dorincourt, the head of one of the oldest and most famous families in England. He lived at Dorincourt Castle, and was very rich.

But he was not a nice person. He was an angry, bad-tempered old man – and he hated America and Americans. So when his youngest son, Cedric's father, married an American girl in New York, a girl without money or family, just a nobody, the Earl was very angry. He wrote this letter to his son:

Never come to Dorincourt Castle, and never write to me. I don't want to see you again. Don't ask me for help or money. You can live – or die; I don't want to know. You are no longer my son.

Never come to Dorincourt Castle, and never write to me. I don't want to see you again. Don't ask me for help or money. You can live – or die; I don't want to know. You are no longer my son.

The Earl had two older sons, but they were bad, selfish men. They spent the Earl's money on horses and women, never said a kind word, or did a good thing in their lives. Nobody liked them, and their father hated them. They were a black page in the book of the Dorincourt family.

Cedric's father was very different from his brothers. He had a beautiful face, was tall and strong, and had the kindest heart in the world. Everybody loved him.

He was very sad when his father's angry letter arrived. He loved his home in England, and he even loved his bad-tempered old father. But he was young and happy with his sweet young wife.

Soon Cedric arrived, and there never was a happier child than little Ceddie. He slept well, he ate well, he smiled a lot, and never cried. And he had big brown eyes and beautiful golden-yellow hair.

When he was older, he still smiled a lot, and he was the happiest, friendliest little boy in the world. Everybody liked him. Everybody liked to talk to him when they met him in the street. He had some good friends. There was Mr Hobbs, the grocery-man in the store at the end of their street. There were the children along the street, and there was Dick, the boot-black boy. And there was Bridget. Bridget had twelve children, and her husband was a builder. But he was often ill and could not work, and then there was no money for the rent. Cedric felt very sorry for them all when life was difficult.

The Earl of Dorincourt was an angry, bad-tempered old man.

Cedric's best friend was his mamma. Her eyes were sad, and she always wore a black dress, but she was young and pretty, and she loved her little boy very much.

So life went on for Cedric Errol and his friends. Then one day everything changed. Mrs Errol had a visitor from England. He was a tall old man, in dark clothes. His name was Mr Havisham, and he was the lawyer for the Earl of Dorincourt. He had some very surprising news for Cedric's mother.

'You know that the Earl had three sons, Mrs Errol,' he said. 'The two older sons, Bevis and Maurice, died two or three months ago – one in an accident, and the other from an illness. They were not married and they had no children. Your husband is dead too, and so his son is now the heir. Cedric Errol is now Lord Fauntleroy and the next Earl of Dorincourt after his grandfather dies.'

Mrs Errol's face went very white. 'Oh,' she said, 'is the Earl going to take Cedric away from me? We are so happy together. I try to be a good mother to him.'

Mr Havisham was not a family man. He was a lawyer, a cold man of business, but he saw that Mrs Errol was a loving mother. His next news was difficult to say.

'I must tell you, Mrs Errol,' he said, 'that the Earl is not very friendly to you. He does not like America or Americans, and he was very angry when his son married you. I am sorry to say this, but he does not want to see you. He wants Lord Fauntleroy to live with him at Dorincourt Castle, but he wants you to live in a different house. He is giving you a house called Court Lodge, and there Lord Fauntleroy can visit you every day.'

Mr Havisham watched Mrs Errol carefully. 'Is she going to cry?' he thought. He did not know the right words to say to a crying woman.

But Mrs Errol did not cry. She stood for a moment at the window, then turned and looked at the lawyer.

'My husband loved Dorincourt,' she said quietly. 'He loved England, and everything English. He was very sad to leave it all. So I think Ceddie must go back, and learn how to be an English earl.'

She looked at the lawyer with her sweet, sad eyes. 'I hope the Earl can learn to love Ceddie. He is only little, and he is a very loving child.'

Mr Havisham thought about the old Earl. He was a bad-tempered, selfish old man, and did not love anyone. But the lawyer did not say this.

Cedric's best friend was his mamma.

'Mrs Errol,' he said, 'the Earl wants the best of everything for his grandson. He wants him to be happy. Your son is going to have a very good life at Dorincourt.'

A short time later Cedric came home from a visit to his friend Mr Hobbs, the grocery-man. He was very surprised to find a visitor in the sitting room. His mother ran to him and took his hands.

'Oh Ceddie,' she cried. 'Dear, dear Ceddie!'

Mr Havisham stood up and looked down at Cedric. 'And so this,' he said slowly, 'is little Lord Fauntleroy.'

大吃一惊

锡德里克·埃罗尔和他的妈妈是非常好的朋友。这很重要，因为只有他们俩相依为命。锡德里克的父亲过世了。那是个令人哀伤的日子，在纽约的小屋里，埃罗尔太太告诉了锡德里克这个消息。

“我最亲爱的锡迪，”她说，“你爸爸上周病得非常厉害，他——他不会回家，回到我们身边了。他永远都不会再回家了，因为……”然后她哭了起来。

锡德里克只有七岁，但他是个非常有爱心的小男孩。他立刻走到妈妈身边，用自己小小的胳膊拥抱她，把脸贴到妈妈脸上。他们不需要再多说什么了。

就这样，锡德里克和妈妈在这世上无依无靠了。埃罗尔太太的父母已经去世，而埃罗尔先生家又在英格兰。埃罗尔先生的父亲——锡德里克的祖父——是个很有身份的人物。他是多林考特伯爵，多林考特是英格兰历史最悠久最负盛名的家族之一，而他就是这个家族的首领。他住在多林考特城堡里，非常富有。

但他并不是个和善的人。他是个易怒、坏脾气的老头儿——他讨厌美国和美国人。所以，当他的小儿子，也就是锡德里克的父亲，在纽约娶了一个没钱没家世、默默无闻的美国女孩时，伯爵非常生气。他写了这样一封信给他儿子：

永远别回多林考特城堡，永远别给我写信。我再也不想见到你。别要我帮忙，也别朝我要钱。你是生是死我都不想知道。你再也不是我儿子。

伯爵还有两个年纪稍长的儿子，但他们是又坏又自私的人。他们花伯爵的钱赌马、玩女人，一生中没说过一句好话，没做过一件好事。没人喜欢他们，连他们的父亲也厌恶他们。他们就是多林考特家族的污点。

锡德里克的父亲和他的哥哥们不一样。他相貌英俊，个子高大，身体健壮，还有一颗世上最善良的心。人人都爱他。

看到父亲怒气冲冲的来信，他非常难过。他爱他在英格兰的家，甚至爱他坏脾气的老父亲。但是他还年轻，对自己年轻可爱的妻子很是满意。

没多久，锡德里克降生了，世上再没有比小锡迪更快乐的孩子了。他睡得香，吃得香，经常笑，从来不哭。他有一双大大的棕色眼睛和美丽的金黄色头发。

他长大一些后，还是经常笑。他是这世上最开心、最友善的小男孩。人人都喜欢他。每个人在路上碰见他，都乐意跟他说话。他交了一些好朋友，有街道尽头那家食品杂货店的老板霍布斯先生，有街上的孩子们，有擦皮鞋的男孩迪克，还有布里奇特。布里奇特有十二个孩子。她丈夫是个建筑工人，可他常常生病，没法工作，所以就没钱付房租。他们每个人生活艰难时，锡德里克都感到十分难过。

锡德里克最好的朋友是他妈妈。她的眼里充满忧伤，永远穿着黑裙子。但是她年轻漂亮，并且深爱着她的孩子。

锡德里克·埃罗尔和朋友们的日子就这样一天天过去了。突然有一天，一切都改变了。有位从英格兰来的客人来拜访埃罗尔太太，他是个高个子老头儿，穿着深色的衣服。他是多林考特伯爵的律师哈维沙姆先生。他给锡德里克的母亲带来了非常令人吃惊的消息。

您知道伯爵有三个儿子，埃罗尔太太。”他说，“两个年纪稍长的，贝维斯和莫里斯，两三个月前都去世了——一个是出车祸，一个是生病。他们都没结婚，也没有孩子。您丈夫也去世了，所以他的儿子现在是继承人。锡德里克·埃罗尔现在是方特勒罗伊爵爷了，他祖父过世后，他就是下一任多林考特伯爵。”

埃罗尔太太脸色惨白。“噢，”她说，“伯爵要把锡德里克从我身边带走吗？我们在一起很快乐。我在努力当一个好妈妈。”

哈维沙姆先生对家庭没有概念。他是律师，一个办事冷冰冰的人，但他看得出埃罗尔太太是位慈爱的母亲。他很难开口说接下来的消息。

“我必须告诉您，埃罗尔太太，”他说，“伯爵对您不是很有好感。他不喜欢美国，也不喜欢美国人，而且他儿子娶您时他很生气。我很抱歉说出这话，但他不想见您。他要方特勒罗伊爵爷和他一起住在多林考特城堡，而要您住在别的地方。他会把一栋叫洛奇公寓的房子给您，方特勒罗伊爵爷可以每天去那儿看您。”

哈维沙姆先生小心翼翼地看着埃罗尔太太。“她会哭吗？”他想。他不知道对一个哭泣的女人说什么才好。

但埃罗尔太太没有哭。她在窗边站了一会儿，然后转身看着律师。

“我丈夫很爱多林考特。”她平静地说，“他爱英格兰，爱英国的一切。离开那一切他很难过。所以，我认为锡迪必须回去，去学习如何做一位英国伯爵。”

她用那双温柔、忧伤的眼睛望着律师。“我希望伯爵能学着去爱锡迪。他还小，而且是个很有爱心的孩子。”

哈维沙姆先生想了想老伯爵。他是个坏脾气、自私的老头儿，没爱过任何人。但是律师没说出口。

“埃罗尔太太，”他说，“伯爵希望他孙子得到的一切都是最好的。他希望他能快乐。您的儿子在多林考特会过得很好。”

过了一会儿，锡德里克从他的朋友，食品杂货店老板霍布斯先生那儿回到家。看到客厅里有客人，他很惊讶。母亲跑过去，握住他的手。

“哦，锡迪，”她哭着说，“我最亲爱的锡迪！”

哈维沙姆先生站起身，低头看着锡德里克。“那么这位，”他慢慢地说，“就是方特勒罗伊小爵爷了。”

Saying goodbye to America

It was a lot of news for a seven-year-old boy – uncles dying, an English grandfather, a new home in England, a new name... He did not understand it all at first. And when he did, he was not very happy.

'Oh, dearest,' he said to his mother. (Cedric's father always called her 'dearest', and so the little boy used the name too.) 'I don't think I want to be an Earl. None of the boys in our street are Earls. Please can I not be one?'

'Your papa loved his home in England, Ceddie,' said his mother. 'I think he would like you to go there, and be an Earl one day.'

'I'm sorry to leave all my friends. Dick, and Bridget, and everyone,' said Cedric sadly. 'And Mr Hobbs isn't going to like the news. He says kings and lords are all bad people. America has a president, and Mr Hobbs says presidents are much better than kings.'

The next day Cedric went to see Mr Hobbs at his grocery store. He sat down in his usual place, but at first he could not find the words to tell Mr Hobbs his news. Then he said it all at once, very quickly.

Mr Hobbs stared at him. 'Well!' he said. 'Can this be true?'

'Yes, Mr Hobbs,' said Cedric. 'I'm sorry to say it's all true. Mr Havisham says I am Lord Fauntleroy now, and one day I'm going to be the Earl of Dorincourt, after my grandfather dies.'

'Well!' said Mr Hobbs. 'Well, well, well!'

They talked about it for a long time, and in the end Mr Hobbs was happier about lords and earls. He liked his young friend very much. He first knew Cedric when he was six weeks old, and he had a grandfatherly interest in the boy. But he did not like Cedric going to England.

'Can't you stay here and be an earl?' he asked.

'No, I can't,' said Cedric sadly. 'Dearest says we must go to England.'

The Dorincourt name was an old and famous one, and the family was very rich, with great houses and castles in England. Mr Havisham, the family's lawyer for forty years, knew the Earl very well. He remembered the Earl's words to him before he left England.

I hate that American woman. She married my son because he was an earl's son, and she wanted to be rich. Her son is going to be just like her.

But after a week in New York Mr Havisham knew differently. 'Mrs Errol married the Earl's son because she loved him with all her heart,' he thought. 'She's not interested in money, she asks nothing for herself. She only wants her little boy to be happy. I think the Earl is wrong about her, and about her little boy.'

'Well!' said Mr Hobbs. 'Well, well, well!'

Mr Havisham was surprised and pleased by the new Lord Fauntleroy. Cedric was a fine boy, tall and strong, with his mother's brown eyes and his father's golden hair. He spoke well, was not afraid of anything, and was friendly with everyone. He had a kind heart, too. Mr Havisham learnt that very soon.

One day he was with Cedric when his mother was out. Mr Havisham wanted to talk to him about his new life in England. But Cedric spoke first.

'Please, what is an earl?' he asked. 'I don't know anything about them. Please can you tell me?'

'An earl is – is a very important person,' Mr Havisham said. 'He usually comes from a very old family. The first Earl of Dorincourt lived four hundred years ago.'

'Well, well!' said Cedric. 'That was a long time ago. That's interesting. But what does an earl do?'

This was not an easy question to answer. 'An earl,' Mr Havisham began, 'um... an earl often helps the king. Perhaps he's a soldier for the king. Some earls were very brave men in the old days.'

'Oh,' said Cedric. 'My papa was a soldier, and he was a very brave man, you know. I'm pleased Earls are brave. It's a good thing to be brave, don't you think?'

'Yes,' Mr Havisham said. 'There is another good thing about Earls. Some of them have money – a lot of money.'

'That's a good thing to have,' said Cedric. 'I'd like a lot of money.'

'Would you?' said Mr Havisham. 'Why?'

'Well,' Cedric said, happily, 'a person can do so many things with money, you see. I can buy beautiful things for Dearest, like books and pretty dresses. I can buy a warm winter coat for Bridget – she lives in our street and has twelve children. And a present for Mr Hobbs at the grocery store. And then for Dick—'

'Who is Dick?' asked Mr Havisham.

'Dick is a boot-black,' said Lord Fauntleroy. 'He cleans people's boots in the street, you know. He's one of the nicest people in the world. When I was little, he was very kind to me once. And when someone is kind to you, you never forget it, do you?'

'And what would you like to do for Dick?' asked the lawyer. He smiled a little smile. A boot-black, a grocery-man, a poor woman with twelve children – strange friends for the grandson of an earl.

'Buy the business for him,' said the young lord happily. 'He works for Jake now, and Jake is no good, you see. Dick does all the work and Jake takes all the money. Dick gets so angry! Dick needs new brushes, and new clothes, and a sign, and then he can get somewhere!'

At that moment Mrs Errol came home. 'I am so sorry to be late,' she said. 'I was at the house of a friend. Her husband is ill, and she needs help, poor thing.'

'Oh,' cried the young lord. He jumped up from his chair. 'That's Bridget. I must visit her too.'

'Dick is a boot-black. He cleans people's boots in the street.'

'One moment,' said the lawyer. He remembered the Earl's words. The boy can have anything. Tell him that. Put money in his pockets, and tell him it came from his grandfather. Mr Havisham told Mrs Errol and Cedric about the Earl's money, but he said it more kindly.

Then he asked, 'So, would Lord Fauntleroy like to help this poor woman?'

At first Cedric did not understand.

His mother put her arms around him. 'Ceddie dear,' she said, 'the Earl is your grandpapa, your papa's father. He's very kind, and he loves you and he wants you to love him. He wants you to be happy and to make other people happy. He's very rich, and he gave Mr Havisham some money for you. You can give some to Bridget now, to pay her rent and to buy food for her husband and her children. Isn't that fine, Ceddie? Isn't he good?'

Cedric's face was suddenly very excited. He looked from his mother to Mr Havisham.

'Can I have it now?' he cried. 'Can I run to her house and give it to her this minute?'

Mr Havisham gave Cedric twenty-five dollars, and Cedric was out of the house in seconds.

A short time later Cedric was back, with a big smile on his face. 'Bridget cried,' he said. 'She cried because she was so happy. I think I'm going to like being an earl.'

The old lawyer smiled his little smile again. 'What's the Earl going to think about that?' he thought. 'He gives his grandson money, and the boy gives it to a poor woman to pay her rent.'

'You can give some money to Bridget now,' said his mother.

The day for leaving New York came quickly. In the last days Lord Fauntleroy was very busy. With the Earl's money, Bridget's children all had new clothes, and Mr Hobbs had a very fine gold watch from his little friend.

'Look,' said Cedric. 'The watch has our names on the back. So you can't forget me!'

Mr Hobbs held the watch in his hand, and at first he could not speak. 'I'm not going to forget you, my boy,' he said at last. 'You never forget a good friend, do you?'

Dick, too, could not find words at first to thank his little friend. He now had new brushes, a big new sign, and the best boot-black business in New York. On the last day he came to the house to say goodbye.

'I'm sorry he's going away, I really am,' he said to Mr Havisham. 'I never had a friend like him.' Dick shook Cedric's hand for a long time. 'Goodbye,' he said. 'Write and tell me all about it, earls and everything.'

That evening Cedric's mamma was very quiet.

Cedric held her hand. 'It's sad saying goodbye to all our friends and our little house, isn't it, Dearest?' he said.

'Yes, Ceddie dear, it is,' she said. 'Very, very sad.'

告别美国

对于一个七岁的小男孩来说，这一连串消息太多了——伯父的辞世、英国的祖父、英格兰的新家、全新的名字……起初，他完全不明白是怎么回事。而当他明白以后，他不是很开心。

“哦，最最亲爱的，”他对母亲说（锡德里克的父亲总是称呼她为“最最亲爱的”，所以小男孩也这么叫），“我不想当一个伯爵。咱们这条街上没有一个男孩是伯爵。求求您，我能不 当吗？”

“你爸爸很爱他在英格兰的家，锡迪。”他的母亲说，“我想他会希望你去的，也希望你有一天能成为伯爵。”

“离开朋友们我会很难过。迪克、布里奇特，还有大家伙儿。”锡德里克伤心地说，“而且霍布斯先生也不会喜欢这个消息的。他说国王和伯爵都是坏人。美国有总统，霍布斯先生说总统比国王好多了。”

第二天，锡德里克去食品杂货店找霍布斯先生。他在老地方坐下，一开始不知道怎么告诉霍布斯先生这个消息。过了一会儿，他飞快地一股脑儿全说了出来。

霍布斯先生盯着他。“噢！”他说，“这是真的？”

“是的，霍布斯先生。”锡德里克说，“很抱歉，这都是真的。哈维沙姆先生说，我现在是方特勒罗伊爵爷了，哪天爷爷过世后，我还会成为多林考特伯爵。”

“哎哟！”霍布斯先生说，“哎哟，哎哟，哎哟！”

他们就此聊了很长时间，最后，霍布斯先生对爵爷、伯爵什么的感觉好多了。他非常喜欢这位年轻的朋友。他第一次见到锡迪的时候，锡迪才六周大，他对这孩子有着祖父一般的关心。可他不想让锡德里克去英格兰。

“你不能呆在这儿当伯爵吗？”他问道。

“不，不行，”锡德里克伤心地说，“最最亲爱的说我们必须去英格兰。”

多林考特是个古老而显赫的姓氏，这个家族非常富有，在英格兰拥有高大的房屋和城堡。哈维沙姆先生担任家族律师已经四十年了，对伯爵十分了解。他还记得离开英格兰前伯爵对他说的话。

我恨那个美国女人。她嫁给我儿子就是因为他是伯爵的儿子，她想变得富有。她儿子肯定也会跟她一样。

但是，在纽约呆了一周后，哈维沙姆先生有了不同的看法。“埃罗尔太太嫁给伯爵的儿子是因为她全心全意地爱着他，”他想，“她对钱没有兴趣，也没为自己要求过什么。她只希望自己的孩子能幸福。我觉得伯爵错怪了她和她的孩子。”

新的方特勒罗伊爵爷让哈维沙姆先生既惊讶又满意。锡德里克是个漂亮的男孩，长得又高又结实，有着和母亲一样的棕色眼睛，还有和父亲一样的金色头发。他说话得体，不惧怕任何事，对每个人都很友好。他还有颗善良的心。哈维沙姆先生很快就发现了这一点。

一天，他和锡德里克在一起，锡德里克的妈妈出去了。哈维沙姆先生想和他聊聊英格兰的新生活，可锡德里克先开了口。

“请问，伯爵是什么？”他问道，“我一点儿都不知道。请您告诉我好吗？”

“伯爵就是——是非常有地位的人，”哈维沙姆先生说，“他们通常来自非常古老的家族。多林考特家族的第一位伯爵生活在四百年前。”

“哎呀，哎呀！”锡德里克说，“那是很久以前了，真有意思。那么伯爵都做些什么呢？”

这个问题不好回答。“伯爵，”哈维沙姆先生开口说，“嗯……伯爵经常协助国王，算是国王的士兵吧。在过去，有些伯爵是非常英勇的人。”

“噢，”锡德里克说，“我爸爸原来也是士兵，而且非常勇敢，您知道的。我很高兴伯爵是勇敢的人。勇敢是件好事，您不觉得吗？”

“是的，”哈维沙姆先生说，“当伯爵还有一个好处。他们中的一些人有钱——很多的钱。”

“钱很好啊，”锡德里克说，“我想有好多的钱。”

“是吗？”哈维沙姆先生问道，“为什么？”

“嗯，”锡德里克开心地说，“您知道，一个人有钱可以做好多事。我可以给我最最亲爱的买些漂亮的东西，像书啊，好看的衣服啊。我可以给布里奇特买件暖和的冬衣——她住在我们这条街上，有十二个孩子。我还可以给食品杂货店的霍布斯先生买份礼物，还有给迪克——”

“迪克是谁？”哈维沙姆先生问道。

“迪克是擦皮鞋的，”方特勒罗伊小爵爷说，“您知道的，就是在街上给人擦鞋。他是这世上最好的人之一。我小的时候，他对我非常好。别人对您好，您永远不会忘记的，对吧？”

“那么你想为迪克做点什么呢？”律师问道。他露出一丝微笑。一个擦鞋匠，一个食品杂货店老板，一个带着十二个孩子的穷女人——这些就是伯爵孙子奇奇怪怪的朋友们。

“给他买个自己的鞋摊，”小爵爷开心地说，“他现在替杰克干活，您知道吗，杰克不是什么好人。活儿都是迪克在干，钱却都被杰克拿走了。迪克可生气了！迪克需要新刷子、新衣服和一块招牌，然后他一定会干得很好的！”

这时，埃罗尔太太回家了。“真抱歉我回来晚了，”她说，“我在一个朋友家，她丈夫病了，她需要帮助，可怜的人呐。”

“噢！”小爵爷大喊一声，他从椅子上跳起来。“是布里奇特。我也得去看她。”

“等一等，”律师说，他想起伯爵的话。告诉那孩子，他想要什么都可以。给他口袋里塞点钱，告诉他是他爷爷给的。 哈维沙姆先生跟埃罗尔太太和锡德里克提起了伯爵的钱，不过是用更友善的口气说的。

然后他问：“那么，方特勒罗伊爵爷想要帮助这位可怜的女士吗？”

一开始锡德里克没明白他的意思。

他的母亲伸出双手搂过他。“亲爱的锡迪，”她说，“伯爵是你爷爷，你爸爸的父亲。他很善良。他爱你，也希望你爱他。他希望你快乐，也让别人快乐。他很富有，他给了哈维沙姆先生一些钱，是要给你的。你现在可以拿些给布里奇特去付房租，再给她丈夫和孩子买吃的。这是不是很棒，锡迪？爷爷是不是很好？”

锡德里克的表情马上变得很兴奋。他看看妈妈，又望望哈维沙姆先生。

“我能现在就要吗？”他大声问道，“我能马上跑去她家给她吗？”

哈维沙姆先生给了锡德里克25美元，锡德里克立刻跑了出去。

过了一会儿，锡德里克回来了，脸上挂着灿烂的笑容。“布里奇特哭了，”他说，“她哭是因为她特别高兴。我觉得我会喜欢当伯爵的。”

老律师又微微一笑。“伯爵对此会怎么想呢？”他想，“他把钱给了孙子，这孩子又把钱给了一个穷女人付房租。”

离开纽约的日子很快到来了。在最后这些天里，方特勒罗伊爵爷非常忙碌。有了伯爵的钱，布里奇特的孩子们都有了新衣服。霍布斯先生也收到了他这位小朋友送的一块上好的金表。

“看，”锡德里克说，“这手表背面有我们俩的名字，这样你就不会忘记我了！”

霍布斯先生手里握着那块表，一时说不出话来。“我不会忘记你的，我的孩子，”最后他说，“你绝不会忘了好朋友的，对不对？”

迪克也一样，起初不知道说什么话来感谢他的小伙伴。他现在有了新刷子、一块崭新的大招牌和纽约最体面的擦鞋摊。锡迪离开前的一天，他来到锡迪家说再见。

“他要走了，我很难过，我真的很难过，”他对哈维沙姆先生说，“我从没有过像他这样的朋友。”迪克拉着锡德里克的手握了很长时间。“再见，”他说，“写信给我，跟我说说伯爵，还有那儿的一切。”

那天晚上，锡德里克的妈妈没怎么说话。

锡德里克拉着她的手。“跟我们所有的朋友，还有我们的小屋说再见真令人伤心，是不是，最最亲爱的？”他说。

“是的，亲爱的锡迪，是的，”她说，“非常，非常伤心。”

A new life in England

The ship from New York to England took eleven days, and the young Lord Fauntleroy made a lot of friends in that time. Everybody liked him, and everybody was interested in the story of his family.

Cedric learnt a new piece of the story on the ship.

'We're going to have different homes, Ceddie,' his mother told him. 'You must live in the castle with your grandfather, and I have a little house called Court Lodge not far away. You can run in and see me every day.'

Cedric could not understand this, and was very unhappy about it. 'But why?' he asked again and again.

'When you are older,' his mother said sadly, 'I can tell you. But not now.'

To Mr Havisham she said this. 'The Earl hates me, and does not want to see me. I don't want Cedric to know that, because how could he understand it? He is a loving child, and I want him and his grandfather to be friends. It is better for the Earl that way.'

'I don't like it,' Cedric said later to Mr Havisham. 'But Dearest tells me I must live with my grandfather, because, you see, all his children are dead. You must be sorry for a man when all his children are dead.'

'We're going to have different homes, Ceddie,' his mother said.

Mr Havisham smiled. He enjoyed his little talks with Cedric very much.

'Are you going to like the Earl?' he asked.

'Yes,' said Lord Fauntleroy. 'Of course a boy must like his grandfather. And he's very kind to me.'

On his first night in England Cedric stayed with his mother in her little house near the castle. But Mr Havisham went up to the castle to see the Earl.

The Earl was in a big chair by the fire. He had a bad right foot, and it gave him a lot of pain. And when his foot was painful, the Earl was even more bad-tempered than usual.

'Well, Havisham,' he said. 'What's the news?'

Mr Havisham began to tell him about the ship, but the Earl did not want to hear about that.

'Yes, yes, yes,' he said angrily. 'But what about the boy? What kind of a boy is he? Is he stupid? What does he look like? Does he talk all the time, in that stupid noisy American way?'

Mr Havisham smiled his little lawyer's smile. 'He is different from most English children, I think. But one thing, my lord. The boy knows nothing about your feelings about his mother. She said nothing to him, because she wants you and him to be friends. So, he thinks you are the kindest grandfather in the world.'

'He does, eh?' said the Earl.

'So when you speak of his mother, please be careful.'

'What kind of a boy is he? Is he stupid?' said the Earl.

'Huh!' said the Earl. 'The boy's only seven years old.'

'Those seven years were all at his mother's side,' said Mr Havisham. 'And she has all his love.'

The next afternoon the Earl's carriage carried Lord Fauntleroy and Mr Havisham up to Dorincourt Castle. At the great front door all the servants of the house waited to see the new Lord Fauntleroy, the little boy from America. When Cedric got out of the carriage, everybody had something to say about him.

'Oh, look! He's just like his father, with the same hair, the same eyes. The dear little boy!'

'And he's got his father's happy smile too – look!'

'I'm sorry for him, living with that bad-tempered old man. Nobody ever gets a kind word out of the Earl!'

'And his poor young mother, living all alone at Court Lodge, without her little boy! I'm sorry for her, too.'

Cedric smiled and said hello to everybody, in his usual friendly way, and went into the house with Mr Havisham. One of the servants, a tall young man, took Cedric to the back of the house and opened a door.

'Lord Fauntleroy, my lord,' he said.

Cedric walked down a long room to a fire at the end. There was a big chair there, and an old man in it, with white hair and black eyes.

Cedric came close to the chair. 'Are you the Earl?' he said. 'I'm your grandson. Mr Havisham brought me.' He held out his hand. 'I'm very happy to see you.'

Cedric smiled and said hello to everybody, in his usual friendly way.

The Earl shook hands with him, very surprised. He stared at the strong, beautiful little boy in front of him, with his golden curly hair and his friendly open face.

'Happy to see me, are you?' he said.

'Yes,' said Lord Fauntleroy. 'Of course. Everybody loves their family, don't they? It's exciting to meet a new grandfather. And you are very kind!'

He sat down on a chair and looked at his grandfather with great interest. The old Earl looked back at him. He did not like anybody in his family. He was bad-tempered with them all, and they all hated him.

'Kind?' he said. 'How am I kind?'

'Because of the money,' Cedric said happily. 'For Bridget, and Dick. I wanted to thank you.'

'Bridget? Dick? Who are they?' said the Earl.

And so Lord Fauntleroy told his grandfather all about his friends in New York, about Bridget and her husband and her twelve children, about Dick and Jake and the boot-black business.

The Earl of Dorincourt did not like children, and children were usually afraid of him. But Cedric was not afraid, and he talked in his usual friendly way.

'He thinks I'm his friend,' thought the Earl. 'And he wants to please me.' This was a new feeling for the Earl. Cedric was only a little boy from America, but perhaps it was nice for the Earl to see a smiling face for once.

They talked all evening, through dinner, and after dinner. In the end Cedric went to sleep in front of the fire. The Earl called a servant.

'Carry Lord Fauntleroy up to his bedroom,' he said. 'Be careful with him. The boy's tired.'

英格兰的新生活

坐船从纽约到英格兰花了十一天，这段时间方特勒罗伊小爵爷交了很多朋友。大家都喜欢他，而且人人都对他家族的故事感兴趣。

锡德里克在船上得知了一个新消息。

“我们会住在不同的地方，锡迪。”他的母亲告诉他，“你得和你爷爷一起住在城堡里，我会住在离你们不远的一栋叫洛奇公寓的小房子里。你每天都能跑来看我。”

锡德里克对此无法理解，而且很不开心。“可这是为什么啊？”他一遍又一遍地问道。

“等你长大些，”他的母亲忧伤地说，“我会告诉你，但不是现在。”

对哈维沙姆先生她说了这样一番话：“伯爵讨厌我，不想见我。我不想让锡德里克知道这些，他怎么会懂呢？他是个善良的孩子，我希望他和他的祖父成为朋友。这样对伯爵也更好些。”

“我不喜欢这样，”之后锡德里克对哈维沙姆先生说，“但是最最亲爱的告诉我，我必须和祖父一起住，因为，您知道的，他所有的孩子都死了。当一个人所有的孩子都没了，你肯定会为他感到难过的。”

哈维沙姆先生笑了。他非常喜欢和锡德里克聊天。

“你会喜欢伯爵吗？”他问道。

“会的，”方特勒罗伊爵爷说，“孙子当然要喜欢爷爷啊，而且他对我这么好。”

在英格兰的第一个晚上，锡德里克和他母亲一起住在城堡附近那所小房子里。哈维沙姆先生则去城堡见伯爵。

伯爵坐在壁炉旁的大椅子上。他的右脚不好，让他受了不少罪。每当脚痛的时候，伯爵就比平常脾气还差。

“我说，哈维沙姆，”他说，“有什么消息吗？”

哈维沙姆先生开始跟他说船上的事，但伯爵不想听那些。

“是啊，是啊，是啊，”他气呼呼地说，“但是那男孩怎么样？他是个什么样的孩子？他蠢吗？他长什么样？他是不是一直说个不停，就像又蠢又吵的美国人那样？”

哈维沙姆先生露出一丝律师的职业性微笑。“我认为他和大多数英国孩子不一样。不过有一点，老爷，这孩子对您对他母亲的看法毫不知情。他母亲什么都没跟他说，因为她希望您和他能成为朋友。所以，他觉得您是这世上最好的祖父。”

“他这么觉得，嗯？”伯爵说。

“所以您提到她母亲的时候，请注意一点。”

“哼！”伯爵说，“那孩子才七岁。”

“那七年可都是在他母亲身边，”哈维沙姆先生说，“她拥有他全部的爱。”

第二天下午，伯爵的马车载着方特勒罗伊爵爷和哈维沙姆先生来到多林考特城堡。在气派的大门前，城堡里所有的仆人都等着见见新的方特勒罗伊爵爷，这位从美国来的小男孩。当锡德里克从车里出来时，每个人都谈论起他来。

“哦，看啊！他真像他父亲，一样的头发，一样的眼睛。可爱的小男孩！”

“而且他那开心的笑容也像他父亲——瞧啊！”

“我真为他难过，他要跟那坏脾气的老头儿住在一起。没人能从伯爵那儿得到一句好话！”

“还有他可怜的母亲，年纪轻轻，一个人孤零零地住在洛奇公寓，不能和她的孩子一起！我也为她感到难过。”

锡德里克像往常一样，友好地微笑着和大家打招呼，然后和哈维沙姆先生走进房子。仆人中一个高个子的年轻人把锡德里克引到内堂，推开了一扇门。

“方特勒罗伊爵爷来了，老爷。”他说。

锡德里克走过长长的房间，来到尽头的壁炉前。那儿有张大大的椅子，上面坐着一位白头发、黑眼睛的老人。

锡德里克走近椅子。“您是伯爵吗？”他说，“我是您的孙子。哈维沙姆先生带我来的。”他伸出手，“很高兴见到您。”

伯爵和他握了握手，感到非常惊讶。他盯着面前这个结实、漂亮的小男孩，他有着金色卷发和友好坦诚的脸庞。

“见到我很高兴，是吗？”他说。

“是的，”方特勒罗伊爵爷说，“当然高兴。每个人都爱自己的家人，不是吗？要见一位从未谋面的爷爷，真让人兴奋，而且您又那么好！”

他在一张椅子上坐下，充满好奇地望着祖父。老伯爵也望着他。家里的每个人他都不喜欢。他对他们都很凶，他们也都讨厌他。

“好？”他说，“我怎么个好法？”

“因为那些钱，”锡德里克开心地说，“给了布里奇特，还有迪克的那些钱。我想谢谢您。”

“布里奇特？迪克？他们是谁？”伯爵问道。

就这样，方特勒罗伊爵爷跟他祖父讲了纽约那些朋友所有的事，有布里奇特和她的丈夫还有十二个孩子，有迪克和杰克还有擦鞋摊。

多林考特伯爵不喜欢孩子，孩子通常也都怕他。可锡德里克不怕，他还像平常一样，说话很友好。

“他觉得我是他的朋友，”伯爵想，“而且他想讨我喜欢。”这是伯爵从未有过的感觉。锡德里克只是个从美国来的小男孩，但是也许对伯爵来说，能见到一次别人的笑脸还真不错。

他们聊了一整晚，晚饭时聊，吃了晚饭接着聊。最后，锡德里克在壁炉前睡着了。伯爵叫来仆人。

“抱方特勒罗伊爵爷去他的卧室。”他说，“轻着点儿，这孩子累坏了。”

The Earl and his grandson

The next morning there were more surprises for Cedric. He had a servant, Mary, and three rooms in the castle – a room to sleep in, a room to have breakfast in, and a room full of books and toys and games. Wonderful games! Later, when he went down to the Earl in the long room, he took one of the games with him.

'Thank you very much for all the wonderful things. You're so kind!' Cedric said happily. 'This game is really good! Would you like to play it with me?'

The Earl was in a bad temper and his foot was painful. He did not give money and toys to his grandson because he had a kind heart. He gave these things because he wanted the boy to forget his mother. He opened his mouth to say, No. I don't play children's games. But he did not say it. He said, 'Very well. You can teach me.'

When the tall young servant came in with a visitor, Mr Dawson the vicar, they heard excited cries and laughing.

'That's two out! Bad luck, grandfather!'

Mr Dawson usually hated his visits to the old Earl, but today was different, and surprising.

'Good morning, Dawson,' the Earl said. 'My grandson is keeping me busy.' He put his hand on Cedric's head and nearly smiled. 'What is it today, Dawson?'

'Would you like to play this game with me?' said Cedric.

'It's Higgins of Edge Farm, my lord,' said Mr Dawson.'He can't pay his rent. He needs more time.'

Every house in the village and every farm for miles around Dorincourt all belonged to the Earl. The villagers and the farmers paid their rent to the Earl's man, Mr Newick. And Mr Newick was a hard man. Mr Dawson came to the Earl many times a year, with the same question. 'Can this family or that family have more time to pay their rent?' And the answer was always 'no'.

'Higgins?' said the Earl. 'He's a bad farmer, and he's always late with his rent, Newick tells me.'

'His wife is ill, and two of his children,' Mr Dawson said. 'And Newick wants to put them all out of the house into the street. Higgins came to me yesterday, to ask for help. Another month, he says, and he can find the rent.'

'Huh. They all say that,' said the Earl, looking angry.

Lord Fauntleroy listened to every word of this. He began to feel a great interest in Higgins and his family.

'It was the same for Bridget and her family,' he said.

The Earl jumped a little. 'I forgot you !' he said. 'I forgot we had a philanthropist in the room.' He stared at the boy for a minute. 'Come here,' he said.

Cedric went and stood next to him.

'What shall we do about Higgins, then?' said the Earl. 'Tell me.'

Mr Dawson began to feel worried. How could a seven-year-old child answer a question like that?

'What shall we do about Higgins, then?' said the Earl.

Lord Fauntleroy put his hand on his grandfather's arm. 'Well, I'm just a little boy, so what can I do? But you can do anything,' he said. 'Who's Newick?'

'He works for me,' said the Earl. 'And some of my villagers don't like him very much.'

'Are you going to write to him now?' Cedric asked. 'Shall I bring you a pen and some paper?'

In Cedric's world, there was only one answer to the question about Higgins. Of course, he must have more time. Of course, Newick must leave the family alone.

The Earl looked at him. 'Can you write?' he asked.

'Yes,' said Cedric, 'but not very well.'

'Bring the pen and paper, and you write the letter.'

Lord Fauntleroy's face went red. 'But my spelling isn't very good,' he said.

The Earl smiled a little. 'Higgins isn't interested in your spelling. I'm not the philanthropist; you are.'

And so Cedric wrote a letter to Mr Newick. It was true, the spelling was not very good.

Dear mr Newik, pleas leve mr higins alone for now, he can pay wen he is redy. Yors, Fauntleroy

Dear mr Newik, pleas leve mr higins alone for now, he can pay wen he is redy. Yors, Fauntleroy

Mr Dawson went away and took the letter for Mr Newick with him. He took a happy heart with him too. There were changes at Dorincourt Castle.

After Mr Dawson's visit, Cedric looked at the clock.

'Can I go to Dearest now?' he said to his grandfather. 'She's waiting for me.'

'There is something for you to see first,' said the Earl.

'Thank you,' said Fauntleroy, his face red again. 'But I think I must see it tomorrow. Dearest is waiting.'

'Very well,' said the Earl. Then he said, 'it's a pony.'

'A pony!' cried Fauntleroy. 'Is it a pony for me? Like the things in my room upstairs?'

'Yes,' said his grandfather. 'Would you like to see it?'

'A pony!' Fauntleroy said again. He was very excited. 'How kind you are! You give me everything. I want to see it very much, but... but there isn't time now.'

'Perhaps you can go to see your mother another time,' said the Earl. 'Tomorrow, or the day after.'

'Oh no,' said the boy. 'She thinks about me all the time, and I think about her too. I must go now.'

They went down to Court Lodge in the Earl's carriage. Cedric talked all the time, very happily.

'You're a very kind man, grandfather. You're always doing good things, and thinking about other people.' He counted on his fingers. 'Do you know, twenty-seven people are happy because of you. Twenty-seven!'

The Earl said nothing. He thought about his life – a rich, selfish, bad-tempered life, without friends or loving family. When did I say a kind word, or do a good thing? Now this child is calling me kind, and good, and I know that is not true. These were new thoughts for the Earl, and he did not like them.

'It's a pony.'

When they arrived at Court Lodge, Cedric was out of the carriage in a second, running to the front door. The Earl watched from the carriage. The door opened, and a young, pretty woman in black ran out. Cedric jumped into her arms, smiling and laughing. The Earl closed the window and his carriage drove away.

The Earl watched from the carriage.

伯爵和孙子

第二天早上，还有更多惊喜等着锡德里克。他有了仆人玛丽和城堡里的三个房间——一个房间睡觉，一个房间吃早饭，还有一个房间装满了书、玩具和游戏用具。都是些很好玩的游戏！过了一会儿他下楼去那长长的房间找伯爵，带上了其中的一副游戏棋。

“非常感谢您给了我这么多好东西。您真好！”锡德里克高兴地说，“这游戏棋特别好玩！您愿意跟我一起玩吗？”

伯爵正在气头上，而且脚很痛。他给孙子钱和玩具不是因为他心地善良。他给他这些东西是因为他希望这孩子忘记他母亲。他张口想说：不。我不玩小孩子的游戏。 可他没有这样说。他说：“好啊，你可以教我。”

后来，那个高个子的年轻男仆带了位客人进来，是牧师道森先生，他们听见了兴奋的叫声和笑声。

“两个子儿出局！您真不走运，爷爷！”

道森先生通常很不愿意来拜访老伯爵，但今天有些不同，让人意外。

“早上好，道森，”伯爵说，“我孙子正让我手忙脚乱的。”他把手放到锡德里克头上，几乎露出了笑容。“今天有什么事，道森？”

“是埃奇农场的希金斯一家，老爷，”道森先生说，“他交不了租。他需要更多时间。”

村里的每处房子和多林考特方圆几英里内的所有农场都属于伯爵。村民和农夫都要向伯爵的手下纽威克先生交租。纽威克先生是个铁石心肠的人。每年道森先生都要来找伯爵很多次，每次都带着同样的问题：“这家人或那家人能不能晚点交租？”答案永远都是“不能”。

“希金斯？”伯爵说，“纽威克告诉我说，他是个糟糕的农夫，而且总是晚交租。”

“他妻子病了，有两个孩子也病了。”道森先生说，“纽威克想把他们全都从房子里赶到大街上去。希金斯昨天来找我帮忙。他说只要再宽限一个月，他就能凑到租金了。”

“哼，他们都那么说。”伯爵说着，一脸怒气。

方特勒罗伊爵爷仔细听着他们说的每一句话，他开始十分担心希金斯和他的家人。

“布里奇特和她的家人也一样。”他说。

伯爵惊了一下。“我把你 给忘了！”他说，“我忘了这屋里有个慈善家。”他盯着小男孩看了一会儿。“过来。”他说。

锡德里克走过去，站在他身旁。

“那我们该拿希金斯怎么办呢？”伯爵说，“告诉我。”

道森先生担心起来。一个七岁的小孩会怎么回答这样的问题呢？

方特勒罗伊爵爷把手搭在祖父的胳膊上。“嗯，我只是个小孩儿，我能怎么办呢？可是您 什么都办得到。”他说，“纽威克是谁？”

“他替我办事，”伯爵说，“我的一些村民很不喜欢他。”

“您要现在给他写封信吗？”锡德里克问道，“要我给您拿纸和笔吗？”

在锡德里克的世界里，希金斯的问题就只有一个答案。当然，必须多给他些时间。当然，纽威克必须放过这一家人。

伯爵看着他。“你会写字吗？”他问道。

“会的，”锡德里克说，“但写得不是很好。”

“拿纸和笔来，你来写这封信。”

方特勒罗伊爵爷脸红了。“可我的拼写不是很好。”他说。

伯爵微微一笑。“希金斯一家人对你的拼写不感兴趣。我不是慈善家，而你是。”

就这样，锡德里克给纽威克先生写了封信。的确，他的拼写不是很好。

亲爱的纽维可先生，晴暂时方过希全斯先生，等他淮备好他会付钱的。尔的，方特勒罗伊

道森先生离开了，带着给纽威克先生的信，也带着一份好心情。多林考特城堡发生了变化。

道森先生走了以后，锡德里克看了看钟。

我能去最最亲爱的那儿了吗？”他问祖父，“她在等我。”

“有件东西你要先看看。”伯爵说。

“谢谢您，”方特勒罗伊说，他的脸又红了。“可我想我得明天再看了。最最亲爱的在等我。”

“好吧。”伯爵说。接着他又说：“是一匹小马。”

“一匹小马！”方特勒罗伊喊了出来，“是给我的小马吗？就像楼上我房间里的那些东西一样？”

“是的，”他的祖父说，“你想看一看吗？”

“一匹小马！”方特勒罗伊又说了一遍，他非常兴奋。“您真是太好啦！您给了我一切。我很想 去看看，但是……但是现在没时间了。”

“也许你可以找别的时间去看妈妈，”伯爵说，“明天，或者后天。”

“哦，不行，”这孩子说，“她一直在想我，我也想她。我现在必须去。”

他们坐着伯爵的马车来到洛奇公寓。锡德里克一路上都在讲话，非常开心。

“您真是个好人，爷爷。您总是做好事，又为他人着想。”他掰着指头算着，“您知道吗？二十七个人因为您而快乐。二十七个！”

伯爵一言未发。他在思考他的人生——富有、自私、易怒的人生，没有朋友，没有亲爱的家人。我何时说过一句好话，或做过一件好事？现在这孩子却说我善良、好心，可我知道那不是真的。 这是伯爵从未有过的想法，而他并不愿意这么想。

他们一到洛奇公寓，锡德里克就迅速下车飞奔到门口。伯爵从马车向外望去。门开了，一位年轻、美丽、穿着黑裙的女子跑了出来。锡德里克蹦到她怀里，嘻嘻哈哈地笑着。伯爵关上窗，坐着马车离开了。

News from Mr Havisham

The news went round the village and the farms faster than a carriage with six horses.

'Did you hear? The vicar went up to the castle and spoke to the Earl about poor Mr Higgins...'

'And the boy was there, little Lord Fauntleroy...'

'Yes, and the Earl said to his grandson, "You write to Mr Newick, you tell him." And the boy did!'

'And the vicar took the letter to Mr Newick, and now Mr Newick can't put poor Higgins and his family out in the street.'

'Yes, and they've got another month to find the rent!'

Days and weeks went past, and by now everybody knew about Lord Fauntleroy and his mother. They loved the boy, with his golden curly hair and his happy smile. They saw him every day on his new pony, and he always had a friendly word for everyone.

The village people loved Mrs Errol too, because of her kind heart and her sweet face. When somebody was ill in the village, Mrs Errol was always there to help.

But the Earl never saw her, never spoke to her, never went to her house. Cedric, of course, saw her every day, but his heart was sad because his 'best friend' did not live with him in the same house.

The Earl liked his little grandson more and more every week. He often forgot about his painful foot, and he began to smile more; sometimes he even laughed. He liked to please his grandson. When Lord Fauntleroy wanted new houses for some very poor villagers, the Earl built new houses. When the boy wanted to talk about his mother, the Earl listened. But he did not like it.

'Do you never forget about your mother?' he said to his grandson one day.

'No,' said Cedric. 'Never. And she never forgets about me. I don't forget about you , you know, when I'm away.'

The young lord did not forget his friends in America either. Letters went to and from New York, and Dick and Mr Hobbs heard all about Cedric's new life.

One day the Earl gave a great party, and all the important families for miles around came to it – to meet Lord Fauntleroy. Mr Havisham came from London too, but he was very quiet all evening, and looked worried.

At the end of the party, the Earl spoke to him.

'Well, Havisham, what's the matter?'

'I bring some bad news, my lord, about your heir.'

'My heir? Fauntleroy is my heir. What do you mean?'

Cedric was sad because his mother did not live with him.

'My lord,' said Mr Havisham. 'Cedric Errol is not your heir. He is not Lord Fauntleroy. The true Lord Fauntleroy is the son of your oldest son Bevis, and at the moment he is in London with his mother.'

The Earl's face was as white as his hair. 'Bevis?' he said.' This isn't true. Havisham, tell me this isn't true!'

'A woman came to my office this morning,' said Mr Havisham. 'Bevis married her six years ago in London. She has all the papers. He left her after a year, but she had a son. He's now five years old. The woman is American. She's beautiful, but... well, she can only just write her name. And she's only interested in the money.'

The Earl's face was now dark red. He jumped up from his chair and began to walk up and down the room.

'Bevis was always the worst!' he said angrily. 'I hated him, and he hated me. I must stop this! Cedric is very dear to me, Havisham, very dear. He's a fine boy, and he's going to be a better Earl of Dorincourt than me – or any child of Bevis's!'

Far away in New York, two of Cedric's friends sat round a table in a grocery store. They ate a supper of bread and cold meat, and talked about Lord Fauntleroy.

Dick usually came round to the grocery store once a week. He and Mr Hobbs were now good friends, and they enjoyed reading the letters from England, and talking about them. When they wrote back to Cedric, Mr Hobbs helped Dick with his writing, because writing was difficult for Dick.

The Earl began to walk up and down the room.

'I didn't get much time for school, see,' Dick told Mr Hobbs one day. 'Pa and Ma were dead, and there was no money. So me and my brother worked.'

'That was your brother Ben, was it?' Mr Hobbs said.

'Yeah, my older brother,' said Dick. 'He was good to me, Ben was. But then he married this girl, and oh dear, she was bad news! She was a good-looking girl – big black eyes, long black hair – but she was always angry about something or somebody, me or Ben or the baby. I remember, she broke a plate on Ben's head once. She hit the baby too. A nice mother she was!'

'Women!' said Mr Hobbs. 'Best to keep away from them, I say. I never married.'

'Well, she didn't stay long,' Dick said. 'She was angry with Ben because he didn't make money faster. So one day she left, with the baby. We never saw her again. She left New York, someone told us.'

'What happened to your brother?' Mr Hobbs asked.

'Ben's out in California now, working with horses on a big farm somewhere. He was sad about Minna and his baby son for a long time, poor old Ben.'

After supper, Mr Hobbs took out a letter. 'This came from our friend today,' he said. 'Let's read it together now.' He opened the letter and they began to read.

Mr Hobbs opened the letter and they began to read.

My dear frend Mr Hobbs – i have some surprising news to tel you and Dick. I am not lord fauntleroy becaus my uncle Bevis (he is dead) had a litle boy but nobody knew about him. my uncle Bevis was the oldest son of the earl and so his son is lord fauntleroy and i am just Cedric Errol again. my papa was the youngest son and youngest sons don't have anything so i am not very rich and i am going to learn to work prhaps with horses because i like them a lot. my grandfarther is very angry about it and i never saw him angry before. with love from yor old frend Cedric Errol (not lord fauntleroy).

'No, I didn't,' said Dick. 'But I know one thing. Young Cedric needs his friends at a time like this. Let's write back to him, Mr Hobbs, and let's do it now!'

哈维沙姆先生带来的消息

消息在村子和农场里传开了，传得比六驾马车还快。

“你听说了吗？牧师去城堡跟伯爵说可怜的希金斯先生的事……”

“当时那孩子就在那儿，方特勒罗伊小爵爷……”

“是啊，伯爵跟他孙子说，‘你给纽威克先生写信，你告诉他。’那孩子就那么做了！”

“然后牧师把信拿给纽威克先生，现在纽威克先生不能把可怜的希金斯和他的家人赶到大街上去了。”

“是啊，他们还能有一个月的时间去凑租金呢！”

日子就这么一天天，一周周地过去了。现在人人都知道了方特勒罗伊爵爷和他的母亲。他们喜爱这个有着金色卷发、灿烂笑容的孩子。他们每天都看见他骑着新得的小马，他也总是友好地和每个人说上几句话。

村里人也都喜爱埃罗尔太太，因为她心地善良，面容甜美。村里要是有人生病了，埃罗尔太太总是去帮忙。

可是伯爵从不见她，从不跟她讲话，也从不去她住的地方。锡德里克当然每天都去看她，但他心里很难过，因为他“最好的朋友”没有和他住在一起。

随着时间的推移，伯爵越来越喜欢他的小孙子。他经常忘记脚痛，也开始有更多的笑容，有时候甚至是大笑了。他喜欢逗他孙子开心。方特勒罗伊爵爷希望一些特别穷的村民能有新房子，伯爵就建新房子。这孩子想聊关于他母亲的事，伯爵就听着。但是他并不喜欢听这些事。

“你从来不会 忘记你妈妈吗？”有一天他问孙子。

“不会，”锡德里克说，“永远不会。她也永远不会忘记我。您知道，我不在您身边的时候，我也不会忘记您 。”

小爵爷也没有忘记他在美国的朋友。书信来往于多林考特和纽约之间，迪克和霍布斯先生知道了有关锡德里克新生活的一切。

一天，伯爵举办了一场盛大的宴会，方圆几英里内所有有声望的家族都来了——来见一见方特勒罗伊爵爷。哈维沙姆先生也从伦敦过来了，可他整晚一言不发，而且看上去十分焦虑。

宴会快结束的时候，伯爵对他说：

“对了，哈维沙姆，出了什么事吗？”

“我有个坏消息，老爷，是关于您的继承人的。”

“我的继承人？方特勒罗伊就是我的继承人。你什么意思？”

“老爷，”哈维沙姆先生说，“锡德里克·埃罗尔不是您的继承人。他不是方特勒罗伊爵爷。真正的方特勒罗伊爵爷是您长子贝维斯的儿子，此刻他正和母亲一起在伦敦。”

伯爵的脸色像他的头发一样白。“贝维斯？”他说，“这不是真的。哈维沙姆，告诉我这不是真的！”

“今天早上一位女士来到我办公室，”哈维沙姆先生说，“贝维斯六年前在伦敦娶了她。她有所有的证明文件。他一年后离开了她，但是她有个儿子，现在五岁。这位女士是美国人。她很美，不过……唉，她只会写自己的名字。而且她只对钱感兴趣。”

伯爵的脸色发紫。他从椅子上跳起来，开始在房间里走来走去。

“贝维斯一直是最没出息的！”他生气地说，“我讨厌他，他也讨厌我。我必须阻止这件事！锡德里克对我来说很珍贵，哈维沙姆，非常珍贵。他是个优秀的孩子，他将成为比我——或贝维斯的什么孩子——更好的多林考特伯爵！”

远在纽约，锡德里克的两位朋友正坐在食品杂货店里的一张桌子前。他们晚餐吃了面包和冷肉，然后谈起了方特勒罗伊爵爷。

迪克通常一周来一次食品杂货店。他和霍布斯先生现在是很好的朋友，他们喜欢一起看从英格兰寄来的信，一起聊一聊信的内容。他们给锡德里克回信时，霍布斯先生会帮助迪克，因为写字对迪克来说有难度。

“看，我没什么时间上学，”一天，迪克告诉霍布斯先生说，“爸和妈都死了，家里也没有钱。所以我和我兄弟只能工作。”

“你的兄弟本，是吗？”霍布斯先生问道。

“对，他是我哥哥，”迪克说，“他对我很好，我是说本。但是后来他娶了这个姑娘，哦，天哪，她就是场噩梦！她是个俏姑娘——大大的黑眼睛，长长的黑头发——可她不是看什么不顺眼，就是冲人发火，冲我、本或宝宝。我记得有一次她拿盘子砸本的脑袋。她还打宝宝呢。她可真是个好妈啊！”

“女人啊！”霍布斯先生说，“叫我说，最好离得她们远远的。我就没结过婚。”

“嗯，她也没呆多久，”迪克说，“她总是跟本生气，因为他赚钱不够快。所以有一天她带着孩子走了。我们再没见过她。有人跟我们说，她离开了纽约。”

“那你哥哥怎么样了？”霍布斯先生问道。

“本也走了，现在在加利福尼亚，在一个什么地方的大农场干照料马的活儿。他为明娜和他的宝贝儿子难过了好长一段时间，可怜的本。”

晚饭后，霍布斯先生拿出一封信。“这是我们朋友的来信，今天到的，”他说，“咱们现在一起看吧。”他打开信，一起读了起来。

我亲爱的盆友霍布斯先生——我有个令人吃惊的消息要高诉你和迪克。我不是方特勒罗伊爵爷了，因为我伯伯贝维斯（他去世了）有个而子，但没人知道他。我伯伯贝维斯是伯爵的大儿子，所以他儿子才是方特勒罗伊爵爷，而我又是锡德里克·埃罗尔了。我爸爸是最小的儿子，最小的儿子什么也得不到，所以我没那么有钱了。我要开始学着工作了，也许是跟马打交道吧，因为我很喜欢它们。我爷爷对此很生气，我从没见过他生气。爱尔们的老盆友锡德里克·埃罗尔（不是方特勒罗伊爵爷）。

“哎哟！”霍布斯先生说，“哎哟，我不知道。你听说过这种事吗？”

“没，没听过。”迪克说，“不过我知道一点，就是这种时候，小锡德里克需要他的朋友。我们给他回信吧，霍布斯先生，现在就写！”

News from America

The story about the new Lord Fauntleroy was soon in all the newspapers in England. And in Dorincourt village, of course, nobody could stop talking about it.

'The Earl is so angry about it! He doesn't like the woman, and he doesn't want the boy!'

'Yes, and they say he's got twenty lawyers in London, all working on it, looking into things, asking questions.'

'Did you see the woman, Bevis's wife, when she came to the castle with her boy? She's a tall, black-eyed thing, with a hard face. Not a nice woman, and nothing like our sweet, kind Mrs Errol. And the boy's nothing, when you think about our dear little lord.'

'How's it all going to end?'

'Who knows?'

When the Earl told Lord Fauntleroy the news, the boy listened carefully. Then he asked, with a worried look in his big brown eyes:

'Can they take Dearest's house away from her?'

'No !' the Earl said. 'They can take nothing from her.'

'Ah,' said Cedric. 'I'm so pleased about that.' He thought for a minute, then looked up at his grandfather.

In Dorincourt village nobody could stop talking about it.

'And... that other boy,' he said, a little shakily, 'he's going to be your boy now, and live with you, isn't he?'

'NO !' the Earl said again. 'No, he's not!'

Cedric was very surprised. He jumped up from his chair and began to smile. 'Can I still be your boy, then? I'm not going to be an Earl one day, but that doesn't matter, does it? I just want to be your boy, always.'

The Earl looked down at his little grandson. 'My boy!' he said, and – this is true – his voice was a little shaky too. And there was something in those old angry black eyes, something new, something different. 'Yes, you're my boy, my only boy, the best boy in my life.'

Cedric's face went red, and he looked very happy. 'That's all right, then. I was a little worried, but not now.'

The Earl put his hand on the boy's head. 'You are right for Dorincourt, and... well, who knows? But always remember, you are my boy, first and last.'

The Earl talked many times with Mr Havisham about Bevis's wife and son, and Mr Havisham talked with other lawyers in London. There were questions about the woman's story. When was her son born? Where was he born? She was Bevis's wife, because she had the marriage papers, but was all her story true?

Some days later a visitor came to Court Lodge. The servant, her eyes big with surprise, ran to find Mrs Errol.

'It's the Earl, Mrs Errol!' she said. 'The Earl's here!'

When Mrs Errol came into her sitting room, she found a tall old man with white hair. He stared at her.

'The boy is very like you,' he said.

'People say that, my lord,' Mrs Errol said.

'You don't want your son to be the Earl of Dorincourt, do you?' the Earl said.

'It's a fine thing to be an Earl,' said Mrs Errol quietly. 'But it's more important for my son to be a true, kind, brave man, like his father.'

'Not like his grandfather, you mean,' said the Earl.

'I don't know his grandfather.' Mrs Errol looked up into his face. 'But I know that Cedric loves you.'

The Earl began to walk up and down the room. 'Yes, and the boy is very dear to me,' he said. 'I'm an old man, tired of life, but then I found someone to live for. And now this other boy... Havisham told you about him.' He came back and stood in front of Mrs Errol.

'I am miserable,' he said. 'Miserable!'

Again, his voice was a little shaky. 'I hated you once. I don't know why. I came to see you because you are like the boy, and the boy loves you, and I love him. Be kind to me, because of the boy.'

Mrs Errol had a kind, loving heart. She put her hand on the Earl's arm. 'Why don't you sit down for a moment? You are tired, and unhappy.'

'It's more important for my son to be a true, kind, brave man, like his father,' said Mrs Errol.

The Earl sat down, and they drank tea together, and talked. He watched her sweet face and listened to her quiet voice, and he began to feel a little better. Before he went away, he looked around the room.

'This is a happy room,' he said. 'Can I come again and talk to you?'

'Of course, my lord. Come when you like.'

The English newspapers could not stop writing about the Lord Fauntleroy story. And soon American newspapers began to write about it too. Mr Hobbs read everything, and he and Dick talked about it every day.

Dick was a very good boot-black, and a lot of people came to him. One of them was a young lawyer, and one day he gave Dick his newspaper. 'Here's a paper for you, Dick,' he said. 'This one's got pictures in it – an English castle, and this English Earl, and his son's wife. Well, she says she's his son's wife, but the Earl says not. I don't – hey, Dick, what's the matter?'

Dick stared at the picture in the newspaper with his mouth open. He saw a good-looking young woman, with black eyes and a lot of long black hair.

'I know her!' he cried. 'I know her like the back of my hand. It's Minna! It's my brother Ben's wife.' He began to put away his brushes.

'Where are you going, Dick?' said the young lawyer.

'I'm off to my friend Mr Hobbs,' cried Dick. 'We've got business to do.'

Dick stared at the picture in the newspaper with his mouth open.

And away he ran through the streets of New York to Mr Hobbs's grocery store. At first, Mr Hobbs could not understand it. 'But why did Minna do it?' he asked.

'Money!' said Dick. 'She always wanted money. She married this Bevis, the Earl's son, for money. And now she wants to get our Cedric's money. Well, she's not going to! You and me, Mr Hobbs, are going to stop her!'

Then Mr Hobbs and Dick began to think carefully.

'Dick, you write to Ben, and I'm going to write to Cedric,' said Mr Hobbs. 'And that Mr Havisham too.'

'Right,' said Dick. 'But we need help here, Mr Hobbs. This is lawyers' work. Why don't I ask that young lawyer, him with the newspaper?'

Dick's friend the young lawyer was very surprised by the story, but very interested. He began to get busy too, and letters went to California, to London, and to Dorincourt.

shaky adj . shaking because you have strong feelings or are afraid 颤抖的

美国传来的消息

新方特勒罗伊爵爷的消息很快出现在英格兰所有的报纸上。在多林考特村，自然无人不在谈论这件事。

“伯爵因为这事儿非常生气！他不喜欢那个女人，也不想要那个男孩！”

“是啊，他们说他在伦敦找了二十个律师，都在忙乎这事儿，到处查、到处问。”

“贝维斯的老婆带孩子来城堡的时候你看见那女人什么样了吗？是个高个子，眼睛是黑色的，板着个脸。不像个好女人，一点儿也比不上我们温柔善良的埃罗尔太太。比起我们亲爱的小爵爷，她那孩子也是一无是处。”

“这事儿最后会怎么样啊？”

“天知道！”

伯爵把这消息告诉方特勒罗伊爵爷的时候，小男孩认真听着，棕色的大眼睛里充满担忧，然后他问：

“他们会把最最亲爱的房子拿走吗？”

“不会 ！”伯爵说，“他们什么都不能从她那儿拿走。”

“啊，”锡德里克说，“那样的话，我太高兴了。”他想了想，抬头望着他的祖父。

“那……那个男孩儿，”他声音有点发颤，“他现在要成为您的孙子，和您一起住，对吗？”

“不会 ！”伯爵又一次说道，“不，他不会！”

锡德里克十分惊讶。他从椅子上跳下来，露出笑脸。“那，我还能是您孙子吗？我以后不能当伯爵了，但是没关系，不是吗？我只想当您的孙子，永远。”

伯爵低头看着他的小孙子。“我的孩子！”他说，并且——千真万确——他的 声音也有点颤抖了。那双苍老、易怒的黑色眼睛里有些什么东西，一些从未有过的、不一样的东西。“是的，你是我的孙子，我唯一的孙子，这辈子最好的孙子。”

锡德里克的脸红了，他看上去非常幸福。“那就好啦，我本来有些担心，但现在不了。”

伯爵把手放在孩子头上。“你才适合多林考特，而且……哎，谁知道呢？不过永远记住，你是我的孙子，是第一个，也是最后一个。”

伯爵多次和哈维沙姆先生讨论有关贝维斯的妻子和孩子的事，哈维沙姆先生再和伦敦的其他律师谈。这个女人的故事有不少疑点。她儿子是什么时候出生的？在哪里出生的？她是贝维斯的妻子，是因为她有结婚证明文件，可是她说的都是真的吗？

几天后，一位客人来到洛奇公寓。女仆惊讶地睁大了眼睛，跑去找埃罗尔太太。

“是伯爵，埃罗尔太太！”她说，“伯爵来了！”

埃罗尔太太走进客厅，看到一位高大的老人，满头白发。他盯着她看。

“那孩子很像你。”他说。

“大家都那么说，老爷。”埃罗尔太太说。

“你不希望你的孩子成为多林考特伯爵，是吗？”伯爵说。

“能成为伯爵是件好事，”埃罗尔太太平静地说，“但是更重要的是，我的儿子能成为一个真诚、善良、勇敢的人，像他爸爸一样。”

“你的意思是，不是像他爷爷一样。”伯爵说。

“我不了解他的爷爷。”埃罗尔太太抬头望着他的脸，“但我知道锡德里克爱您。”

伯爵在屋里来回走了起来。“是的，而且这孩子对我来说很珍贵。”他说，“我是个老头子，厌倦了生活，可后来我找到了一个人，我愿意为了他活着。但现在这另外一个孩子……哈维沙姆跟你说了吧。”他走回到埃罗尔太太面前停住。

“我很痛苦，”他说，“很痛苦！”

他的声音再一次颤抖。“我曾经恨过你。我不知道为什么。我来看你是因为你像那孩子，而且那孩子爱你，而我又爱他。看在孩子的份上，对我好一些。”

埃罗尔太太有一颗善良、慈爱的心。她把手放在伯爵的手臂上。“您坐一会儿吧？您累了，又不太开心。”

伯爵坐下来，他们一起喝茶聊天。他望着她甜美的脸庞，听着她轻柔的声音，开始感觉好了一些。走之前，他环顾四周。

“这是个令人愉快的屋子，”他说，“我还能来跟你聊天吗？”

“当然，老爷。您随时都可以来。”

英国的报纸在不停地报道方特勒罗伊爵爷的消息。很快美国报纸也开始报道了。霍布斯先生看了所有的消息，他和迪克每天都讨论这件事。

迪克是个擦皮鞋的好手，很多人都来找他。其中有一位是名年轻的律师。这天他递给迪克一份报纸。“这是给你的报纸，迪克，”他说，“这上面有照片——这是英国城堡、那个英国伯爵和他的儿媳。呃，她说她是伯爵的儿媳，但伯爵说不是。我不——嘿，迪克，你怎么了？”

迪克盯着报纸上的照片，张大了嘴。他看见一个年轻漂亮的女人，黑色眼睛，一头茂密的黑色长发。

“我认得她！”他喊了起来，“我对她再清楚不过了。这是明娜！是我哥哥本的老婆。”他开始收拾刷子。

“你要去哪儿，迪克？”那位年轻律师问道。

“我要去我朋友霍布斯先生那儿，”迪克大声说，“我们有正事儿要做。”

于是他穿过纽约的街道，一路跑到霍布斯先生的食品杂货店。一开始，霍布斯先生不太理解。“可明娜为什么要这么做？”他问道。

“为了钱啊！”迪克说，“她一直想要钱。她嫁给这个伯爵的儿子贝维斯是为了他的钱，现在她又想要咱们锡德里克的钱。哼，她是不会得逞的！霍布斯先生，我俩一定要阻止她！”

随后霍布斯先生和迪克开始仔细考虑这件事。

“迪克，你给本写信，我来给锡德里克写，”霍布斯先生说，“还有那个哈维沙姆先生。”

“好，”迪克说，“不过我们需要帮助，霍布斯先生。这是律师的活儿。我要不去问问那个年轻的律师，给我看报纸的那个？”

迪克年轻的律师朋友听了整个故事，非常惊讶，但也很感兴趣。他也开始忙乎起来，于是信件寄去了加利福尼亚、伦敦和多林考特。

Changes at the castle

Wonderful things always happen quickly. Letters went to and from America and England, and soon Mr Hobbs, Dick, and Dick's brother Ben were on a ship to England.

Things happened quickly because Minna – and it was Minna – was a bad woman, and a stupid one too. When she married Bevis, the Earl's son, she was still Ben's wife, and you can't have two husbands. Her son Tom was eight years old, not five, so he was Ben's son, not Bevis's son.

She was in a sitting room in the Dorincourt Hotel when the end came. The door opened, and in came three people – Mr Havisham, a big young man, and the Earl of Dorincourt. Minna jumped to her feet with a cry.

'Do you know this woman?' Mr Havisham said to the big young man.

'Yes,' said Ben. 'I know her and she knows me.'

And that was the end of Minna. She left the hotel and nobody ever saw her again. Ben took his son Tom back to California with him, and with the Earl's help he bought a little farm there.

When the Earl left the hotel, he went at once to his carriage. 'To Court Lodge,' he said to his servant.

He came into the sitting room at Court Lodge and found Cedric with his mother. The Earl looked taller and younger, and there was a smile in his black eyes. He looked at his grandson.

'So here,' he said, 'is Lord Fauntleroy.'

Mrs Errol stood up. 'Oh, is he truly Lord Fauntleroy?' she asked. The Earl took her hand.

'Yes,' he answered, 'he is.' Then he put his other hand on Cedric's head.

'Fauntleroy,' he said, 'ask your mother this. When is she coming to us at the castle?'

Lord Fauntleroy put his arms round his mother. 'To live with us,' he cried. 'To live with us always!'

Mrs Errol looked at the Earl with her sweet, sad eyes.

'We need you,' the Earl said. 'We need you very much.'

Dick and Mr Hobbs did not go back to America at once. The Earl had a talk with Dick, and Dick went back to school, in England this time. His writing got much better, and he began to study to be a lawyer.

Mr Hobbs liked England very much. In the end he opened a new shop in Dorincourt, and was an important person in the village. People at the castle, of course, always went to his shop, and Cedric was in and out every day, to see his old friend.

'Are you ever going back to America?' Dick asked Mr Hobbs when he visited one day.

'I don't think so,' Mr Hobbs said. 'I like to be near the boy, you see. He's a fine little lord, young Cedric.'

'To live with us,' Cedric cried.'To live with us always!'

城堡中的变化

好事来得总是那么快。信件来往于美国和英格兰之间，很快霍布斯先生、迪克和迪克的哥哥本就搭上了前往英格兰的轮船。

事情进展迅速，因为明娜——就是 那个明娜——是个坏女人，也是个蠢女人。她嫁给贝维斯，也就是伯爵儿子的时候，她还是本的妻子，可一个人是不能有两位丈夫的。她的儿子汤姆已经八岁大了，而不是五岁，所以他是本的儿子，而不是贝维斯的儿子。

结局到来的时候，明娜正坐在多林考特旅馆的客厅里。门被推开，进来三个人——哈维沙姆先生、一个大块头的年轻人和多林考特伯爵。明娜尖叫着跳了起来。

“你认识这个女人吗？”哈维沙姆先生问大块头的年轻人。

“是的，”本说，“我认得她，她也认得我。”

这便是明娜的结局。她离开旅馆，没人再见过她。本带儿子汤姆回了加利福尼亚，并且在伯爵的帮助下在那儿买了个小农场。

伯爵离开旅馆后，立刻走向马车。“去洛奇公寓。”他对仆人说。

他走进洛奇公寓的客厅，找到锡德里克和他的妈妈。伯爵看上去更高了，而且年轻了，黑色的眼睛里带着笑意。他看着他的孙子。

“那么这位，”他说，“就是方特勒罗伊爵爷。”

埃罗尔太太站起身来。“哦，他真的是方特勒罗伊爵爷吗？”她问道。伯爵握住她的手。

“是的，”他回答，“他是。”然后他把另一只手放到锡德里克头上。

“方特勒罗伊，”他说，“问问你妈妈，她什么时候到城堡来跟我们一起住？”

方特勒罗伊爵爷抱住妈妈。“跟我们一起住，”他喊道，“永远跟我们住在一起！”

埃罗尔太太用她温柔、忧伤的眼睛望着伯爵。

“我们需要你，”伯爵说，“我们非常需要你。”

迪克和霍布斯先生没有立即回美国。伯爵和迪克谈了谈，于是迪克重返校园了，这次是在英国。他的写作水平好多了，并且开始学习，想成为一名律师。

霍布斯先生很喜欢英格兰。最后，他在多林考特开了家新店，而且成了村里的一位重要人物。城堡里的人当然总是光顾他的店，锡德里克更是每天进进出出，看望他的老朋友。

“你还打算回美国吗？”迪克有天来看霍布斯先生的时候问他。

“我想不会了。”霍布斯先生说，“我喜欢在那孩子身边，你懂的。小锡德里克是位优秀的小爵爷。”

THE LOTTERY WINNER

Just think. You win five million pounds in the lottery – suddenly you are rich! What are you going to do with all that money? You can buy clothes, cars, houses; you can go to New York, London, Moscow, Paris, Madrid...

Jason Williams is a very happy young man. He has a winning lottery ticket – and a cheque for five million pounds. But other people want his money too. His mother, his father, his wife, and his lawyer. Jason is in trouble with the police. He needs a lawyer's help, and lawyers are expensive. And then there's Emma Carter.

Emma Carter is very angry and unhappy. She says that it is her ticket, and that she won the lottery, not Jason Williams. Emma Carter has a lawyer too, because she wants her five million pounds, and she wants it now.

So who's going to get the money? Where did Jason get the winning lottery ticket from? Who is telling the truth – and who is telling lies?

The bag-snatcher

One Saturday afternoon in a small town, Emma Carter came out of a shoe shop with some new shoes. They were cheap shoes, but Emma was very pleased with them. She was seventy-three years old and did not have much money. She began to walk home. 'A nice cup of tea,' she thought, 'and then I can go for a walk in my new shoes.'

It was a quiet town and there was nobody in the street. Suddenly, Emma heard something behind her. She did not have time to look, because just then somebody ran up behind her, hit her on the head, and snatched her bag out of her hands. Emma fell down on her back. Then she looked up, and saw a tall young man with long, dirty brown hair. He stood and looked down at her for a second; then he ran away with Emma's bag under his arm.

He ran away with Emma's bag under his arm.

'Help! Help!' Emma cried.

But nobody came, and after two or three minutes Emma slowly got up and went to the nearest house. The people there were very kind. They gave Emma a cup of tea, and soon an ambulance came and took her to hospital.

At the hospital a doctor looked at Emma's head and back. 'You're going to be OK,' he said. 'Just take it easy for a day or two. Can your husband help you at home?'

'My husband died eight years ago,' said Emma. 'There's only me at home.'

'Well,' the doctor said, 'we don't want you to feel ill and fall downstairs at home. So I think you must stay in hospital for tonight, and perhaps tomorrow night, too.' Later, a policeman came to the hospital and Emma told him about the bag-snatcher.

Emma made a picture of the young man's face.

'Did anybody see this young man?' he asked.

'I don't know,' said Emma. 'But there was nobody in the street when I called for help.'

'Oh dear,' the policeman said. 'What was in your bag?'

'A little money – and a lottery ticket,' said Emma. 'I buy a ticket every Saturday. Then on Saturday evening I watch the lottery on television. I always have the same numbers –5, 12, 23, 24, 38, 41. All those numbers are important to me. I was born on 5th December, 1923. I lived at number 24 Sandwich Road for 38 years...'

'Yes, yes,' said the policeman. 'I understand.' He wrote everything down in a little black book. 'Did you see the man's face?' he asked.

'Yes,' said Emma. 'I did. I fell on my back, and he looked down at me for a second. So I saw his face.'

The policeman opened a small bag. In it there were a lot of pictures of eyes and ears, hair and mouths. 'I need a picture of the man's face. Can you help me?' he said.

'Yes,' said Emma. 'He was tall and he had long, dirty brown hair. He wore blue trousers and a white shirt with a picture of a footballer. He had brown eyes...' Carefully she took the small pictures and made a big picture of the young man's face. She checked the picture carefully.

'What colour were his shoes?' asked the policeman.

Shoes! Suddenly Emma remembered her new shoes. Where were they? She told the policeman about her shoes, but then she began to cry and could not stop.

A nurse came up to Emma's bed. 'Please go now,' she said to the policeman. 'Mrs Carter needs to sleep.'

抢包的歹徒

一座小城的星期六下午，埃玛·卡特拿着双新鞋走出了鞋店。鞋子很便宜，不过埃玛很满意。她73岁了，没什么钱。她开始往家走。“喝杯好茶，”她想，“然后我可以穿着新鞋子散散步。”

这是座安静的小城，街上没有人。突然，埃玛听到身后有动静。她来不及看，因为就在此时有人飞速地从她身后跑来，照她头上一击，从她手里抢走了包。埃玛仰面摔倒在地。随后她抬眼望去，看到一个高个子的年轻人，顶着一头脏兮兮的棕色长发。他站着低头看了埃玛一眼，便用胳膊夹着她的包跑了。

“救命！救命！”埃玛喊道。

但是没人过来。两三分钟后，埃玛慢慢地站起来，向离得最近的人家走去。那家人很友善，他们给了埃玛一杯茶，很快救护车就来了，把她送到了医院。

在医院里，一位医生检查了埃玛的头和后背。“你会好起来的。”他说，“只需休息一两天。你丈夫能在家照顾你吗？”

“我丈夫八年前就死了。”埃玛说，“家里只有我一人。”

“好吧，”医生说，“我们可不想你在家生病或摔下楼梯。所以我认为你今晚必须呆在医院，或许明晚也是。”过了不久，一名警察来到医院，埃玛将抢包歹徒的情况告诉了他。

“有人看到这个年轻人吗？”他问。

“我不知道。”埃玛说，“不过我喊救命时，街上没人。”

“哎呀！”警察说，“你包里有什么？”

“有一点钱，还有一张彩票。”埃玛说，“我每周六都会买一张彩票，然后周六晚上看电视上的彩票开奖。我总是买同样的号码——5，12，23，24，38，41。这些数字对我来说都很重要。我的生日是1923年12月5日，我在桑威奇路24号住了38年……”

“好的，好的。”警察说，“我知道了。”他把这些都记在一个小黑本上。“你看到那个人的脸了吗？”他问。

“是的，”埃玛说，“我看到了。我仰面摔在地上，他低头看了我一眼，所以我看到了他的脸。”

警察打开了一个小袋子，里面有很多张眼睛、耳朵、头发和嘴的图片。“我需要那个人的脸部图片。你能帮我吗？”他说。

“可以。”埃玛说，“他个子高高的，有一头脏兮兮的棕色长发。他穿着蓝裤子和一件白色衬衫，衬衫上印有一个足球运动员的图像。他的眼睛是棕色的……”她认真地挑着小图片，拼出了那个年轻人的脸。她仔细地核对了拼图。

“他的鞋是什么颜色的？”警察问道。

鞋！突然，埃玛想起了她新买的鞋。它们在哪儿？她把鞋的事情告诉了警察，然后便哭了起来，难以自持。

一位护士来到埃玛的床前。“现在请离开吧。”她对警察说，“卡特太太需要休息。”

The winning ticket.

Jason Williams came home and sat down on his bed. He was twenty-two years old. He lived with his father and mother in three small rooms at the top of a tall building. Every day he went out, but he did not go to work. Jason stole things. Sometimes he stole things from shops or cars; and sometimes he stole money from old people like Emma Carter. Today he was angry.

'I took that old woman's bag,' he thought. 'What did I get? Two pounds, seventy-four pence, and a lottery ticket! And it was an old, cheap bag too.'

'Two pounds, seventy-four pence, and a lottery ticket!'

Jason knew about lottery tickets. He bought five tickets every weekend. He put Emma's lottery ticket in his pocket and forgot about it. Then he went out for a drink.

At the hospital a nurse put Emma to bed in a room with five other women. There was a television in the room, and at eight o'clock everybody watched the lottery. For a minute Emma watched too, but she felt very tired and soon she closed her eyes and slept. So she did not hear the winning numbers for that week's lottery...

On Sunday at twelve o'clock Jason got out of bed and made some tea. Then he opened his father's newspaper and found the winning lottery numbers: 5, 12, 23, 24, 38, 41. He checked his five lottery tickets. 'No good!' he said.

Then he remembered the old woman's ticket and checked those numbers too: 5, 12, 23, 24, 38, 41. He checked them three times. Six winning numbers!

'I'm a winner!' he said. He kissed the ticket. Then he ran into the living-room and kissed his mother.

'Here, what's the matter, Jason?' said Lily Williams. Jason sometimes hit her, but he did not usually kiss her. Her cigarette fell out of her mouth.

'The lottery! I'm this week's winner, Mum! Look – six winning numbers. I'm rich!'

'I'm this week's winner, Mum! I'm rich!'

Jason's father came into the living-room. 'What's all this noise?' he said.

'Joe, Joe!' said Lily. 'Jason's got six winning numbers in the lottery. We're rich!'

'Wrong!' said Jason. 'I'm rich.'

His mother and father began to speak at the same time. But Jason did not listen. He went out to the telephone box in the street and made a very important telephone call.

On Monday morning a policeman came to the hospital with Emma's new shoes.

'A little girl found them in the street and took them to the police station,' he said.

'How kind of her!' said Emma.

'We found your bag too,' said the policeman. 'But there's nothing in it, Mrs Carter. I'm sorry.'

'It doesn't matter,' said Emma. 'I'm very pleased to have the bag. My son gave it to me a long time ago. He lives in Australia, but he telephones me every week... And now I've got my new shoes too. Thank you very much.' Suddenly she felt happier.

That evening an ambulance took Emma home. She made a cup of tea and sat down to watch the television news.

The newsreader smiled into Emma's living-room.

'And now for this week's lottery winner. The winning numbers were: 5, 12, 23, 24, 38, 41. And here is the man with the winning ticket – Jason Williams! Jason is twenty-two and now he's a rich man. He's got a cheque from Sunshine Lotteries for five million pounds. That's a lot of money! Well, Jason, how are you feeling tonight?'

'Wonderful!'

'And what are you going to do with your money?' 'Oh, I'm going to buy a house with fifty rooms, and a big expensive car. I'm going to go to New York, Miami...'

Emma looked at the young man on the television. Jason Williams had a big smile on his face, but he had long, dirty brown hair, brown eyes... Emma sat up quickly. 'That's the man!' she thought. 'I remember his face. He hit me and snatched my bag, and stole my lottery ticket – my winning ticket, with my winning numbers!'

She got up and went to the telephone. 'Hullo – police?' she said.

中奖的彩票

贾森·威廉斯回到家，坐在床上。他22岁，和父母住在一栋高楼顶层的三间小屋里。他每天出门，但不是去工作，而是去行窃。有时他从商店或汽车里偷东西，有时从像埃玛·卡特这样的老人那里偷钱。今天他很生气。

“我抢了那个老女人的包，”他想，“我得到了什么？两英镑74便士，还有一张彩票！这个包还又旧又不值钱。”

贾森也玩彩票。他每周末都买五张彩票。他把埃玛的彩票放在口袋里，就不再去管它了。然后他出去想喝上一杯。

医院里，一位护士将埃玛安置在一间病房的病床上，里头还有另外五个女病号。病房里有台电视，8点钟大家都在看彩票开奖。埃玛也看了一会儿，但是她觉得非常疲惫，很快就闭上眼睛睡着了，因此她没有听到那周中奖彩票号码的公告……

星期天中午12点，贾森起床弄了点茶喝。然后他打开父亲买的报纸，看到了中奖彩票的号码：5，12，23，24，38，41。他核对了自己的五张彩票。“没中！”他说。

这时，他想起了那个老太太的彩票，也核对了一遍上面的号码：5，12，23，24，38，41。他核对了三遍。六个中奖号码！

“我中奖了！”他说。他亲了亲那张彩票。然后他冲进客厅，亲了亲他的母亲。

“啊，怎么了，贾森？”莉莉·威廉斯问。贾森有时会打她，但他通常不会亲她。她的烟从嘴里掉了下来。

“彩票！我是这周的大奖得主，妈妈！瞧——六个中奖号码。我发财了！”

贾森的父亲来到客厅。“吵什么呢？”他问。

“乔，乔！”莉莉说，“贾森的彩票中了六个号码，我们发财了！”

“不对！”贾森说。“是我 发财了。”

他的父母同时开始说话，但是贾森没有听。他走到街上的电话亭里，打了个非常重要的电话。

星期一早晨，一名警察拿着埃玛的新鞋来到医院。

“一个小女孩在街上发现了这双鞋，送到了警察局。”他说。

“她真好！”埃玛说。

“我们还找到了你的包。”警察说，“不过包已经给掏空了，卡特太太。很抱歉。”

“没关系。”埃玛说，“能找到包我就很高兴了。这是很久以前我儿子给我的。他住在澳大利亚，不过他每周都给我打电话……现在我还拿回了我的新鞋子。非常感谢。”她突然感到开心些了。

那天晚上，一辆救护车把埃玛送回了家。她泡了杯茶，坐下来看电视新闻。

微笑的新闻播音员出现在埃玛的客厅。

“现在要揭晓本周的彩票大奖得主。中奖号码是：5，12，23，24，38，41。这位就是彩票中奖者——贾森·威廉斯！贾森22岁，现在他是个有钱人了。他得到了阳光彩票公司开出的五百万英镑的支票。这可是一大笔钱啊！对了，贾森，你今晚感觉怎样？”

“棒极了！”

“你打算怎么花这笔钱？”

“哦，我要买一座有50个房间的房子和一辆大豪车。我要去纽约、迈阿密……”

埃玛看着电视里的年轻人。贾森·威廉斯脸上带着灿烂的笑容，但他有脏兮兮的棕色长发、棕色眼睛……埃玛一下子坐直了身子。“这就是那个人！”她想，“我记得他的脸。他打了我，抢走了我的包，还偷了我的彩票——我的 中奖彩票，上面有我的 中奖号码！”

她站起来走到电话旁。“喂——警察吗？”她说。

Jason in trouble

At ten o'clock on Monday night Jason was a very happy man. He was in a big room in a hotel with a lot of people in beautiful clothes. There were television cameras, reporters, people from Sunshine Lotteries... Everybody had a drink in their hands, and a girl went round the room with a bottle of champagne.

'Have some more champagne,' she said to Jason.

Jason's face went very red. He snatched the bottle and took a long drink. The champagne ran down his new blue shirt. He laughed. 'Kiss me,' he said to the girl.

Suddenly the door opened and two men came in.

'Hullo!' said Jason. 'Come in and have some champagne! It's OK – Sunshine Lotteries are paying for it!'

'Hullo!' said Jason. 'Come in and have some champagne!'

But the two men were not interested in champagne. They were policemen. Everybody stopped talking and looked at them.

'Is Jason Williams here?' one of the policemen said. 'That's me,' said Jason. 'What do you want?'

'We'd like to ask you some questions, Mr Williams. At the police station. Come with us, please.'

On Tuesday morning Jason was tired and unhappy. He was in a small room at the police station, and there were two policemen in the room with him. One policeman stood by the door, and watched and listened. The second policeman sat at a table and asked questions, questions, questions – the same questions, again and again.

'Now,' said the policeman. 'Tell me again. Where were you at four o'clock on Saturday afternoon?'

'At home,' said Jason. 'I'm telling you the truth. Ask my mother and father! I didn't steal anything!'

'I'm not interested in your mother and father,' said the policeman. 'I can talk to them later. At the moment I'm interested in you , and your answers to my questions. You were in town on Saturday afternoon. We know that, because a woman saw you.'

'No!' said Jason. 'That's a lie. I was at home all afternoon and evening. I watched football on television.'

'Tell me about the football, then. Who won?'

Jason said nothing. His hands and his face felt hot.

'When did the football finish? Five o'clock? Six o'clock?'

'Yes. No,' said Jason. 'I don't remember.'

The policeman smiled. 'How much money was there in the bag, Jason?'

'There wasn't—' Jason stopped. Careful , he thought. Be careful . 'There wasn't a bag,' he said. 'I told you. I didn't steal the old woman's bag!'

'Old woman? Who said anything about an old woman?'

Now Jason felt cold. 'You did,' he said.

'Oh no, I didn't,' said the policeman. 'I talked about a woman. So how did you know she was an old woman?'

He stood up. 'Jason Williams, on Saturday afternoon you hit Mrs Emma Carter on the head and snatched her bag. You stole her money and her lottery ticket. Her winning lottery ticket – so you stole five million pounds from Mrs Carter. You're in trouble, Williams. Big trouble.'

'You're in trouble, Williams. Big trouble.'

'I want to see my lawyer,' said Jason suddenly. Jason did not know any lawyers. But people on television always said that.

That afternoon a different policeman took Jason to court. The court was in a big grey building in the middle of the town. Jason and the policeman waited in a small room. The policeman did not look at Jason, and he did not say anything. Jason felt very unhappy.

Then a woman came into the room. She was young, with short brown hair and an interesting face. She wore a black skirt and a white shirt, and carried a big black bag.

'Mr Williams?' she said to Jason. 'I'm Sally Cash, and I'm your lawyer.'

The policeman left the room, and Sally Cash sat down and began to ask Jason questions.

Soon a man in a black coat came into the room. 'Are you ready to go into court, Miss Cash?' he asked.

'Nearly ready, John,' said the lawyer. She looked at Jason. 'I'm going to do all the talking in court. OK? I don't want you to say anything. Nothing important is going to happen today. They're going to send you to the Crown Court. That's a more important court.'

'When?' asked Jason.

'Soon.'

'Can I go home tonight?' asked Jason. 'Last night I slept in a cell at the police station. It wasn't very nice.'

'No, I'm sorry,' said Miss Cash. 'You can't go home. You see, you're a rich man now. You can buy a ticket to New York, Hong Kong – you can buy an aeroplane! The police want you to stay in this country.'

'But I want to go home!'

'I can ask the court,' said Sally Cash.

Two men and a woman sat at the end of a long table and listened carefully to everyone's story.

Then the woman looked at Sally Cash. 'This case must go to the Crown Court,' she said. 'Jason Williams must stay at the police station and—'

'Excuse me,' said Sally Cash. 'Mr Williams slept in a police cell last night. He's very young and he was unhappy and afraid. He'd like to go home tonight – please.'

The woman talked quietly to the two men for a minute. Then she said, 'Mr Williams, you can go home tonight. But you must leave your lottery cheque here in court.'

'Why?' asked Jason.

'We don't want you to run away, Mr Williams. Now listen carefully. You must live at your parents' house. Don't leave the town. And every morning at ten o'clock you must go to the police station. Do you understand?'

'Yes,' said Jason.

贾森惹麻烦

星期一晚上10点，贾森非常开心。他在一家酒店的一个大房间里，身边有许多衣着光鲜的人。那儿有电视摄像机、记者、阳光彩票公司的人……大家手里都端着饮料，一个女孩端着一瓶香槟酒，在房间里穿梭。

“再来点香槟吧。”她对贾森说。

贾森的脸已变得很红了。他抓起酒瓶，喝了好大一口。香槟顺着他新的蓝衬衣流淌下来。他大笑起来。“亲亲我。”他对女孩说。

突然，门开了，两个男人走了进来。

“喂！”贾森说，“进来喝点香槟！没关系的——阳光彩票公司请客！”

但那两个男人对香槟不感兴趣。他们是警察。大家都不再说话，看着他们。

“贾森·威廉斯在吗？”其中一个警察问。

“我就是。”贾森说，“你们想干什么？”

“我们想问你一些问题，威廉斯先生。在警察局问。跟我们走，请吧。”

星期二早晨，贾森疲惫不堪，心情很坏。他呆在警察局的一个小房间里，里面还有两个警察。一个站在门口，边看边听。另一个警察坐在桌旁，提问，提问，再提问——同样的问题，问了一遍又一遍。

“嘿，”警察说，“再跟我说一遍。周六下午4点你在哪儿？”

“在家。”贾森说，“我说的是真的。问问我爸妈！我什么都没偷！”

“我对你爸妈没兴趣。”警察说，“我之后会跟他们谈话的。现在我感兴趣的只是你 ，还有你对我的问题的回答。周六下午你在城里。我们知道这事儿，因为一个女人看到你了。”

“不！”贾森说。“她撒谎。下午和晚上我一直都在家。我在看电视上的足球比赛。”

“那么，跟我说说那场球赛。谁赢了？”

贾森没说话。他感到手和脸发烫了。

“球赛什么时候结束的？5点？6点？”

“是的。不，”贾森说，“我不记得了。”

警察笑了：“包里有多少钱，贾森？”

“没有——”贾森突然停住了。小心 ，他想，要小心 。“没有包。”他继续说，“我告诉过你，我没有偷那个老女人的包！”

“老女人？这里有谁提到过老女人吗？”

这时贾森感到身上发冷。“你提到过。”他说。

“哦不，我没有。”警察说，“我说过有个女人。可你怎么知道她是个老 女人？”

他站了起来：“贾森·威廉斯，星期六下午你打了埃玛·卡特太太的头，抢了她的包。你偷了她的钱和她的彩票。她的中奖 彩票——所以你偷了卡特太太的五百万英镑。你惹麻烦了，威廉斯。大麻烦。”

“我要见我的律师。”贾森突然说。贾森不认识任何律师。不过在电视里人们总是这么说。

那天下午，另一名警察把贾森带到法庭。法庭位于市中心的一幢灰色大楼里。贾森和警察在一个小房间里等着。警察没有看贾森，他什么都没说。贾森觉得很不高兴。

然后一个女人走进房间。她很年轻，有一头棕色短发，长着一张有趣的脸。她穿着黑裙子和白衬衫，拿着一个大黑包。

“威廉斯先生？”她对贾森说，“我是萨莉·卡什，是你的律师。”

警察离开了房间，萨莉·卡什坐下来，开始问贾森问题。

不久，一个身着黑色外套的男人走进房间。“你准备好上法庭了吗，卡什小姐？”他问。

“差不多好了，约翰。”律师说。她把目光转向贾森：“法庭上所有的话都由我来说，好吗？我不想让你说什么话。今天不会有什么重要的事。他们会把你送到刑事法庭，那是个高一级的法庭。”

“什么时候？”贾森问。

“很快。”

“我今晚可以回家吗？”贾森问道，“昨天晚上我睡在警察局的小牢房里。那儿可不怎么样。”

“不行，很抱歉。”卡什小姐说，“你不能回家。你看，现在你是个有钱人了。你可以买票去纽约、香港——你连飞机也可以买！警察要你呆在本国。”

“但是我想回家！”

“我可以问问法庭。”萨莉·卡什说。

两个男人和一个女人坐在一张长桌的一端，认真地听着每个人的陈述。

然后那个女人看着萨莉·卡什。“这件案子必须交由刑事法庭处理。”她说，“贾森·威廉斯必须呆在警察局，而且——”

“对不起，打扰一下。”萨莉·卡什说，“威廉斯先生昨晚睡在警察局的小牢房里。他很年轻，他很不高兴，而且还害怕。他今晚想回家——请准许。”

那个女人轻声地和那两个男人交谈了一会儿。然后她说：“威廉斯先生，今晚你可以回家，但你必须把彩票支票留在这里，留在法庭。”

“为什么？”贾森问。

“我们不想你逃跑，威廉斯先生。现在仔细听好：你必须住在你父母家，不得离开这个城市，每天上午10点必须去警察局报到。你明白了吗？”

“明白。”贾森说。

Everybody loves a winner

When Jason got home, his mother was very excited. 'We saw you on the news last night,' she said. 'With your cheque for five million pounds. You're rich and famous!'

'I'm in trouble, Mum,' said Jason. 'Please phone the police. Say, "My son was at home on Saturday afternoon. He watched the football on television." Please.'

'I can't say that,' said his mother. 'It isn't true.'

'Would you like ten thousand pounds?' asked Jason suddenly.

'No,' said Lily Williams. 'I always tell the truth.'

'Twenty thousand,' said Jason.

'Why do you want me to tell a lie to the police?' asked Lily. 'What did you do on Saturday afternoon?' She looked at Jason. 'You did something bad. Is that it? And now you want me to tell a lie for you. But I don't tell lies.'

'Thirty thousand!' said Jason. 'Please, Mum! Help me! I slept in a police cell last night, and I was in court this afternoon. Now they're going to send me to the Crown Court. Mum – thirty thousand pounds! Think about it.'

'OK, son,' said Lily Williams slowly. 'For thirty thousand pounds. I think I can tell a lie. But what did you do on Saturday afternoon? Tell me.'

'For thirty thousand pounds, I think I can tell a lie,' said Lily.

'Nothing,' said Jason. 'I didn't do anything.'

'So why are they sending you to the Crown Court?'

Jason didn't answer, and his mother looked at him. 'And what about your Dad? He was at home on Saturday afternoon. You weren't, and he knows that. What do you want him to say to the police?'

'OK, OK,' said Jason. 'Dad can have thirty thousand pounds too. But not today. My lottery cheque is at the court, and I've only got ￡2 in my pocket!'

Jason did not sleep well that night. On Wednesday morning at ten o'clock he went to the police station.

'I'm here,' he said.

'You've got a visitor,' said the policeman. 'It's your wife. She wants to see you.'

Jason's mouth opened. 'My wife?' he said. 'But...'

The policeman opened a door and called, 'He's here, Mrs Williams!'

A young woman came into the room. 'Hullo, Jason.'

Fiona Williams was small and fat. She had long yellow hair and a big red mouth. She looked at Jason, but she talked to the policemen.

'Jason is my husband,' she said. 'Our son was born two years ago. His name's Jack. I loved Jason, but he wasn't very nice to me. Sometimes he hit me. One night he broke two of my teeth. Then the baby was ill and cried a lot. Jason hit him too. Jack was only two months old, and Jason hit him – a little baby!'

'Jason hit him-a little baby!'

'That's a lie!' said Jason. 'I didn't—'

'Oh yes, you did!' Fiona said. She spoke to the policeman again. 'So I left him, and took the baby with me. Jason didn't look for us. He didn't want us, and he never gave me any money for our son. He went home to his mother and father, and he forgot about little Jack and me. I forgot about Jason too. Then I saw him on television, with a cheque from Sunshine Lotteries for five million pounds. Well, I'm his wife, Jack's his son – and we want half of his money!'

'Well, Mr Williams,' said the policeman. 'Is this woman your wife?'

'Don't ask him, ask me!' Fiona said. 'He's my husband, and I can prove it. I'm going to get a good lawyer, and I'm going to get that two and a half million pounds!'

'Everybody wants my money!' said Jason. 'I'm going to see my lawyer!'

So on Wednesday afternoon Jason went to Sally Cash's office. It was in a big building with 'Evans, Robinson, Dennis and Day' over the door.

'Why isn't your name there too?' asked Jason.

'Because I'm young and not very important,' said Sally with a smile. 'I work for Mr Dennis.'

Sally's office was very small. There were books on the table and on all the chairs. Sally moved the books off one chair, and Jason sat down.

'So, Jason,' Sally said, 'you have a wife and son.'

'How do you know that?' said Jason.

'Your wife's lawyer telephoned me this afternoon,' said Sally. 'Your wife wants some of your lottery money. And because she's your wife, and has a two-year-old son, she can get it easily.'

'I'm not going to give her anything,' Jason said. 'She left me. She went away with a new lover, and she took our baby with her. She never wrote or telephoned. I looked for her, but I couldn't find her. I cried every night...'

'Your wife tells a different story. She left you because you hit her, and the baby. Is that true?'

'I don't remember,' Jason said angrily. 'It was a long time ago. She just wants my money. Everybody wants my money! But it was my lottery ticket, so it's my money!'

'Mmm,' said Sally. 'Perhaps it was Mrs Emma Carter's lottery ticket. She remembered the numbers because they were important to her.'

'Huh,' said Jason. 'That old woman just wants my money because she saw me on television. She thought of a good story about the numbers, and now she says that it was her ticket. Did the ticket have her name on it?'

'No. There are no names on lottery tickets.'

'So she can't prove that it was her ticket,' said Jason. 'She can't take my money away from me.'

'Perhaps she can, and perhaps she can't. We don't know. But she's going to need a good lawyer. And lawyers are expensive. It isn't going to be easy for her.'

'So that old woman wants all the money. Fiona wants half of it. My Mum wants thirty thousand pounds, my Dad wants thirty thousand pounds...'

'You're forgetting me,' said Sally.

'I don't understand,' Jason said.

'I told you. Lawyers are expensive. And I'm doing a lot of work for you. You can't pay me now, because your cheque is at the court. But I can wait.'

'Oh, thanks very much,' said Jason. 'Very kind of you.'

Sally smiled. 'Now, let's talk about the bag-snatching.'

'I didn't do it.'

Sally looked tired. 'Jason, I want to help you, but it's very difficult. Mrs Carter saw your face in the street, and then she saw you on television. She's going to stand up in the court and say, "That's the man! He stole my bag, my money, and my lottery ticket."'

'But it isn't true,' said Jason. 'I was at home. I watched the football on television. Ask my Mum!'

'How much money are you giving her, Jason?' Sally asked quietly. 'Thirty thousands pounds, was it?'

Jason's face went red. He wanted to hit Sally. She looked at his red, angry face, and waited. Then she said:

Sally looked at his red, angry face, and waited.

'Jason, in the Crown Court a lot of people are going to look at you. They're going to think, "This is a nasty young man. He hits people – his wife, his baby, old women in the street. He steals things. He wins five million pounds in the lottery, but he doesn't want to give a penny to his wife and son. And he tells lies." They're not going to like you, Jason. And that's not going to help you. So, please , tell the truth. Say that you're sorry. You're young. You can begin again, stay out of trouble. But you must tell the truth to the court.'

Jason thought for a minute. Then he looked at Sally. 'OK,' he said slowly, 'perhaps I took the old woman's bag. But that lottery ticket wasn't in her bag. It's my ticket. I bought it, I paid for it, with my money. OK?'

Sally Cash did not answer. She looked at Jason for two or three long minutes. Then she said slowly, 'OK, Jason. You stole the bag, but it was your lottery ticket.'

人人爱赢家

贾森到家时，他的母亲非常激动。“我们在昨晚的新闻中看到你啦。”她说，“还有你那张五百万英镑的支票。你有钱有名了！”

“我惹麻烦了，妈妈。”贾森说，“求你打电话给警察，说‘星期六下午我儿子呆在家里，他在看电视里的足球赛。’求你了。”

“我不能那么说。”他的母亲说，“那不是真的。”

“你想要一万英镑吗？”贾森突然问。

“不要。”莉莉·威廉斯说，“我从来都说实话。”

“两万英镑。”贾森说。

“你为什么想让我对警察撒谎？”莉莉问。“星期六下午你做什么了？”她看着贾森，“你做坏事了，是不是？现在你想让我帮你撒谎。但我不说谎话。”

“三万英镑！”贾森说。“求你了，妈妈！帮帮我！昨晚我睡在警察局的小牢房里，今天下午我又上了法庭。现在他们要把我送往刑事法庭。妈妈——三万英镑！考虑一下。”

“好吧，儿子。”莉莉·威廉斯慢悠悠地说，“为了三万英镑，我想我可以撒个谎。不过星期六下午你干什么了？告诉我。”

“什么也没干。”贾森说，“我什么也没干。”

“那他们为什么要送你上刑事法庭？”

贾森没有回答，他的母亲看着他：“还有你爸怎么办？星期六下午他在家。你没在家，他是知道的。你想让他 跟警察说什么？”

“好吧，好吧。”贾森说，“爸爸也会得到三万英镑，但不是今天。我的彩票支票在法庭，我现在兜里只有两英镑！”

那天晚上，贾森没睡好。星期三上午10点，他去了警察局。

“我来了。”他说。

“你有位访客。”警察说，“是你老婆。她想见你。”

贾森张大了嘴。“我老婆？”他说，“可是……”

警察打开门喊道：“他在这儿，威廉斯太太！”

一个年轻女人走进房间：“嘿，贾森。”

菲奥娜·威廉斯矮矮胖胖。她有一头黄色长发和一张红色的大嘴。她看了看贾森，却对警察说了起来。

“贾森是我老公。”她说，“我们的儿子两年前出生的。他叫杰克。我爱贾森，可他对我并不好。有时他还打我。有天晚上他打掉了我两颗牙。后来孩子病了，哭得很厉害。贾森也打他。杰克那时只有两个月大，贾森竟然打他——一个小婴儿！”

“撒谎！”贾森说，“我没有——”

“哦，你有！”菲奥娜说。她接着又对警察说：“因此我离开了他，带走了孩子。贾森没有找我们。他不想要我们，从没有为了我们的孩子给我任何钱。他回了他爸妈家，忘了小杰克和我。我也忘了贾森。后来我在电视上看到他，还有阳光彩票公司给的五百万英镑的支票。对了，我是他老婆，杰克是他儿子——他的钱我们想要一半！”

“嗯，威廉斯先生，”警察说，“这个女人是你老婆吗？”

“别问他，问我！”菲奥娜说，“他是我老公，我可以证明。我会找个好律师，我要得到那二百五十万英镑！”

“谁都想要我的钱！”贾森说，“我要见我的律师！”

于是星期三下午贾森去了萨莉·卡什的办公室。办公室在一座大楼里，门上写着“埃文斯、鲁宾逊、丹尼斯和戴”。

“门上怎么没有你的名字？”贾森问。

“因为我很年轻，又不是重要人物。”萨莉笑着说，“我在丹尼斯先生手下工作。”

萨莉的办公室很小。桌上和所有的椅子上都放着书。萨莉拿开一把椅子上的书，贾森坐了下来。

“这么说，贾森，”萨莉说，“你有妻子和儿子。”

“你怎么知道？”贾森说。

“今天下午你妻子的律师给我打电话了。”萨莉说，“你妻子想分一些你的彩票奖金。而且因为她是你的妻子，还带着一个两岁的儿子，她会轻松地拿到这笔钱。”

“我不会给她一分钱。”贾森说，“她离开了我。她跟一个新相好跑了，还带走了我们的孩子。她从没写过信，也没打过电话。我找过她，但是找不到。我每天晚上都会哭……”

“你的妻子可不是这么说的。她离开你是因为你打她和孩子。是真的吗？”

“我不记得了。”贾森生气地说，“那是很久以前的事了。她只是想要我的钱。谁都想要我的钱！但那是我的 彩票，所以是我的 钱！”

“ ，”萨莉说，“也许那是埃玛·卡特太太的彩票。她记得那些号码，因为它们对她很重要。”

“哼，”贾森说，“那个老女人只不过想要我的钱，因为她在电视上看到了我。她给那些号码编了个很妙的故事，于是就说那是她的彩票。彩票上有她的名字吗？”

“没有。彩票上没有名字。”

“所以她不能证明 那是她的彩票。”贾森说，“她不能从我这儿把钱拿走。”

“也许她能，也许她不能，我们不知道。但她会需要一个好律师，而请律师是很费钱的。这对她来说可不容易。”

“所以那个老女人想要所有的 钱。菲奥娜想要一半 。我妈要三万英镑，我爸要三万英镑……”

“你忘记我了。”萨莉说。

“我不明白。”贾森说。

“我告诉过你，请律师很费钱。而我正在为你做很多事。你现在无法付我钱，因为你的支票在法庭。不过我可以等。”

“哦，非常感谢。”贾森说，“你真好。”

萨莉笑了：“现在，咱们来说说抢包的事吧。”

“我没干过。”

萨莉看起来有些厌烦：“贾森，我想帮你，但这很难。卡特太太在街上看见了你的脸，后来她又在电视上看到你。她会站在法庭上说，‘就是这个人！他偷了我的包、我的钱，还有我的彩票。’”

“可这不是真的。”贾森说，“当时我在家里。我在看电视上的足球赛。可以问我妈！”

“你打算给她多少钱，贾森？”萨莉轻声地问，“三万英镑，对吧？”

贾森的脸红了，他想打萨莉。萨莉看着他那张通红的、愤怒的脸，等了一会儿。然后她说：

“贾森，在刑事法庭上会有很多人看着你。他们会想，‘这是个龌龊的年轻人。他打人——他的妻子，他的孩子，街上的老太太。他偷东西。他中了五百万英镑彩票，可他一分钱都不给妻子和孩子。而且他还撒谎。’他们是不会喜欢你的，贾森。而这对你没有好处。所以，请 说实话。说你很抱歉。你很年轻，你可以从头开始，远离麻烦。但你必须 在法庭上说实话。”

贾森想了一会儿，然后他看着萨莉。“好吧。”他缓缓说道，“可能我拿了那个老女人的包，但那张彩票不 在她的包里。那是我的 彩票。我 买的，我 付的钱，用我的 钱。行吗？”

萨莉·卡什没有回答。她看着贾森，看了足有两三分钟。然后她慢慢地说：“好吧，贾森。你偷了包，但彩票是你的。”

Emma gets a lawyer

On Wednesday evening Simon Carter telephoned his mother. He lived near Sydney with his wife and their two children, and he telephoned Emma every week. She told him the story of her lottery ticket. Simon listened carefully, and got angrier and angrier.

'Is your head OK now, Mum?'

'Yes, thank you, Simon. But I'm very, very angry. That young man stole my lottery ticket. Now he's got a cheque for five million pounds – and I've got nothing! I don't want to be rich, but I do want to come to Australia and visit you, and Mollie, and my grandchildren. It's not right, Simon! I had the winning ticket, I paid for it, and that man stole it!' She began to cry.

'Mum, listen,' said Simon. 'Go and see a lawyer.'

'I don't know any lawyers,' said Emma unhappily.

'Look in the telephone book,' said Simon. 'There are lawyers in every town.'

'But lawyers are expensive. I can't pay a lawyer.'

'I can pay a lawyer,' said Simon. 'I'm sending you some money today, through my bank. Don't cry, Mum. Put on your best dress and go and see a lawyer.'

'Simon, you're a wonderful son.'

'And you're a wonderful mother. Goodbye, Mum. And good luck!'

'Well, Mrs Carter, how can I help you?'

It was Thursday morning and Emma was in Edwin Jones's office. Edwin Jones was a big man, with a red face and small blue eyes.

'It's about a lottery ticket,' Emma began.

'Ah, the lottery. Everybody wants to win the lottery!'

'But I did !' said Emma. 'It was my ticket – my numbers.'

'Tell me about it, Mrs Carter. From the beginning.'

So Emma told the lawyer everything, and he listened carefully. When Emma finished, he said:

'Those numbers on the ticket – tell them to me again.'

Emma told the lawyer everything.

'5, 12, 23, 24, 38, 41.'

'And you always get a ticket with those numbers. Why, Mrs Carter?' asked the lawyer.

'All those numbers are important to me. I was born on 5th December, 1923. I lived at number 24 Sandwich Road for 38 years. And my son Simon is 41 years old.'

'I see. Well, Mrs Carter,' Mr Jones said. 'What do you want me to do?'

'Please talk to Sunshine Lotteries, Mr Jones. They've got my ticket.'

'But, Mrs Carter, what can they do? All lottery tickets look the same. People don't write their names on their tickets... Perhaps it is your ticket, but we can't prove it.'

'But we can! My ticket's different! Please listen! I always put a little kiss on my ticket... you know, an X.'

'Why do you do that?'

'My son lives in Australia with his family. I'd like to visit them, but aeroplane tickets are very expensive. So every week I get a lottery ticket and I think about Simon and his wife and my grandchildren, and I send them a kiss. Simon's a wonderful son. He telephones me every week. He never forgets...'

The lawyer smiled. 'Yes, yes, I understand,' he said. 'My mother lives in Wales, and I telephone her every week too. Please go home now, Mrs Carter. I'm going to make some telephone calls. Come and see me again tomorrow.'

埃玛找律师

星期三傍晚，西蒙·卡特给他的母亲埃玛打了电话。他和妻子以及两个孩子住在悉尼附近，他每周都给埃玛打电话。埃玛给他讲了彩票的事情。西蒙认真地听着，越听越生气。

“现在你的头好了吗，妈妈？”

“好了，谢谢你，西蒙。可我非常非常生气。那个年轻人偷了我的彩票。现在他得到了一张五百万英镑的支票，而我什么都没得到！我不想发财，但我确实 想去澳大利亚看看你和莫莉，还有我的孙子们。这不对头，西蒙！我拥有那张中奖彩票，我掏钱买的它，而那个人偷了它！”她哭了起来。

“妈妈，听着，”西蒙说，“去找个律师。”

“我一个律师都不认识。”埃玛难过地说。

“在电话簿里找找。”西蒙说，“每个城市里都有律师。”

“但请律师要花很多钱。我请不起。”

“我 可以付律师费。”西蒙说，“我今天就从银行给你汇些钱。别哭，妈妈。穿上你最好的衣服，去见个律师吧。”

“西蒙，你真是个很棒的儿子。”

“你也是个很棒的妈妈。再见，妈妈。祝你好运！”

“哦，卡特太太，有什么可以帮你的吗？”

星期四早晨，埃玛来到埃德温·琼斯的办公室。埃德温·琼斯是个大块头男人，脸红彤彤的，有一双蓝色小眼睛。

“一张彩票的事儿。”埃玛开口道。

“啊，彩票。大家都想中彩票！”

“但我中 了！”埃玛说，“那是我的 彩票——我的 号码。”

“跟我说说这事儿，卡特太太。从头说起。”

于是，埃玛把所有的事都告诉了律师，他听得很认真。埃玛说完后，他说：

“彩票上的号码——再跟我说一次。”

“5，12，23，24，38，41。”

“你买彩票总是选这些号码，那是为什么，卡特太太？”律师问。

“所有这些数字对我来说都很重要。我的生日是1923年12月5日。我在桑威奇路24号住了38年。我儿子西蒙41岁。”

“我明白了。那么，卡特太太，”琼斯说，“你想让我做什么？”

“请和阳光彩票公司谈谈，琼斯先生。他们拿着我的彩票。”

“但是，卡特太太，他们能做什么？所有的彩票看上去都一样。人们又不在彩票上写自己的名字……或许那是 你的彩票，可我们无法证明 这一点。”

“但我们可以！我的彩票和其他的不一样！请听我说！我总是在我的彩票上画一个小小的亲吻符号……你知道的，一个X。”

“你为什么这样做？”

“我儿子和他的家人住在澳大利亚。我想去探望他们，但机票很贵。所以每周我都买一张彩票，我挂念西蒙、他的妻子和我的孙子们，所以我送给他们一个吻。西蒙是个很棒的儿子。他每周都给我打电话。他从来不会忘记……”

律师笑了。“是的，是的，我理解。”他说，“我母亲住在威尔士，我每周也给她打电话。现在请回家吧，卡特太太。我要打几个电话。明天再来见我吧。”

The money and the ticket

Jason did not sleep on Wednesday night. On Thursday morning he got up very early, and made some tea.

'What am I going to do?' he thought. 'They're going to send me to prison because I stole that old woman's bag. But I'm going to say sorry – sorry to the court, sorry to the old woman, sorry to everybody. Then perhaps I can get out of prison after – what did my lawyer say? – only eighteen months. OK. So I go to prison... but I don't want to lose that five million pounds! I want the court to believe it was my ticket.'

'So I go to prison...'

He drank his tea, and remembered his meeting with Sally Cash. They're not going to like you, Jason. They're going to think, 'This is a nasty young man. '

'OK,' Jason thought. 'I'm going to do something nice. What can I do? Yes, I know! Give some of the money away! I can give it to that charity, "Help the children". They send doctors and nurses to Africa and India. I saw them on television last Christmas. They always need money. Wonderful! People can't say I'm nasty after that!'

'Help the Children' had a charity shop in the middle of the town, and at nine o'clock Jason was outside the door. There were two women in the shop.

'Good morning,' said the older woman. 'Can we help you? Are you looking for some cheap clothes?'

'No,' said Jason. 'I want to give you some money.'

'That's nice of you,' said the younger woman.

'Yes,' Jason said. 'I want to give five hundred thousand pounds to "Help the Children".'

'Five hundred pounds?' said the older woman. 'That's wonderful!'

'No, no,' said Jason. 'Not five hundred pounds. Five hundred thousand pounds!'

The younger woman looked at him. 'Have you got five hundred thousand pounds?'

'Of course I have!' said Jason. 'Well, I haven't got the money now. It's at the court. But I want you to have it.'

The older woman looked at the younger woman, and then at Jason. 'You haven't got any money. Go away.'

'Yes, I have! I won the lottery!' said Jason. 'OK. Listen. Let's say a million pounds. How about that? One million pounds for "Help the Children"!'

The younger woman opened the door, and the older woman said, 'Go away! We don't want you here.'

'Go away! We don't want you here,' she said.

On Thursday afternoon, Edwin Jones was in the office of Sunshine Lotteries with Mr David Ray. He told Mr Ray the story of Emma Carter and her winning numbers.

'Look, Mr Jones,' said Mr Ray. 'Mr Williams had the winning ticket, so we gave him a cheque for the money. I'm sorry, but I can't help you, or Mrs Carter.'

'But it wasn't Williams's ticket. It was Mrs Carter's.'

'You can't prove that, Mr Jones. All lottery tickets look the same. They don't have names on them.'

'I can prove it,' said Edwin Jones. 'Listen. Mrs Carter's ticket is different. You see, she always gets the same numbers. And every week she puts an X on her ticket.'

He told Mr Ray about Mrs Carter's son in Australia. Then he took a lottery ticket out of his pocket. 'This is an old ticket. Look – Mrs Carter always puts an X, here ...Please go and look at the winning ticket. Now!'

Mr Ray went away and came back five minutes later. His face was unhappy.

'Well?' said Edwin Jones.

'I don't know,' Mr Ray said. 'All the tickets go through the computer many times, so it's difficult to see—'

'Mr Ray, is there an X on that ticket, or isn't there?'

Mr Ray looked angrily at Edwin Jones. 'Perhaps there is, and perhaps there isn't,' he said. 'But what does an X prove? Perhaps hundreds of people write an X on their lottery ticket. Perhaps it's Mrs Carter's X, but how do we know? Tell me that, Mr Jones.'

'I can't tell you, but the police can. Now, Mr Ray, please call your bank and stop that cheque. Next, give that lottery ticket to the police. They're going to want it.'

Mr Ray looked unhappy. 'Yes, all right,' he said.

'Then you need a lawyer,' said Mr Jones. 'Because Mrs Carter wants her money – and she wants it now!'

On Thursday afternoon, Jason Williams went to Sally Cash's office and told her about 'Help the Children' and the women in the shop. Sally looked tired.

'Jason, Jason!' she said. 'What is all this? I don't want to listen to more lies.'

'I'm telling the truth! I went into the "Help the Children" shop, and they didn't believe me. They said, "You haven't got any money. Go away!" Please telephone them, Miss Cash. I want to give them one million pounds. Please tell them that.'

'But...' said Sally Cash. 'But your lottery cheque is at the court...'

'Yes, I know. But when I get the money, I want to give one million pounds to "Help the Children". I thought about it very carefully. I won all this money in the lottery, and I want to do something good with it. All those little children in Africa and India – I want to help them.'

'All those little children in Africa and India –I want to help them.'

Sally looked at him for a minute.

'Please,' said Jason. 'Please help me. You wanted to help me. You told me that.'

'OK,' Sally said suddenly. 'I believe you. You want to give away a million pounds.' She thought for a second. 'Write a letter to "Help the Children". Write it here, now. Tell them about the million pounds, and put your name on the letter. I'm going to put my name on the letter too, and take the letter to the charity's office now. OK?'

奖金和彩票

星期三晚上，贾森一夜未眠。星期四早晨他很早就起了床，还泡了茶。

“我该怎么办？”他想，“他们会把我送进监狱，因为我偷了那个老太太的包。不过我会说对不起——对不起法庭，对不起那个老太太，对不起所有人。然后大概我可以出狱，在——我的律师怎么说来着？——仅仅18个月以后。好吧。那么我去坐牢……可我不想失去那五百万英镑！我要让法庭相信那是我的 彩票。”

他喝了口茶，随后想起了和萨莉·卡什的会面。他们不会喜欢你的，贾森。他们会想，“这是个龌龊的年轻人。”

“好吧，”贾森想，“那我就去做些好事。我能做什么呢？对，我知道了！捐些钱出去！我可以把钱捐给那个慈善组织——‘儿童救助会’。他们派医生和护士去非洲和印度。去年圣诞节我在电视上看到过。他们总是需要钱。太棒了！这样做后人们就不会说我龌龊了！”

“儿童救助会”在市中心有家慈善商店，9点时贾森已经到了店门外。店里有两个女人。

“早上好。”年长的女人说，“需要我们帮忙吗？你是要找一些便宜的衣服吗？”

“不是。”贾森说，“我想给你们捐些钱。”

“你真好。”年轻的女人说。

“是这样，”贾森说，“我想把五十万英镑捐给‘儿童救助会’。”

“五百英镑？”年长的女人说，“那太好了！”

“不，不对。”贾森说，“不是五百 英镑。是五十万 英镑！”

年轻的女人看着他：“你有 五十万英镑吗？”

“我当然有！”贾森说，“嗯，我现在还没拿到钱。钱在法庭。但我想让你们得到它。”

年长的女人看了看年轻的女人，又看了看贾森：“你根本就没钱。走开。”

“不，我有！我中了彩票！”贾森说，“好，听着。我捐一百万英镑。怎么样？捐一百万英镑给‘儿童救助会’！”

年轻的女人打开门，年长的女人说：“走开！这里不欢迎你。”

星期四下午，埃德温·琼斯和戴维·雷先生在阳光彩票公司的办公室。琼斯把埃玛·卡特的事情以及她的中奖号码告诉了雷先生。

“是这样，琼斯先生，”雷先生说，“威廉斯先生持有中奖彩票，所以我们开给了他那笔钱的支票。对不起，我帮不了你，也帮不了卡特太太。”

“可那不是威廉斯的彩票，是卡特太太的。”

“你无法证明这一点，琼斯先生。所有的彩票看上去都一样。彩票上面没有名字。”

“我能 证明。”埃德温·琼斯说，“听着，卡特太太的彩票是不一样的。你看，她总是买相同的号码，而且她每周都会在彩票上画个X。”

他向雷先生讲了卡特太太的儿子在澳大利亚一事。然后他从兜里掏出一张彩票：“这是张旧彩票。瞧——卡特太太总是画个X，这儿 ……请去看看那张中奖彩票，现在就去！”

雷先生走开了，五分钟后他回来了。他的脸色不太好。

“怎么样？”埃德温·琼斯问。

“我不知道。”雷先生说，“所有的彩票都进出电脑很多次，所以很难看到——”

“雷先生，彩票上是有个X还是没有？”

雷先生怒气冲冲地看着埃德温·琼斯。“或许有，或许没有。”他说，“但是一个X能够证明什么？没准有好几百人都在他们的彩票上画个X。那可能是卡特太太的X，但我们怎么知道？告诉我，琼斯先生。”

“我无法告诉你，但警察可以。现在，雷先生，请给你们的银行打电话，冻结那张支票。然后，把那张彩票交给警察。他们会需要的。”

雷先生看起来很不高兴。“噢，好吧。”他说。

“然后你们还需要一个律师。”琼斯先生说，“因为卡特太太想要她的钱——而且她马上就要！”

星期四下午，贾森·威廉斯去了萨莉·卡什的办公室，把“儿童救助会”和慈善商店里女人的事情告诉了她。萨莉面露厌烦之色。

“贾森，贾森！”她说，“这都是 些什么事？我不想再听谎话了。”

“我说的是真的！我去了‘儿童救助会’的商店，可她们不相信我。她们说，‘你根本就没钱。走开！’请给她们打个电话，卡什小姐。我想给她们一百万英镑。请将这事告诉她们。”

“但是……”萨莉·卡什说，“但是你的彩票支票在法庭……”

“对，我知道。不过拿到钱后，我想捐一百万英镑给‘儿童救助会’。这件事我很认真地想过了。我的钱都是中彩票得的，我想用它做点好事。那些非洲和印度的小孩子——我想帮助他们。”

萨莉看了他一会儿。

“求你了。”贾森说，“请帮帮我。你想要帮我的。你跟我说过的。”

“好吧。”萨莉突然说，“我相信你。你想捐一百万英镑。”她想了片刻。“给‘儿童救助会’写封信。在这儿写，就现在。告诉她们你要捐一百万英镑的事，再在信上写下你的名字。我也会把我的名字写在信上，然后马上把信送到这家慈善组织的办公室。好吗？”

So who's going to win?

On Thursday evening Sally Cash went home. When she arrived, her husband Colin was in the living-room. 'Hi,' Colin said. 'Did you have a good day?'

'Not bad,' Sally said. 'I'm working on a very interesting case. It's going to be on the news tonight, I think. Let's put the television on.'

After about ten minutes, the newsreader said:

'And now for some news about Sunshine Lotteries. The winner of last Saturday's lottery was Jason Williams. He had the winning ticket, and Sunshine Lotteries gave him a cheque for five million pounds. Now Mr Williams wants to give one million pounds to the charity "Help the Children".

But is it Mr Williams's money? Mrs Emma Carter says that it isn't. This is Mrs Carter's story. In the town last Saturday afternoon a young man hit her on the head and snatched her bag. And in that bag was a lottery ticket – the ticket with the winning numbers. Mrs Carter remembers the numbers very well, she says. So is it Jason Williams's ticket, or Mrs Carter's ticket? Who's going to get the money? We have a lawyer with us here, so let's ask him that question.'

The lawyer talked very interestingly.

'Who's that?' asked Colin.

'That's old Sam Green,' said Sally. 'He's a good lawyer. He's working for Sunshine Lotteries, I think.'

'And who are you working for, Sally?'

'Jason Williams.'

'And he snatched this woman's bag, yes?' said Colin. 'Is he going to go to prison, do you think?'

'Perhaps,' Sally said. 'But when he comes out, he's going to have five million pounds – or four million pounds.'

'But it's Emma Carter's money!' Colin said. 'It was her ticket, in her bag. Of course it was!'

'Well, she says it was,' said Sally. 'But how do we know? She's an old woman. Old people forget things easily. Perhaps she thought about her lottery numbers, but forgot to buy a ticket that day.'

'So the bag-snatcher wins, eh?' said Colin. He looked at Sally. 'He hits an old woman on the head, and wins five million pounds. Wonderful!'

'I know,' Sally said. 'It's difficult to like Jason Williams, it's true. He has a wife and child, but his wife left him because he hit her and the baby. But we must be careful. Perhaps he is telling the truth about the lottery ticket.'

'Never!' said Colin. 'When the case comes to court, they're going to believe Mrs Carter, not Jason Williams. He's nasty!'

'When the case comes to court, they're going to believe Mrs Carter, not Jason Williams.'

'No, he isn't. He wants to give one million pounds to "Help the Children". People are going to like that. What a nice young man!'

Colin laughed. 'Lawyers!' he said. 'So who's going to win, Sally?' he asked.

'The lawyers, of course. Five million pounds is a lot of money, and we're going to have a wonderful time. There's a lot of us, you see. There's Mrs Carter's lawyer, Jason's wife's lawyer, the lawyer for "Help the Children", the lawyer for Sunshine Lotteries – and me, Jason's lawyer. We're going to talk about it in court for days and days. And lawyers are expensive. When we finish, a lot of that five million pounds is going to be our money!'

Sally smiled, happily. 'Colin, shall we get a new car? A Mercedes, perhaps?'

谁会是赢家？

星期四傍晚，萨莉·卡什回了家。她到家时，丈夫科林在客厅里。

“嗨，”科林说，“今天过得好吗？”

“还不错。”萨莉说，“我正在处理一个非常有意思的案子。我想今晚会上电视新闻，咱们打开电视吧。”

大约10分钟后，新闻播音员说道：

现在播报和阳光彩票公司有关的新闻。上周六的彩票得主是贾森·威廉斯。他持有中奖彩票，因此阳光彩票公司给了他一张五百万英镑的支票。现在威廉斯先生想要捐出一百万英镑给慈善组织‘儿童救助会’。

不过，这是威廉斯先生的钱吗？埃玛·卡特太太说不是。下面是卡特太太的说法。上周六下午在城里，一个年轻人打了她的头，抢走了她的包。包里有一张彩票——有中奖号码的彩票。卡特太太说，她对那些号码记得很清楚，她说。那么，这是贾森·威廉斯的彩票，还是卡特太太的彩票？谁将得到那笔钱？我们这里请来了一位律师，让我们来问问他这个问题。”

律师说得很吸引人。

“那是谁？”科林问。

“那是老萨姆·格林。”萨莉说，“他是个好律师，是阳光彩票公司的律师，我想。”

“那你是谁的律师，萨莉？”

“贾森·威廉斯。”

“他抢了那个女人的包，对吗？”科林说，“他会进监狱吗，你觉得呢？”

“可能会吧。”萨莉说，“但是当他出狱后，他会拥有五百万英镑——或者四百万英镑。”

“但那是埃玛·卡特的钱！”科林说，“那是她的 彩票，在她的包里。准是这么回事！”

“嗯，她说 是这样的。”萨莉说，“但我们怎么知道？她是个老太太，老人容易忘事。或许她想着她的彩票号码，但那天却忘了买彩票。”

“所以抢包的歹徒赢了，嗯？”科林说。他看着萨莉：“他打了老太太的头，还中了五百万英镑。真了不起啊！”

“我知道。”萨莉说，“要想喜欢贾森·威廉斯很难，这不假。他有老婆和孩子，可他的老婆离开了他，因为他打她和孩子。但我们必须小心。没准彩票的事他说的是 实话。”

“不可能！”科林说，“案子移交法庭后，大家会相信卡特太太，而不是贾森·威廉斯。他很龌龊！”

“不，他不龌龊。他想捐一百万英镑给‘儿童救助会’。人们会喜欢这件事。多好的年轻人啊！”

科林笑了。“律师啊！”他说，“那么谁会是赢家，萨莉？”他问。

“当然是律师啦。五百万英镑是很大一笔钱，而我们会过得很不错。案件中有很多律师，你瞧，有卡特太太的律师、贾森老婆的律师、‘儿童救助会’的律师、阳光彩票公司的律师——还有我，贾森的律师。我们将在法庭上成天地讨论下去，而律师费是很高的。我们结案时，那五百万英镑中的一大部分都会成为我们的 钱！”

萨莉笑了，笑得很开心：“科林，我们要买辆新车吗？一辆梅赛德斯，怎么样？”

内容简介


夏日里，在一个英国的度假小镇上。一具年轻女子的尸体躺在沙滩上。谁杀了她？是那晚在迪斯科舞厅遇见她并和她跳舞的那两个年轻人西蒙和丹吗？他们有时会偷车，可他们是杀人犯吗？

那晚在迪斯科舞厅到底发生了什么？有目击者说当时有人打架。玛丽走的时候是谁跟着她？她是一个人吗？那玛丽的男朋友吉姆呢？他真的爱她吗？或许他有点儿嫉妒和生气……

法庭需要找到所有这些问题的答案，因为谋杀是重罪，杀人犯往往要被终身监禁。





THE MURDER OF MARY JONES


It is summer time in an English holiday town. A young girl lies dead on the beach. Who killed her? Was it Simon and Dan, the two young men who met her, and danced with her, at the disco that night? They sometimes steal cars, but are they guilty of murder?

What really happened that night at the disco? There are witnesses who say that there was a fight. Who followed Mary when she left? Was she alone? And what about Mary's boyfriend, Jim? Did he really love her? Perhaps he was a little jealous, and angry...

The court needs to find answers to all these questions, because murder is a very serious crime, and murderers are often sent to prison for life.





The Murder of Mary Jones


INTRODUCTION

This is a court in England. The people in the court are trying to answer a question - did Simon Clark and Dan Smith kill Mary Jones, or not? It is a very important question, because in Britain, murderers usually go to prison for life. You can see a picture of the court here . Simon and Dan are there, with two policemen, the judge, the clerk of the court, two lawyers, and the twelve people in the jury. Witnesses come to the witness box, and the lawyers and the judge ask them questions. The jury do not say anything, but they listen carefully. At the end, they must answer the question - are Simon and Dan guilty of murder, or not guilty?

There are two possible endings to the play, Scene 4 (Alternative 1) and Scene 4 (Alternative 2). Read and discuss them, and decide which you like best.

The judge walks to his chair, looks at everybody slowly, and then sits down. The people and the lawyers sit down. Simon and Dan, the two policemen, and the clerk are standing up.

Simon Clark, you are here because of the murder of Mary Jones. Did you kill her, or not?

SIMON

No, sir. I didn't.

CLERK

And you, Dan Smith? Did you kill Mary Jones?

DAN

No, sir. I didn't. I'm not guilty!

SIMON

We didn't kill her!

CLERK

All right. Sit down. (They sit. )

MS WILLS

(Standing up ) My lord, I am Helen Wills, the lawyer for the police. David Carter is the lawyer for Simon Clark and Dan Smith.

JUDGE

Very good. Please begin, Ms Wills.

MS WILLS

Thank you, my lord. Members of the jury, look at the photo, please. There is a girl in the photo with a young man. She is Mary Jones, and he is Jim Wilson, Mary's boyfriend. (The jury look at the photo. )

The courtroom.

JUDGE

Ms Wills, I haven't got that photo.

CLERK

Oh, I'm sorry, my lord. Here you are.

He gives the judge a photo.

JUDGE

Thank you. Please go on, Ms Wills.

MS WILLS

On 12 August, Mary was in a disco in Trenton with Jim. At midnight, she started to walk home along the road by the sea, and someone killed her. Now, please look at the second photo.

JUDGE

Excuse me, Ms Wills. (He holds up a photo. ) This photo? The photo of a dead girl?

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord, that's right. I'm sorry, it isn't a very nice photo. But that is Mary Jones, too. There is blood on her head and face.

JUDGE

Yes, I see. Did someone find her there, that night?

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord. Jim Wilson found her body on the beach near the road at about half past twelve. He tried to help her, but he couldn't. Mary Jones was dead.

JUDGE

How did she die, Ms Wills?

MS WILLS

She died because someone hit her four times on the head with a spanner, my lord. Clerk, can I have the spanner, please?

CLERK

Yes, here you are. (He gives her a spanner. )

MS WILLS

Thank you. It was this spanner, members of the jury. Look at it carefully. This spanner has Mary's blood and hair on it. Can you see that?

She shows the spanner to the jury.

JUDGE

Can I see that, please, Ms Wills?

MS WILLS

Yes, of course, my lord. (She gives it to him. )

JUDGE

Thank you. But who hit her with the spanner, Ms Wills? That's the important question, you know. Who killed her?

MS WILLS

Who killed her? It was Simon Clark and Dan Smith, I think.

JUDGE

Why do you think that? Tell the jury, please.

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord. They were in the disco that evening. They went there in a car, a white Ford Fiesta. It wasn't their car - they stole it. They often steal cars.

JUDGE

I see. And how long were they there?

MS WILLS

They were in the disco for two hours. At about ten o'clock, Dan danced with Mary Jones. After that, Simon Clark danced with her.

JUDGE

Excuse me, Ms Wills. Did Jim see this?

'This spanner has Mary's blood and hair on it.'

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord, he did. He was very angry, and he hit Simon. Then he talked to Mary for half an hour, and after that Mary started to walk home alone.

JUDGE

And Jim stayed in the disco?

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord, he did. But Dan and Simon didn't. They went out, ten minutes after Mary. They drove away in the Fiesta.

JUDGE

Yes. But did anyone see them kill her? That's important.

MS WILLS

No, no one saw them kill her. But the police found the tyre marks of a Ford Fiesta near Mary's body. And later, they found Dan and Simon in a white Ford Fiesta in Bilsford.

JUDGE

Where is Bilsford, Ms Wills?

MS WILLS

Ten kilometres from Trenton, my lord. And in the car there was a spanner. This spanner, members of the jury! With Mary's blood and hair on it! (She shows the spanner to the jury. )

JUDGE

I see. That's very important. (He writes. )

MS WILLS

Yes, my lord. These two boys followed Mary from the disco in the white Fiesta. They stopped the car, hit her on the head with this spanner, and drove away.

DAN

(Standing up ) It's not true! We didn't follow her! We didn't go down that road! It's not true!

JUDGE

Be quiet, young man! Sit down! You can talk later!

MS WILLS

I call my first witness, PC Norton.

PC Norton goes to the witness box.

CLERK

(Giving him a book ) Take this book in your right hand and read what it says.

NORTON

I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

MS WILLS

PC Norton, what happened on 12 August?

NORTON

Well, at 12.47 a.m. someone telephoned the police and I went to the road by the beach in Trenton. I found a young woman's body there, and a young man. His name was Jim Wilson.

MS WILLS

I see. Did Jim call the police?

NORTON

Yes, he did. He was Mary's boyfriend, I think. He tried to help her, but she was dead.

MS WILLS

Where was the body?

NORTON

It was on the beach near the road. There were some tyre marks in the sand near the body. A car stopped there, and then went back towards Trenton, I think.

MS WILLS

Thank you. Wait there, please, and answer Mr Carter's questions. (She sits. )

GARTER

(Standing up ) PC Norton, tell me some more about this boyfriend, Jim Wilson. He tried to help the dead girl, you say. Did he have blood on his shirt and trousers?

NORTON

Yes, sir, he did. There was blood on his face and hands and on his shirt and trousers too.

GARTER

Did you ask him about this?

NORTON

Yes, sir. The blood was there because he tried to help her, he said. He sat in my car and started to cry. He loved her, he said.

'He sat in my car and started to cry.'

GARTER

I see. But why was Jim on the beach?

NORTON

He went for a walk after the disco, he said.

GARTER

I see. Thank you very much.

(He sits down. )

JUDGE

PC Norton, one more question. Were there any cuts on Jim's face or hands?

NORTON

I don't know, sir. There was blood on his face and hands, but it was Mary Jones's blood, I think.

JUDGE

Thank you. That's all. The next witness is Dr Seldon, I think. (Dr Seldon comes in, and the clerk gives him the book. )

SELDON

I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

MS WILLS

Dr Seldon, you looked at Mary Jones's body. What did you find?

SELDON

Mary Jones was a young woman of about 18. She died because somebody hit her four times on the head.

MS WILLS

Thank you. You looked at this spanner very carefully, too. Can you tell us about that, please?

SELDON

Yes. I looked at the spanner and I found blood and hair on it. The blood and hair were Mary Jones's.

MS WILLS

Are you sure about that?

SELDON

Yes. They were the same.

MS WILLS

So did somebody kill her with this spanner?

SELDON

Oh yes. I am sure about that.

MS WILLS

Thank you. Wait there, please.

Ms Wills sits down, and Carter gets up.

GARTER

Dr Seldon, I want to ask you about Mary Jones's hands. Was there any blood on them?

SELDON

Yes, sir, a lot of blood. I looked at it very carefully and it was her blood. Perhaps she put her hands on her head when the spanner hit her.

GARTER

But was there blood under her fingernails, too?

A little blood under her fingernails.

SELDON

Yes, a little.

GARTER

Did you look carefully at that blood, too?

SELDON

No, I didn't. There was a lot of blood on her hands and it was all her blood. I am sure about that.

GARTER

Yes, but think carefully, doctor. What did Mary do when the man hit her? Did she try to hit him, too? Perhaps she cut his face with her fingernails. Do girls sometimes do that?

SELDON

Well, yes, sometimes.

GARTER

So perhaps the man's blood was under her fingernails. Did you look for that?

SELDON

There wasn't much blood under her fingernails.

GARTER

But did you look at it, doctor? Did you look carefully at the blood under her fingernails?

SELDON

No. I'm sorry, I didn't.

GARTER

I see. But there was some blood under her fingernails. You're sure about that?

SELDON

Yes, there was a little blood there. Not much.

Carter sits down. Seldon goes out. PC Moran comes in, and takes the book from the clerk.

MORAN

I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

MS WILLS

PC Moran, you looked at the white Ford Fiesta, I think. What did you find?

MORAN

Well, first I put some paper under each tyre, and drove the car over it. The tyres made marks on the paper. Then I took the paper to the beach, and looked at the tyre marks in the sand.

'I put some paper under each tyre, and drove the car over it.'

MS WILLS

Were they different?

MORAN

No, they weren't. The marks on the beach were from Pirelli ZX37 tyres, and the marks on the paper were from Pirelli ZX37 tyres, too.

MS WILLS

Did you find any more things in the car?

MORAN

Yes. There was a lot of sand from the beach.

MS WILLS

I see. That's very interesting. Thank you very much. Wait there, please. (She sits down. )

GARTER

(Standing up ) PC Moran, do all Ford Fiestas have Pirelli ZX37 tyres?

MORAN

No. Ford Fiestas can have lots of different tyres.

GARTER

And what about Volkswagen Polos? Do they sometimes have Pirelli ZX37 tyres, too?

MORAN

Sometimes, yes, sir.

GARTER

I see. So there are lots of cars with these tyres. Some are Ford Fiestas, but some are Volkswagen Polos. Is that true?

MORAN

That's true, yes.

GARTER

So perhaps a Polo made these marks in the sand?

MORAN

Perhaps, yes.

GARTER

Thank you. Now, there was a lot of sand in the car. Was there any blood in the car too, or hair?

MORAN

No, there wasn't.

GARTER

What? No hair or blood? Did you look?

MORAN

Yes, sir, we did. But we didn't find anything.

GARTER

But Ms Wills said, 'These young men killed Mary Jones.' There was blood on Mary's head and face, blood on her dress, blood on her hands. But there was no blood in the car, you say?

MORAN

No, sir, no blood or hair in the car.

GARTER

I see. Thank you, PC Moran. That's very interesting.

(He sits down. )

Moran goes out, and WPC Gray comes in.

GRAY

(Taking the book ) I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

MS WILLS

WPC Gray, you found Simon Clark and Dan Smith in the white Ford Fiesta. What happened?

GRAY

Well, at ten o'clock that night, a woman called Mrs Symes telephoned the police. 'I can't find my car,' she said. It was a white Ford Fiesta, number M346 WXT.

MS WILLS

Did you look for the car?

GRAY

Yes. At two o'clock in the morning, we found it in Bilsford. Simon Clark and Dan Smith were in the car, so we asked them a lot of questions.

'We asked them a lot of questions.'

MS WILLS

What did they say?

GRAY

They stole the car at eight o'clock, they said. Then they went to a disco in Trenton, and stayed there until about midnight.

MS WILLS

And what did you find in the car?

GRAY

A spanner, and a lot of sand. There was sand in the young men's shoes, too.

MS WILLS

What did they say about the spanner?

GRAY

Nothing. They said, 'Spanner? What spanner?'

MS WILLS

Why was there sand in their shoes? Did you ask them?

GRAY

Yes. They went for a walk on the beach, they said.

MS WILLS

Did you see any blood on these young men?

GRAY

Yes, I did. There was blood on Simon Clark's face. He had two small cuts under his left eye.

MS WILLS

Did you ask him about this?

GRAY

Yes. He said, 'A man in a disco hit me. His hand cut me.'

MS WILLS

I see. Thank you very much. Wait there, please.

(She sits down, and Carter stands up. )

GARTER

I have only two questions, WPC Gray. Did you find any blood on the young men's shoes?

GRAY

No, sir. There was a lot of sand, but no blood.

GARTER

Was there any blood on their shirts or trousers? Blood from these cuts on Simon's face, perhaps?

GRAY

No sir, there wasn't. They were very small cuts.

GARTER

Thank you. (He sits down. )

Jim's story

Jim Wilson goes to the witness box.

CLERK

(Giving Jim the book ) Take this book in your right hand and read from it.

JIM

I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

MS WILLS

(Standing up ) Jim, tell me about Mary. Did you know her well?

JIM

Very well. She was my girlfriend. Our families come to Trenton for a holiday at the same time every year.

MS WILLS

I see. Can you tell us about the night of Saturday 12 August, please?

JIM

Well, I went to the disco with Mary at half past eight. We sat at a table and talked to our friends. Then we danced - talked - danced - and then Mary went home.

MS WILLS

What time did she go home?

JIM

At about - midnight, I think. I don't remember.

MS WILLS

Did you see any new people at the disco?

JIM

Yes. Two young men. They danced with Mary.

MS WILLS

Can you see those two young men here now?

JIM

Yes. Those two there. They killed her! (He looks angrily at Simon Clark and Dan Smith. )

DAN

(Standing ) We didn't kill her! That's not true!

JUDGE

Please, Mr Smith. Sit down!

Dan sits down slowly.

MS WILLS

I'm sorry about that. Now Jim, tell me, what did you do when Mary went out of the disco?

JIM

Well, I stayed for fifteen minutes, to talk to some friends. Then I went for a walk, and - I saw her. There was blood on her face. I tried to help her, but I couldn't.

MS WILLS

So what did you do then?

JIM

I ran to phone the police. But it was no good. She was dead - and they killed her!

He looks at Dan and Simon. Ms Wills sits down.

'They killed her!'

GARTER

(Standing up ) Jim, did you love Mary?

JIM

Yes, I think so - she was my girlfriend.

GARTER

Yes, she was your girlfriend. And you loved her - you think. Mary left the disco at midnight, you say. She walked along that dark road by the sea. You didn't go with her. Why?

JIM

Why? I don't know - she wanted to go alone.

GARTER

Why? Was she angry with you?

JIM

I don't know. A little angry, perhaps. It wasn't important.

GARTER

Were you angry with these young men? With Simon and Dan, because they danced with her?

JIM

A little angry, yes.

GARTER

A little angry, you say. Did you see them dance with her?

JIM

I saw Simon dance with her, but not Dan. I went out with some friends. They wanted to see my car.

GARTER

To see your car? Why? Is it very interesting?

JIM

It's a new car - a Volkswagen Polo. I like it very much. My friends wanted to look at it.

GARTER

I see. What happened when you went back in?

JIM

I saw Mary with that boy. (He looks at Simon. )

GARTER

And what did you do then?

JIM

I was angry. I asked him to stop dancing with her.

GARTER

You asked him, you say. Did you hit him, Jim?

JiM

Well, yes. I hit him once. But he hit me first!

SIMON

That's not true! I didn't hit you! You hit me !

JUDGE

Be quiet, Mr Clark! Please!

SIMON

But it's not true, my lord! I didn't hit him!

JUDGE

Perhaps not. But you can speak later. Do you understand?

SIMON

Yes, sir.

GARTER

What did Mary do when you hit Simon, Jim?

JIM

She laughed, I think. Then she sat at a table with me.

GARTER

Why did she laugh, Jim? Did she laugh at Simon, or you?

JIM

She laughed at Simon, because he was afraid of me!

GARTER

Is that true? Or did she laugh at you, Jim? Perhaps she liked Simon, not you!

JIM

Of course she didn't! She was my girl, and she was there with me , not them!

GARTER

But you were angry with Mary, Jim. Why was that? Did she like them more than you, perhaps?

JIM

NO! I wasn't angry with her , I was angry with Simon!

I was angry, so I hit him.

GARTER

Are you sure?

JIM

Yes, of course! I was angry with him because he danced with my girlfriend, and because he killed her. Don't you understand? He killed her ! Of course I'm angry - he killed her !

GARTER

How do you know that, Jim?

JIM

Everyone knows that! He followed her in his car along the road. Then he took that spanner from the car, and he hit her on the head - two, three times! Then she ran on to the beach, crying.

'He hit her on the head.'

GARTER

What happened then, Jim?

JIM

He hit her again! And then she stopped moving, and there was blood everywhere! Lots of blood! And I tried to help her, but I couldn't, she was dead -

Jim is crying. Carter says nothing for a minute.

GARTER

So, Jim, she ran on to the beach, crying, and he hit her again, you say. How do you know that?

JIM

How? I don't remember. The police said that.

GARTER

No, Jim, they didn't say that. (He waits, but Jim says nothing. ) Jim, there was no blood on Simon or Dan, but there was a lot of blood on you . And you were angry with Mary, because she didn't love you. Is that true, Jim?

JIM

No.

GARTER

Simon and Dan weren't on the beach, Jim. They didn't kill her. But you were there. You went out of the disco and followed her. Did you kill her?

JIM

NO! Of course I didn't! What are you saying? They killed her - their car was there, the spanner was in their car! I didn't kill her! She was my girlfriend - I loved her!

GARTER

You loved her, you say. But you didn't walk home with her on that dark night, Jim. Why not?

JIM

But I did! I went after her! And I found her on the beach! She was dead!

GARTER

Did you go in your car? Your new Polo?

JIM

No, I didn't. I walked. I wanted to think.

GARTER

What did you want to think about?

JIM

About me and Mary. I was sorry - I loved her, you know - And I wanted to talk to her, of course. But she was dead! They killed her, she was dead!

GARTER

But there was no blood on them, or in their car, Jim. The blood was on you ! Perhaps you loved Mary, but you killed her too - because you were angry with her!

JIM

No! Of course I didn't! I didn't kill her. I loved her!

GARTER

One more question, Jim. Do you have Pirelli tyres on your Volkswagen Polo?

JIM

What? Er - no. No, I don't. I have Goodyear tyres.

GARTER

All right. I have no more questions. (He sits. ) Jim goes out, and Ms Wills stands up.

MS WILLS

My lord, I have no more witnesses.

JUDGE

Thank you. Mr Carter, have you any witnesses?

GARTER

Yes, my lord. Mrs lucy Symes, please.

Lucy Symes comes into the witness box.

SYMES

(Taking the book ) I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

GARTER

Mrs Symes, do you have a white Ford Fiesta?

SYMES

Yes, sir.

GARTER

What is the car's number?

SYMES

M346 WXT.

GARTER

And what happened to that car on 12 August?

SYMES

Somebody stole it, sir. I telephoned the police, and they found it next day. There was a lot of sand in it.

'I telephoned the police.'

GARTER

I see. Now, Mrs Symes, do you have a spanner in your car, like this spanner on the table?

SYMES

Well, I don't know, sir. You see, I did have a spanner like that in the car last year, but it wasn't very good. So now I have a better one than that.

GARTER

I see. And where is this new spanner now?

SYMES

In the back of my car, sir. It's always there.

GARTER

What about the old spanner? Where is that?

SYMES

Well, I don't know, sir. I didn't want it, you see.

GARTER

Was it in the car on 12 August?

SYMES

I don't know. Perhaps it was, but I'm not sure.

GARTER

Thank you, Mrs Symes. Please wait there.

He sits down, and Ms Wills stands up.

MS WILLS

Mrs Symes, was your old spanner in the car, or not?

SYMES

I'm not sure. I'm sorry, I don't know.

MS WILLS

Well, perhaps you put the spanner in the back of your car, and then you forgot about it.

SYMES

Yes, perhaps I did.

MS WILLS

Yes. (She takes the spanner from the table and gives it to Mrs Symes. ) And is this spanner like your old car spanner?

SYMES

I think so, yes. Yes, it is.

MS WILLS

Thank you. (She sits down. )

Mrs Symes leaves. Janet Nolan comes to the witness box, and takes the book from the clerk.

JANET

I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

GARTER

Miss Nolan, you were in the disco on the night of 12 August. Did you see Mary Jones?

JANET

Yes, I saw her with her boyfriend, Jim. And then later she danced with those two boys.

GARTER

Which two boys?

JANET

Those two. (She looks at Simon and Dan. )

GARTER

I see. Did she dance with them for a long time?

JANET

For about ten minutes, yes. She danced with Dan first and then Simon. Jim wasn't in the disco then. When Jim saw them, he was very angry.

'She danced with Dan first and then Simon.'

GARTER

What did he do?

JANET

He hit Simon.

GARTER

And what did Simon do?

JANET

Nothing. He didn't hit Jim. He walked away.

GARTER

I see. And was Jim angry with Mary, too?

JANET

Yes. Mary laughed at Jim, so Jim was very angry.

GARTER

Mary laughed at Jim, you say? Not at Simon?

JANET

Yes, that's right.

GARTER

What happened then?

JANET

Well, Jim and Mary talked, then Mary went home.

GARTER

I see. And what did Jim do?

JANET

He sat there for five minutes. Then he went out.

GARTER

What about Simon and Dan? Where were they?

JANET

They stayed in the disco. One of them asked me to dance, but I said no. So after ten minutes he and his friend went out.

GARTER

Now I want to be sure about this. Jim went out first, you say, and these boys went out ten minutes after him. Is that right?

JANET

Er, ye-es, I think so. It's not easy to remember.

GARTER

Thank you.

He sits down and Ms Wills gets up.

MS WILLS

You're right, Miss Nolan. It isn't easy to remember things after six months, of course.

JANET

No, it isn't. But I can remember nearly everything.

MS WILLS

Did you watch Mary and Jim all the time in the disco?

JANET

No, of course not. But—

MS WILLS

No. So be careful, Miss Nolan. Perhaps you are wrong about this. It's a long time ago. Perhaps these boys went out before Jim? Not after him?

JANET

Perhaps. I don't know. I'm not sure.

MS WILLS

Thank you. That's all.

She sits down. Janet begins to go out of the witness box, then she stops.

JANET

No, I'm right! Jim did go out first - I'm sure!

JUDGE

Thank you, Miss Nolan. Thank you very much.

Simon and Dan tell their story

Simon Clark comes into the witness box.

SIMON

(Taking the book ) I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

GARTER

Now, Simon. This is very important. What happened on the night of 12 August? Tell me.

SIMON

All right. Well, I went out with Dan to look for a car. We often take cars, you see—

'We often take cars.'

JUDGE

You steal them, do you?

SIMON

Not steal , no. We take them for the night, drive for an hour or two, and leave them somewhere.

JUDGE

I see. Do you do this often?

SIMON

Yeah, why not? We like it. That night we took this white Ford Fiesta, and went to the disco in Trenton. We got there about ten o'clock, I think.

GARTER

Did you meet anyone in the disco?

SIMON

Yes. We danced with some girls. But it wasn't very exciting, so at about midnight we went out and drove away. Two hours later a police car stopped us. That's it.

GARTER

Now I want you to look at this photo of Mary Jones. Did you see her in the disco?

SIMON

Yes. Dan danced with her first, and then I danced with her. Then her boyfriend hit me.

GARTER

Did you hit him first?

SIMON

No, I didn't.

GARTER

Did you hit him after he hit you?

SIMON

No. He was bigger than me. And I never hit people.

GARTER

All right. Did you follow this girl out of the disco?

SIMON

No, I didn't see her go out. Dan and I talked for ten minutes, then we drove away. We didn't see the girl.

GARTER

Did you kill her?

SIMON

No, sir, I didn't.

GARTER

All right. (He sits down. Ms Wills stands up. )

MS WILLS

When Jim hit you, you did nothing. Right?

SIMON

Yes. That's right.

MS WILLS

And what did Mary do? Did she laugh?

SIMON

I'm not sure. Perhaps she did.

MS WILLS

She did, I think. Mary was a beautiful girl, and she laughed because her boyfriend hit you.

SIMON

I wasn't angry. She wasn't important to me.

MS WILLS

Not important? But you danced with her.

SIMON

She was OK. She wasn't very beautiful or interesting.

Mary's mother stands up. She is very angry.

MRS JONES

Don't you say that about my daughter! She was beautiful, and she was a lot better than you! She didn't steal cars or kill people!

'Don't you say that about my daughter!'

JUDGE

Please sit down, Mrs Jones. (She sits down. )

MS WILLS

You weren't angry, you say. That isn't true, Simon Clark. You were very angry with Mary!

SIMON

No, I wasn't. Why do you say that?

MS WILLS

You were angry with her because she laughed at you. So you and Dan followed her in the Fiesta. What happened then? You asked her to get in. Did she get in?

SIMON

No, she didn't.

MS WILLS

I see. She didn't get in the car, so you were angry again. Then you hit her with this spanner and killed her. Is that right?

SIMON

No. It's not true.

MS WILLS

Yes, it is. You murdered Mary Jones, Simon Clark! You killed her with this spanner!

SIMON

No, I didn't! I'm not guilty, I tell you!

MS WILLS

You are guilty, Simon. You killed Mary Jones.

She sits down. Simon goes out. Dan comes in.

DAN

(Taking the book ) I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

'I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.'

GARTER

Dan, you listened to Simon. Did he tell the truth?

DAN

Yes, of course he did.

GARTER

Did you see Jim hit your friend in the disco?

DAN

Yes, I did.

GARTER

And after that, did you see Jim go out?

DAN

Yes. The girl, Mary, went out first. Jim went later. We stayed, and went out ten minutes after Jim.

GARTER

And when you went out, did you see Jim or Mary?

DAN

No. We got in the car and drove away.

GARTER

All right, thank you. Wait there.

He sits down, and Ms Wills stands up.

MS WILLS

When Jim hit Simon, did Mary laugh at him?

DAN

Well, yes.

MS WILLS

Mary laughed at Simon?

DAN

Yes.

MS WILLS

So then Simon was angry with Mary, but you were both afraid of Jim. Is that right?

DAN

Well, perhaps, yes.

MS WILLS

Yes. So you waited in the disco. You were angry with Mary. She went out of the disco, and Jim wasn't with her. So you and Simon followed her in the car.

DAN

No, we didn't.

MS WILLS

Oh yes, you did. You stopped the car, and asked her to get in. But she didn't. Perhaps she laughed at you again. Then you were really angry.

DAN

NO! That's not true!

MS WILLS

Oh yes it is, Dan. How did Mary die? I know, and the jury know too. You killed her. But I'm not sure about one thing - who hit Mary first? Was it Simon?

DAN

No—

MS WILLS

It wasn't Simon, you say? Then it was you!

DAN

No, it wasn't! It wasn't me!

MS WILLS

So it was Simon?

DAN

No! It wasn't Simon or me! We didn't do it!

MS WILLS

Do you see this spanner, Dan? It has Mary's blood on it, and Mary's hair. And this spanner was in your car. Tell me, Dan - who put it there? You, or Simon?

DAN

I don't know. I didn't put it there. I didn't see it.

MS WILLS

That isn't true, Dan. The spanner was in your car because you murdered Mary Jones with it. That's true, and everybody knows it.

She sits down. Dan goes out of the witness box. Carter stands up.

GARTER

I have no more witnesses, my lord. (Sits down. )

JUDGE

Now, members of the jury, Ms Wills and Mr Carter are going to talk to you. Listen carefully.

MS WILLS

(Standing up ) Members of the jury, the police found this spanner in the Fiesta. It had Mary's blood and hair on it. They found tyre marks near Mary's body. There was blood on Simon's face, and under Mary's fingernails, too.

SIMON

Jim hit me in the disco! He cut my face!

JUDGE

Be quiet! Ms Wills is talking now, not you!

MS WILLS

Look at these two young men. They're angry now. Think about them. They aren't very nice young men. What do they do in the evenings? They steal cars.

DAN

Yes, but we don't kill people!

MS WILLS

You did, this time. You followed Mary, and you killed her. Think about it carefully, members of the jury. Mary is dead, and these young men are guilty of her murder.

She sits down, and Carter stands up.

'Members of the jury...'

MRS JONES

(Standing up ) That's right. They killed my beautiful daughter!

JUDGE

Please, Mrs Jones. You must sit down. Mr Carter is going to talk now. (She sits down. )

GARTER

Members of the jury, Mary Jones is dead, we know that. But did these two boys murder her? Are you sure about that? There are a lot of questions to answer.

MRS JONES

What questions? They're guilty! We know that!

JUDGE

Mrs Jones, you must sit down, or go out!

She sits down.

GARTER

Think about Janet Nolan. She says, 'Jim went out of the disco first - not Simon.' Think about the spanner. Did it come from Mrs Symes's car? Perhaps, perhaps not.

JIM

What about the tyre marks? The Fiesta had Pirelli tyres!

GARTER

Hundreds of cars have Pirelli tyres, Jim. Volkswagen Polos have them. And you have a Polo, Jim.

JIM

But my car doesn't have Pirelli tyres!

GARTER

Perhaps your car doesn't have Pirelli tyres today , Jim. But in August? Did you have Pirelli tyres then?

JIM

No, of course I didn't.

GARTER

Well, you say that now. But I'm not sure. And here's another question - what about the blood? There was a lot of blood on your shirt and trousers, Jim.

'There was a lot of blood on your shirt and trousers, Jim.'

JIM

Of course there was. I tried to help Mary!

GARTER

But was there any blood on Simon or Dan? No, members of the jury, there wasn't.

JIM

There was blood on Simon's face!

GARTER

Yes, but you hit him, Jim. There was no blood on Dan, or in the car. There was blood on you. And you're a big young man, Jim - you get angry very quickly. Mary was afraid of you.

JIM

That's not true! I loved her!

GARTER

Yes, Jim, but you were angry with her too. And you are angry now, we can see that.

JIM

I'm angry because Mary is dead, and they killed her!

GARTER

Did they, Jim? I'm not sure. Think carefully, members of the jury. Did Jim kill Mary? Perhaps - we don't know. But did Simon and Dan kill her? No. They are not guilty. (Carter sits down. )

JUDGE

Now, members of the jury, there is one big question for you, and you must answer it. Think very carefully. Did these two men kill Mary Jones? Are they guilty or not guilty of her murder?

'Are they guilty or not guilty?'

SIMON

I didn't! Be quiet!

JUDGE

Simon Clark and Dan Smith, you murdered Mary Jones - a young, beautiful girl. For this murder, there is only one punishment. You must go to prison for life.

Jim Wilson, come with me. I want to talk to you about your girlfriend, Mary Jones.

'Jim Wilson, come with me.'

玛丽·琼斯谋杀案


内容简介

玛丽是怎么死的？

陪审团成员、律师们和法庭书记员走进来坐下。然后西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯在两名警员的戒护下走了进来。法官走进来，所有人起立。法官走向他的椅子，缓缓地看着每个人，然后坐下。众人和律师坐下。西蒙、丹、两名警员和法庭书记员仍然站着。

书记员：

西蒙·克拉克，你因玛丽·琼斯谋杀案而出庭。你有没有杀她？

西蒙：

没有，先生。我没有。

书记员：

那你呢，丹·史密斯？是你杀了玛丽·琼斯吗？

丹：

没有，先生。我没有。我是清白的！

西蒙：

我们没有杀她！

书记员：

好。坐下。（他们坐下来。 ）

威尔斯女士：

（站起来 ）法官大人，我是警方律师海伦·威尔斯。戴维·卡特是西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯的律师。

法官：

很好。请开始吧，威尔斯女士。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢您，法官大人。各位陪审团成员，请看这张照片。照片上是一个女孩儿和一个年轻男子。她是玛丽·琼斯，他是玛丽的男朋友吉姆·威尔逊。（陪审团成员看照片。 ）

法官：

威尔斯女士，我还没拿到那张照片。

书记员：

哦，抱歉，法官大人。给您。

他递给法官一张照片。

法官：

谢谢。请继续，威尔斯女士。

威尔斯女士：

8月12日，玛丽和吉姆在托伦顿的一家迪斯科舞厅里。午夜时，她沿着海边的那条路独自往家走，然后有人杀了她。现在，请看第二张照片。

法官：

打断一下，威尔斯女士。（他举起一张照片。 ）这张照片？一个死亡女孩儿的照片？

威尔斯女士：

是的，法官大人，没错。抱歉，这张照片不太好。但是这也是玛丽·琼斯。她的头上和脸上都有血。

法官：

是，我清楚了。那晚有人在那儿发现她吗？

威尔斯女士：

有，法官大人，吉姆·威尔逊在大概十二点半的时候在靠路边的沙滩上发现了她的尸体。他想要救她，但是他无能为力。玛丽·琼斯已经死了。

法官：

她是怎么死的，威尔斯女士？

威尔斯女士：

有人用扳手击打了她头部四次，法官大人。书记员，我可以拿一下那个扳手吗？

书记员：

可以，给你。（他递给她一个扳手。 ）

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。就是这个扳手，各位陪审团成员。请仔细看。这个扳手上沾有玛丽的血和头发。能看到吗？

她把扳手展示给陪审团看。

法官：

我能看看吗，威尔斯女士？

威尔斯女士：

当然可以，法官大人。（她把扳手递给他。 ）

法官：

谢谢。但是是谁用这个扳手打了她呢，威尔斯女士？这是关键问题，你知道。谁杀了她？

威尔斯女士：

谁杀了她？我认为是西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯。

法官：

你为什么这么认为？请给陪审团讲一讲。

威尔斯女士：

好的，法官大人。他们那晚在那家迪斯科舞厅。他们是开车去的，开了一辆白色的福特嘉年华。那不是他们的车——是他们偷来的。他们经常偷车。

法官：

我明白了。他们在那儿待了多久？

威尔斯女士：

他们在迪斯科舞厅待了两个小时。差不多十点的时候，丹和玛丽·琼斯跳了舞。之后，西蒙·克拉克又和她跳了舞。

法官：

打断一下，威尔斯女士。吉姆看到这些了吗？

威尔斯女士：

是的，法官大人，他看到了。他非常生气，还打了西蒙。然后他和玛丽谈了半个小时，之后玛丽就一个人往家走了。

法官：

那吉姆还留在迪斯科舞厅里？

威尔斯女士：

是的，法官大人，他留下来了。但是丹和西蒙没有。他们出去了，就在玛丽走后十分钟。他们开着那辆嘉年华走了。

法官：

好的。可是有人看见 他们杀了她吗？这很重要。

威尔斯女士：

没有，没人看到他们杀了她。但是警察在玛丽尸体旁发现了一辆福特嘉年华车的轮胎印。并且后来他们在比尔斯福德发现了在白色嘉年华车里的丹和西蒙。

法官：

比尔斯福德在哪儿，威尔斯女士？

威尔斯女士：

离托伦顿有十公里，法官大人。并且车上有个扳手。就是这个扳手，陪审团的各位！上面沾着玛丽的血和头发！（她把扳手展示给陪审团看。 ）

法官：

我明白了。这非常重要。（他记录着。 ）

威尔斯女士：

是的，法官大人。这两个男孩儿从迪斯科舞厅出来后就开着白色嘉年华尾随玛丽。他们停下车，用这个扳手打她的头，然后开车离开。

丹：

（站起来 ）这不是真的！我们没有尾随她！我们没走那条路！这不是真的！

法官：

安静，年轻人！坐下！你可以稍后再说！

威尔斯女士：

我要请出我的第一位证人，诺顿警员。

诺顿警员走向证人席。

书记员：

（递给他一本书 ）右手拿书，读出上面的话。

诺顿：

我保证如实供述，毫无隐瞒。

威尔斯女士：

诺顿警员，8月12日发生了什么事？

诺顿：

嗯，午夜12点47分的时候有人打电话报了警，然后我赶到了托伦顿沙滩旁的那条路上。我发现沙滩那儿有一具年轻女子的尸体，还有一个小伙子。他叫吉姆·威尔逊。

威尔斯女士：

我明白了。是吉姆报的警吗？

诺顿：

是的，是他。我想他是玛丽的男朋友。他想要救她，但是她已经死了。

威尔斯女士：

尸体在哪儿？

诺顿：

在靠路边的沙滩上。尸体附近的沙子上有轮胎印。我想应该是有辆车在那儿停了一下，然后又开回托伦顿了。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。请稍等一下，然后回答卡特先生的问题。（她坐下来。 ）

卡特：

（站起来 ）诺顿警员，再跟我说说玛丽的男朋友吉姆·威尔逊。你说他想救这个死去的女孩儿。那他的衬衫和裤子上沾上血了吗？

诺顿：

是的，先生，沾上了。他的脸上、手上沾上血了，衬衫和裤子上也沾到血了。

卡特：

你问他有关这些血的事了吗？

诺顿：

问了，先生。他说因为想要救她才沾上血的。他坐在我车里哭了起来。他说他爱她。

卡特：

我明白了。但是吉姆为什么在沙滩上呢？

诺顿：

他说他从迪斯科舞厅出来后去散步。

卡特：

我明白了。非常感谢。（他坐下来。 ）

法官：

诺顿警员，还有个问题。吉姆的脸上或手上有没有伤口？

诺顿：

我不知道，先生。他脸上和手上都有血，但是我想那是玛丽·琼斯的血。

法官：

谢谢。没有问题了。我想下一位证人是塞尔登医生吧。（塞尔登医生走进来，书记员把那本书递给他。 ）

塞尔登：

我保证如实供述，毫无隐瞒。

威尔斯女士：

塞尔登医生，你检查过玛丽·琼斯的尸体。你有什么发现吗？

塞尔登：

玛丽·琼斯是个大概18岁的年轻女子。有人击打她的头部四次导致她死亡。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。你也非常仔细地检查过这个扳手。能给我们说一说吗？

塞尔登：

可以。我检查过扳手，发现上面有血和头发。血和头发都是玛丽·琼斯的。

威尔斯女士：

你确定吗？

塞尔登：

确定。是一样的。

威尔斯女士：

所以说有人用这个扳手杀了她？

塞尔登：

嗯，是的。我很确定。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。请稍等。

威尔斯女士坐下来，卡特站起来。

卡特：

塞尔登医生，我想问问玛丽·琼斯的手。她的手上有血吗？

塞尔登：

有的，先生，有很多血。我检查得很仔细，是她的血。可能扳手打到她的时候她用手捂着头。

卡特：

但是她的指甲缝里也有血吗？

塞尔登：

是的，有一点儿。

卡特：

你也仔细检验了那儿的血吗？

塞尔登：

不，我没有。她手上有很多血，都是她的血。这点我敢肯定。

卡特：

好的，但是仔细想想，医生。那个人打她的时候，玛丽·琼斯做了什么？她也想要打他吗？或许她用指甲划破了他的脸？女孩儿有时会这么做吗？

塞尔登：

嗯，是的，有时会。

卡特：

所以她指甲缝里有可能留有凶手的血。你检查了吗？

塞尔登：

她的指甲缝里没多少血。

卡特：

但是你有没有检查 ，医生？你仔细检查她指甲缝里的血了吗？

塞尔登：

没有。抱歉，我没检查。

卡特：

我明白了。但是她指甲缝里是有 血的。这点你能肯定吗？

塞尔登：

是的，有一点儿血。不多。

卡特坐下来。塞尔登走出去。莫兰警员走进来，从书记员手里接过那本书。

莫兰：

我保证如实供述，毫无隐瞒。

威尔斯女士：

莫兰警员，我想你检查过那辆白色福特嘉年华。你有什么发现？

莫兰：

嗯，我先是在每个轮胎下面放了些纸，然后开车碾过去。轮胎印就留在纸上了。然后我把纸拿到沙滩那儿，检查了沙滩上的轮胎印。

威尔斯女士：

它们有什么不同吗？

莫兰：

没有，是一样的。沙滩上的轮胎印是倍耐力ZX37轮胎留下的，纸上的轮胎印也是倍耐力ZX37轮胎的。

威尔斯女士：

你在车里发现其他什么东西了吗？

莫兰：

发现了。车里有很多沙滩上的沙子。

威尔斯女士：

我明白了。这很有意思。非常感谢。请稍等。（她坐下来。 ）

卡特：

（站起来 ）莫兰警员，所有的福特嘉年华配的都是倍耐力ZX37的轮胎吗？

莫兰：

不是。福特嘉年华可以配很多不同的轮胎。

卡特：

那大众保罗呢？有时也配倍耐力ZX37的轮胎吗？

莫兰：

有时也配，先生。

卡特：

我明白了。所以说很多车都配这种轮胎。有些是福特嘉年华，但是有些是大众保罗。是吧？

莫兰：

没错，是的。

卡特：

所以可能是一辆保罗在沙滩上留下了这些轮胎印？

莫兰：

有可能，是的。

卡特：

谢谢。好，车上有很多沙子。车上也有血或头发吗？

莫兰：

不，没有。

卡特：

什么？没有头发和血迹？你检查了吗？

莫兰：

是的，先生，我们检查过。但是我们什么也没发现。

卡特：

可威尔斯女士说：“这两个年轻人杀了玛丽·琼斯。”玛丽的头上和脸上有血，裙子上有血，手上有血。但是你说车上没有血？

莫兰：

没有，先生，车上没有血和头发。

卡特：

我明白了。谢谢，莫兰警员。这很有意思。（他坐下来。 ）

莫兰走出去，女警员格雷走进来。

格雷：

（拿着书 ）我保证如实供述，毫无隐瞒。

威尔斯女士：

格雷警员，你发现西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯在那辆白色福特嘉年华里。发生了什么事？

格雷：

嗯，那天晚上十点钟，有一位赛姆斯太太打电话报警。“我找不到我的车了。”她说。车是白色福特嘉年华，车牌号是M346 WXT。

威尔斯女士：

你找这辆车了吗？

格雷：

找了。凌晨两点钟的时候，我们在比尔斯福德找到了。西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯在车里，于是我们问了他们许多问题。

威尔斯女士：

他们怎么说？

格雷：

他们说是在八点偷的车。然后开到托伦顿的一家迪斯科舞厅，在那儿待到午夜前后。

威尔斯女士：

那你在车里发现了什么？

格雷：

一个扳手，还有很多沙子。那两个年轻人的鞋里也有沙子。

威尔斯女士：

那个扳手，他们怎么说？

格雷：

什么都没说。他们说：“扳手？什么扳手？”

威尔斯女士：

他们鞋里为什么会有沙子？你问他们了吗？

格雷：

问了。他们说在沙滩上散了会儿步。

威尔斯女士：

你看到这两个年轻人身上有血吗？

格雷：

有，我看到了。西蒙·克拉克脸上有血。他左眼下面有两道小划痕。

威尔斯女士：

你问他这是怎么回事了吗？

格雷：

问了。他说：“在迪斯科舞厅里有个男的打了我。他的手划到了我。”

威尔斯女士：

我明白了。非常感谢。请稍等。（她坐下来，卡特站起来。 ）

卡特：

我只有两个问题，格雷警员。你在这两个年轻人的鞋上发现血了吗？

格雷：

没有，先生。鞋上有很多沙子，但没有血。

卡特：

他们的衬衫或裤子上有血吗？或许是西蒙的脸被划伤流的血？

格雷：

没有，先生，没有血。那都是很小的划痕。

卡特：

谢谢。（他坐下来。 ）

第二场吉姆的讲述

吉姆的讲述

吉姆·威尔逊走向证人席。

书记员：

（把那本书递给他 ）右手拿书，读出上面的话。

吉姆：

我保证如实供述，毫无隐瞒。

威尔斯女士：

（站起来 ）吉姆，跟我说说玛丽。你很了解她吗？

吉姆：

非常了解。她是我的女朋友。我们两家每年的同一时间都会来托伦顿度假。

威尔斯女士：

我明白了。那能请你说说8月12日星期六那天晚上的事儿吗？

吉姆：

嗯，我和玛丽八点半的时候去了那家迪斯科舞厅。我们坐在桌旁和朋友聊天。然后我们跳舞，聊天，跳舞，之后玛丽就回家了。

威尔斯女士：

她什么时候回去的？

吉姆：

我想大概——午夜吧。我不记得了。

威尔斯女士：

你在迪斯科舞厅里见没见到不认识的人？

吉姆：

见到了。两个年轻男的。他们和玛丽跳了舞。

威尔斯女士：

你看那两个年轻男的现在在这里吗？

吉姆：

在。他们就在那儿。他们杀了她！（他愤怒地看着西蒙·克拉克和丹·史密斯。 ）

丹：

（站起来 ）我们没有杀她！不是这样的！

法官：

行了，史密斯先生。坐下！

丹慢慢坐下来。

威尔斯女士：

发生这样的事我也很难过。吉姆，那你告诉我，玛丽离开迪斯科舞厅之后你干什么了？

吉姆：

嗯，我又待了十五分钟，和一些朋友聊天。然后我出去散步——就看到她了。她脸上有血。我想要救她，可救不了。

威尔斯女士：

于是你做了什么？

吉姆：

我跑去打电话报警。但是没有用。她已经死了——是他们杀了她！

他看着丹和西蒙。威尔斯女士坐下来。

卡特：

（站起来 ）吉姆，你爱玛丽吗？

吉姆：

是的，我想是的——她是我女朋友。

卡特：

是的，他是你女朋友。你爱她——你想。你说玛丽在午夜离开了迪斯科舞厅。她独自沿着海边那条漆黑的路走。你没有跟她一起。为什么？

吉姆：

为什么？我不知道——她想一个人走。

卡特：

为什么？她在生你的气？

吉姆：

我不知道。有点儿生气，可能吧。那不重要。

卡特：

你生这两个年轻人的气吗？生西蒙和丹的气，因为他们和她跳了舞？

吉姆：

有一点儿生气，是的。

卡特：

你说有一点儿生气。你看到他们和她跳舞了吗？

吉姆：

我看到西蒙和她跳舞了，但是没看到丹。我跟一些朋友出去了。他们想看看我的车。

卡特：

看你的车？为什么？你的车很特别吗？

吉姆：

是辆新车——大众保罗。我很喜欢它。我的朋友们想去看看它。

卡特：

我明白了。你返回以后发生了什么？

吉姆：

我看到玛丽和那个小子在一起。（他看着西蒙。 ）

卡特：

接着你做了什么？

吉姆：

我很生气。我要求他不要和她跳舞。

卡特：

你说你要求 他。你打他了吗，吉姆？

吉姆：

嗯，打了。打了一下。但是是他先打我的！

西蒙：

不是这样的！我没打你！是你 打的我 ！

法官：

安静，克拉克先生！行了！

西蒙：

但是事实不是这样的，法官大人！我没打他！

法官：

可能没有。但是你稍后才能说话。明白了吗？

西蒙：

明白了，先生。

卡特：

你打西蒙的时候玛丽做了什么，吉姆？

吉姆：

她笑了，我想。然后她和我在桌旁坐下了。

卡特：

她为什么笑，吉姆？是笑西蒙，还是笑你？

吉姆：

她在笑西蒙，因为他害怕我！

卡特：

是这样吗？还是她是在笑你，吉姆？可能她喜欢的是西蒙，不是你！

吉姆：

当然不是！她是我的 女朋友，她是和我 在一起的，不是和他们！

卡特：

但是你生玛丽的气，吉姆。为什么？也许她喜欢他们比喜欢你更多一点？

吉姆：

不可能！我没有生她 的气，我是生西蒙的气！

卡特：

你确定吗？

吉姆：

是的，当然！我生他的气是因为他和我女朋友跳舞，因为他杀了她。难道你不明白吗？他杀了她 ！我当然生气了——他杀了她 ！

卡特：

你怎么知道，吉姆？

吉姆：

所有人都知道！他开车在那条路上跟着她。然后从车里拿出扳手打她的头——两次，三次！然后她边哭边向沙滩跑。

卡特：

之后发生了什么，吉姆？

吉姆：

他又打她！然后她就不动了，到处都是血！很多血！我想要救她，但是救不了，她死了——

吉姆哭起来。卡特有一会儿没说话。

卡特：

好，吉姆，你说她哭着跑到沙滩上，他又打了她。你是怎么知道的？

吉姆：

怎么知道的？我不记得了。警察说的。

卡特：

不，吉姆，警察没这么说。（他等着，但是吉姆不说话。 ）吉姆，西蒙和丹的身上都没有血，而你 身上却有很多血。而且你生玛丽的气，因为她不爱你。是这样吗，吉姆？

吉姆：

不是。

卡特：

西蒙和丹没在沙滩上，吉姆。他们没有杀她。而你 在那儿。你从迪斯科舞厅出来跟着她。是你 杀了她吗？

吉姆：

不是！我当然没有！你在说什么啊？他们 杀了她——他们的 车在那儿，扳手在他们的 车里！我没有杀她！她是我的女朋友——我爱 她！

卡特：

你说你爱她。但是那么漆黑的夜晚你却没有陪她走回家，吉姆。为什么没有呢？

吉姆：

可是我陪她了！我去追她了！我在沙滩上发现了她！她已经死了！

卡特：

你开车去的吗？你那辆新保罗？

吉姆：

不，我没有。我走着去的。我要想想。

卡特：

你要想什么？

吉姆：

想想我和玛丽。我很抱歉——我爱她，你知道——而且当然了，我想跟她说话。但是她死了！他们杀了她，她死了！

卡特：

但是他们身上没有血，车上也没有，吉姆。血在你 身上！也许你爱玛丽，但也是你杀了她——因为你生她的气！

吉姆：

没有！我当然没有！我没有杀她。我爱她！

卡特：

还有个问题，吉姆。你的大众保罗配的是倍耐力轮胎吗？

吉姆：

什么？呃——不。不，我没配。我用固特异轮胎。

卡特：

好的。我没有问题了。（他坐下来。 ）

吉姆走出去，威尔斯女士站起来。

威尔斯女士：

法官大人，我方没有证人了。

法官：

谢谢。卡特先生，你有证人吗？

卡特：

有，法官大人。请露西·赛姆斯太太出庭。

露西·赛姆斯走上证人席。

赛姆斯：

（拿着书 ）我保证如实陈述，毫无隐瞒。

卡特：

赛姆斯太太，你有辆白色福特嘉年华吗？

赛姆斯：

是的，先生。

卡特：

车牌号是多少？

赛姆斯：

M346 WXT。

卡特：

8月12日那辆车怎么了？

赛姆斯：

被人偷了，先生。我打电话报了警，他们第二天找到了它。车里有很多沙子。

卡特：

我明白了。好，赛姆斯太太，你车里有扳手吗，像桌上这个扳手这样的？

赛姆斯：

嗯，我不知道，先生。你知道，去年我车里确实有个像这样的扳手，但是不好用。所以我现在换了个更好的。

卡特：

我明白了。这个新扳手现在在哪儿？

赛姆斯：

在我车后头，先生。它一直在那儿。

卡特：

旧扳手呢？它在哪儿？

赛姆斯：

嗯，我不知道，先生。我不想要那个了，你知道。

卡特：

8月12日那天旧扳手在车上吗？

赛姆斯：

我不知道。可能在，但我不确定。

卡特：

谢谢，赛姆斯太太。请稍等。

他坐下来，威尔斯女士站起来。

威尔斯女士：

赛姆斯太太，当时你的旧扳手在不在车上？

赛姆斯：

我不确定。抱歉，我不知道。

威尔斯女士：

那好，可能你把它放在车后面，然后忘了这回事。

赛姆斯：

是，有可能。

威尔斯女士：

好的。（她从桌上拿起扳手，递给赛姆斯太太。 ）这把扳手像你那个旧 扳手吗？

赛姆斯：

我想是的。是，像。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。（她坐下来。 ）

赛姆斯太太离开。珍妮特·诺兰走上证人席，从书记员手中接过书。

珍妮特：

我保证如实陈述，毫无隐瞒。

卡特：

诺兰小姐，8月12日那晚你在那家迪斯科舞厅。你看到玛丽·琼斯了吗？

珍妮特：

看到了，我看见她和她男朋友吉姆在一起。之后她和那两个男孩儿跳了舞。

卡特：

哪两个男孩儿？

珍妮特：

那两个。（她看着西蒙和丹。 ）

卡特：

我明白了。她和他们跳了很长时间吗？

珍妮特：

差不多十分钟，嗯。她先和丹跳，然后又和西蒙跳。吉姆那时不在迪斯科舞厅里。吉姆看到他们的时候很生气。

卡特：

他做了什么？

珍妮特：

他打了西蒙。

卡特：

那西蒙做了什么？

珍妮特：

什么都没做。他没打吉姆。他走开了。

卡特：

我明白了。吉姆也生玛丽的气吗？

珍妮特：

是的。玛丽嘲笑吉姆，所以吉姆很生气。

卡特：

你说玛丽嘲笑吉姆？而不是西蒙？

珍妮特：

是，是这样的。

卡特：

后来发生了什么？

珍妮特：

嗯，吉姆和玛丽说话，然后玛丽就回家了。

卡特：

我明白了。那吉姆又做了什么？

珍妮特：

他在那儿坐了五分钟。然后出去了。

卡特：

西蒙和丹呢？他们在哪儿？

珍妮特：

他们待在迪斯科舞厅里。他们其中一个人找我跳舞，但我拒绝了。于是十分钟之后，他和他朋友就出去了。

卡特：

现在我要确认一下。你说吉姆先出去，这两个男孩儿在他走了十分钟之后 才出去。是这样吗？

珍妮特：

呃，是——是吧，我想是。记不太清了。

卡特：

谢谢。

他坐下来，威尔斯女士站起来。

威尔斯女士：

没错，诺兰小姐。六个月前的事情当然不容易记清楚。

珍妮特：

是的，不太容易。但是我几乎能记得所有的事。

威尔斯女士：

你在迪斯科舞厅的时候一直看着玛丽和吉姆吗？

珍妮特：

不，当然不是。但是——

威尔斯女士：

不是。那要小心，诺兰小姐。你可能记错了。时隔太久。有可能这两个男孩儿是在吉姆之前 出去的？而不是之后 ？

珍妮特：

有可能。我不知道。我不确定。

威尔斯女士：

谢谢。没有问题了。

她坐下来。珍妮特迈步走出证人席，然后她停了下来。

珍妮特：

不，我是对的！吉姆是 先走的——我肯定！

法官：

谢谢，诺兰小姐。非常感谢。

第三场西蒙和丹的讲述

西蒙和丹的讲述

西蒙·克拉克走上证人席。

西蒙：

（拿着书 ）我保证如实陈述，毫无隐瞒。

卡特：

嘿，西蒙。这很重要。8月12日晚上发生了什么事？告诉我。

西蒙：

好的。嗯，我和丹出去物色车。我们经常弄些车来开，你知道——

法官：

你们偷车，是吗？

西蒙：

不是偷 ，不是。我们晚上弄来开开，开一两个小时，然后就把车扔在什么地方。

法官：

我明白了。你们经常这么干吗？

西蒙：

是的，为什么不？我们喜欢这么做。那天晚上我们弄了这辆白色福特嘉年华，去了托伦顿的那家迪斯科舞厅。我想我们是十点左右到的。

卡特：

你们在舞厅遇到什么人了吗？

西蒙：

遇到了。我们和几个女孩儿跳了舞。但是不是很好玩。所以十二点左右我们就出去开车走了。两个小时后，一辆警车把我们拦住了。就是这样。

卡特：

现在我想让你看看这张玛丽·琼斯的照片。你在迪斯科舞厅见过她吗？

西蒙：

见过。丹先和她跳的舞，接着我又和她跳了。然后她男朋友打了我。

卡特：

是你先打的他吗？

西蒙：

不是，我没有。

卡特：

他打你之后你还手了吗？

西蒙：

没有。他比我块儿头大。况且我从来不打人。

卡特：

好的。你是跟着这个女孩儿离开舞厅的吗？

西蒙：

不是，我没看见她出去。我和丹聊了十分钟，然后我们就开车走了。我们没见到这个女孩儿。

卡特：

是你杀了她吗？

西蒙：

不，先生，我没有。

卡特：

好的。（他坐下来。威尔斯女士站起来。 ）

威尔斯女士：

吉姆打你的时候，你什么都没做。是这样吗？

西蒙：

是。是这样。

威尔斯女士：

那玛丽做了什么？她笑了吗？

西蒙：

我不确定。她可能笑了。

威尔斯女士：

我想她笑了。玛丽是个漂亮女孩儿，她笑是因为她男朋友打了你。

西蒙：

我没生气。她对我来说并不重要。

威尔斯女士：

不重要？但是你和她跳了舞。

西蒙：

她就一般吧。她不是特别漂亮，也不是很好玩儿。

玛丽的妈妈站起来。她很生气。

琼斯太太：

不许你这么说我女儿！她是 很漂亮的，她比你可好太多了！她没偷过车，也没杀过人！

法官：

请坐下，琼斯太太。（她坐下来。 ）

威尔斯女士：

你说你没生气。那不是实话，西蒙·克拉克。你对玛丽非常 生气！

西蒙：

不，我没有。你为什么这么说？

威尔斯女士：

你生她的气是因为她嘲笑你。所以你和丹开着嘉年华尾随她。然后发生了什么？你让她上车。她究竟 上车了吗？

西蒙：

不，她没有。

威尔斯女士：

我明白了。她没有上车，所以你又很生气。然后你就用这个扳手打她，杀了她。对吗？

西蒙：

不对。不是这样。

威尔斯女士：

没错，是这样的。你杀害了玛丽·琼斯，西蒙·克拉克！你用这个扳手杀了她！

西蒙：

不是，我没有！我没罪，我告诉你！

威尔斯女士：

你有 罪，西蒙。你杀了玛丽·琼斯。

她坐下来。西蒙走出证人席。丹走上证人席。

丹：

（拿着书 ）我保证如实陈述，毫无隐瞒。

卡特：

丹，你听到西蒙的话了。他说的是实话吗？

丹：

是，他说的当然是实话。

卡特：

你在迪斯科舞厅看到吉姆打你的朋友了吗？

丹：

是的，我看到了。

卡特：

打完之后，你看到吉姆出去了吗？

丹：

看到了。那个女孩儿，玛丽，先出去的。吉姆过了一会儿才出去。我们还待在那儿，吉姆走了十分钟之后我们才走。

卡特：

那你们出去的时候，看到吉姆或者玛丽了吗？

丹：

没有。我们上了车就开走了。

卡特：

好的，谢谢。稍等。

他坐下来，威尔斯女士站起来。

威尔斯女士：

吉姆打西蒙的时候，玛丽嘲笑他了吗？

丹：

嗯，是的。

威尔斯女士：

玛丽嘲笑了西蒙？

丹：

是的。

威尔斯女士：

所以西蒙就生玛丽的气，但是你们俩都怕吉姆。对吗？

丹：

嗯，可能吧，是的。

威尔斯女士：

好。所以你们就在迪斯科舞厅里等着。你们生玛丽的气。她走出迪斯科舞厅，吉姆没跟她一起。于是你和西蒙就开车跟着她。

丹：

不是，我们没有。

威尔斯女士：

哦，没错，你们尾随了她。你们停下车，让她上车。但是她不愿意。有可能她又嘲笑了你们。然后你们特别生气。

丹：

不是！不是这样的！

威尔斯女士：

哦，没错，是这样的，丹。玛丽是怎么死的？我知道，陪审团也知道。你们杀了她。但是有一件事我不清楚——是谁先打的玛丽？是西蒙吗？

丹：

不——

威尔斯女士：

你说不是西蒙？那就是你了！

丹：

不，不是！不是我！

威尔斯女士：

那是西蒙了？

丹：

不是！不是西蒙，也不是我！我们没有杀她 ！

威尔斯女士：

你看到这个扳手了吗，丹？这上面有玛丽的血，还有玛丽的头发。而这个扳手在你们车里。告诉我，丹——是谁把它放进车里去的？你，还是西蒙？

丹：

我不知道。不是我放的。我没见过它。

威尔斯女士：

这不是实话，丹。这个扳手在你们车里，因为你们用它杀害了玛丽·琼斯。这是事实，所有人都知道。

她坐下来。丹走出证人席。卡特站起来。

卡特：

我方没有其他证人了，法官大人。（他坐下。 ）

法官：

现在，各位陪审团成员，威尔斯女士和卡特先生要向你们作陈述。仔细听着。

威尔斯女士：

（站起来 ）各位陪审团成员，警方在那辆嘉年华车上发现了这个扳手。扳手上面有玛丽的血和头发。他们在玛丽的尸体附近发现了轮胎印。西蒙的脸上有血迹，玛丽的指甲缝里也有。

西蒙：

吉姆在舞厅打了我！他划伤了我的脸！

法官：

安静！现在是威尔斯女士做陈述，不是你！

威尔斯女士：

看看这两个年轻人。他们现在很生气。想想他们。他们不是什么好小子。他们在晚上做什么？他们偷车。

丹：

是，但是我们不杀人！

威尔斯女士：

这次，你们杀人了。你们尾随玛丽，然后杀了她。仔细想想吧，各位陪审团成员。玛丽死了，这两个年轻人就是凶手。

她坐下来，卡特站起来。

琼斯太太：

（站起来 ）没错。他们杀了我的漂亮女儿。

法官：

拜托，琼斯太太。你必须坐下。现在卡特先生要做陈述了。（她坐下来。 ）

卡特：

各位陪审团成员，玛丽·琼斯死了，我们知道。但是是这两个男孩儿杀了她吗？你们确定吗？这其间有很多问题需要解答。

琼斯太太：

什么问题？他们有罪！我们知道！

法官：

琼斯太太，你要么坐下，要么出去！

她坐下来。

卡特：

想想珍妮特·诺兰。她说吉姆 先离开了舞厅——而不是西蒙。想想这个扳手。这是赛姆斯太太车上的扳手吗？可能是，也可能不是。

吉姆：

那轮胎印呢？那辆嘉年华配的是倍耐力的轮胎！

卡特：

成百上千的车都配有倍耐力的轮胎，吉姆。大众保罗就用这种轮胎。而你刚好有辆保罗，吉姆。

吉姆：

但是我的车配的不是倍耐力的轮胎！

卡特：

可能你的车现在 配的不是倍耐力的轮胎，吉姆。但是八月份的时候呢？你那时候配的是倍耐力的轮胎吗？

吉姆：

不是，当然不是。

卡特：

那好，你现在这么说，但是我可不确定。还有个问题——血迹怎么解释？你的衬衫和裤子上有很多血，吉姆。

吉姆：

当然有了。我想要救玛丽！

卡特：

但是西蒙或丹身上有血迹吗？没有，各位陪审团成员，他们身上没有。

吉姆：

西蒙的脸上有血！

卡特：

是，但是是你打了他，吉姆。丹身上没有血，车上也没有。你身上有血。你是个大块儿头的小伙子，吉姆——你很容易生气。玛丽害怕你。

吉姆：

不是这样的！我爱她！

卡特：

是的，吉姆，但是你也生她的气。你现在就生气了，我们能看出来。

吉姆：

我生气是因为玛丽死了，是他们杀了她！

卡特：

是他们吗，吉姆？我不确定。仔细想想吧，各位陪审团成员。是吉姆杀了玛丽吗？有可能——我们不知道。但是是西蒙和丹杀了她吗？不是。他们没有罪。（卡特坐下来。 ）

法官：

好了，各位陪审团成员，现在有个很重要的问题，你们必须给出答案。认认真真地考虑一下。是这两个年轻人杀害了玛丽·琼斯吗？他们是否犯有谋杀罪呢？

内容简介


火车是一个封闭的世界。每个包厢都像一个小房间，有门有窗。不过火车行驶时，你不能出去。外面的世界很遥远，你可以不去想你的家庭、工作和朋友。在火车上，你和陌生人坐在一起。你对他们一无所知，但却要和他们在同一个小房间里，在他们旁边坐上几个小时，或许几天。你无法摆脱他们。

随着车轮滚滚向前，这些故事向我们展现了三个不同的人物。一个年轻漂亮的妻子——和她的新婚丈夫穿过英格兰的绿色山丘去度假。一个逍遥自在的年轻人——穿越南斯拉夫的山脉去找工作。一个明达事理的中年人——穿过芬兰的森林湖泊北上，期盼有个安静的旅程。

三段不同的旅行，三个不同的人物——都关在火车这个封闭的世界里——一个什么事情都可能发生的地方。

ONE-WAY TICKET

SHORT STORIES

A train is a closed world. Each carriage is like a small room, with windows and doors, but you can't get out when the train is moving. The world outside is far away, and you can forget your home, your work, your friends. On a train you sit with strangers. You don't know anything about them, but you sit next to them for hours, or perhaps days, in the same small room. You can't get away from them.

As the wheels of the train turn, these stories show us three different people. A beautiful young wife – going on holiday with her new husband, through the green hills of England. A carefree young man – travelling across the mountains of Yugoslavia, looking for work. A sensible middle-aged man – travelling north through the forests and lakes of Finland, hoping for a quiet journey.

Three different journeys, three different people – all locked in the closed world of the train... where anything can happen.





'Of course,' the man in the brown hat said, 'there are good policemen and there are bad policemen, you know.'

'You're right,' the young man said. 'Yes. That's very true. Isn't it, Julie?' He looked at the young woman next to him.

Julie didn't answer and looked bored. She closed her eyes.

'Julie's my wife,' the young man told the man in the brown hat, 'she doesn't like trains. She always feels ill on trains.'

'Oh yes?' the man in the brown hat said. 'Now my wife – she doesn't like buses. She nearly had an accident on a bus once. It was last year... No, no, it wasn't. It was two years ago. I remember now. It was in Manchester.' He told a long, boring story about his wife and a bus in Manchester.

It was a hot day and the train was slow. There were seven people in the carriage. There was the man in the brown hat; the young man and his wife, Julie; a mother and two children; and a tall dark man in an expensive suit.

The young man's name was Bill. He had short brown hair and a happy smile. His wife, Julie, had long red hair and very green eyes – the colour of sea water. They were very beautiful eyes.

The man in the brown hat talked and talked. He had a big red face and a loud voice. He talked to Bill because Bill liked to talk too. The man in the brown hat laughed a lot and when he laughed, Bill laughed too. Bill liked talking and laughing with people.

The two children were hot and bored. They didn't want to sit down. They wanted to be noisy and run up and down the train.

'Now sit down and be quiet,' their mother said. She was a small woman with a tired face and a tired voice.

'I don't want to sit down,' the little boy said, 'I'm thirsty.'

'Here. Have an orange,' his mother said. She took an orange out of her bag and gave it to him.

'I want an orange too,' the little girl said loudly.

'All right. Here you are,' said her mother. 'Eat it nicely, now.'

The children ate their oranges and were quiet for a minute.

Then the little boy said, 'I want a drink. I'm thirsty.'

The tall dark man took out his newspaper and began to read. Julie opened her eyes and looked at the back page of his newspaper. She read about the weather in Budapest and about the football in Liverpool. She wasn't interested in Budapest and she didn't like football, but she didn't want to listen to Bill and the man in the brown hat. 'Talk, talk, talk,' she thought. 'Bill never stops talking.'

Julie opened her eyes and looked at the back page of the tall dark man's newspaper.

Then suddenly she saw the tall man's eyes over the top of his newspaper. She could not see his mouth, but there was a smile in his eyes. Quickly, she looked down at the newspaper and read about the weather in Budapest again.

The train stopped at Dawlish station and people got on and got off. There was a lot of noise.

'Is this our station?' the little girl asked. She went to the window and looked out.

'No, it isn't. Now sit down,' her mother said.

'We're going to Penzance,' the little girl told Bill. 'For our holidays.'

'Yes,' her mother said. 'My sister's got a little hotel by the sea. We're staying there. It's cheap, you see.'

'Yes,' the man in the brown hat said. 'It's a nice town. I know a man there. He's got a restaurant in King Street. A lot of holiday people go there. He makes a lot of money in the summer.' He laughed loudly. 'Yes,' he said again. 'You can have a nice holiday in Penzance.'

'We're going to St Austell,' Bill said. 'Me and Julie. It's our first holiday. Julie wanted to go to Spain, but I like St Austell. I always go there for my holidays. It's nice in August. You can have a good time there too.

Julie looked out of the window. 'Where is Budapest?' she thought. 'I want to go there. I want to go to Vienna, to Paris, to Rome, to Athens.' Her green eyes were bored and angry. Through the window she watched the little villages and hills of England.

The man in the brown hat looked at Julie. 'You're right,' he said to Bill. 'You can have a good time on holiday in England. We always go to Brighton, me and the wife. But the weather! We went one year, and it rained every day. Morning, afternoon, and night. It's true. It never stopped raining.' He laughed loudly. 'We nearly went home after the first week.'

Bill laughed too. 'What did you do all day, then?' he asked.

Julie read about the weather in Budapest for the third time. Then she looked at the tall man's hands. They were long, brown hands, very clean. 'Nice hands,' she thought. He wore a very expensive Japanese watch. 'Japan,' she thought. 'I'd like to go to Japan.' She looked up and saw the man's eyes again over the top of his newspaper. This time she did not look away. Green eyes looked into dark brown eyes for a long, slow minute.

Green eyes looked into dark brown eyes for a long, slow minute.

After Newton Abbot station the guard came into the carriage to look at their tickets. 'Now then,' he said, 'where are we all going?'

'This train's late,' the man in the brown hat said. 'Twenty minutes late, by my watch.'

'Ten minutes,' the guard said. 'That's all.' He smiled at Julie.

The tall dark man put his newspaper down, found his ticket, and gave it to the guard. The guard looked at it.

'You're all right, sir,' he said. 'The boat doesn't leave Plymouth before six o'clock. You've got lots of time.'

The tall man smiled, put his ticket back in his pocket and opened his newspaper again.

Julie didn't look at him. 'A boat,' she thought. 'He's taking a boat from Plymouth. Where's he going?' She looked at him again with her long green eyes.

He read his newspaper and didn't look at her. But his eyes smiled.

The train stopped at Totnes station and more people got on and off.

'Everybody's going on holiday,' Bill said. He laughed. 'It's going to be wonderful. No work for two weeks. It's a nice, quiet town, St Austell. We can stay in bed in the mornings, and sit and talk in the afternoons, and have a drink or two in the evenings. Eh, Julie?' He looked at his wife. 'Are you all right, Julie?'

'Yes, Bill,' she said quietly. 'I'm OK.' She looked out of the window again. The train went more quickly now, and it began to rain. Bill and the man in the brown hat talked and talked. Bill told a long story about two men and a dog, and the man in the brown hat laughed very loudly.

The man in the brown hat laughed very loudly.

'That's a good story,' he said. 'I like that. You tell it very well. Do you know the story about...' And he told Bill a story about a Frenchman and a bicycle.

'Why do people laugh at these stories?' Julie thought. 'They're so boring!'

But Bill liked it. Then he told a story about an old woman and a cat, and the man in the brown hat laughed again. 'That's good, too. I don't know. How do you remember them all?"

'Because,' Julie thought, 'he tells them every day.'

'I don't understand,' the little girl said suddenly. She looked at Bill. 'Why did the cat die?'

'Shhh. Be quiet,' her mother said. 'Come and eat your sandwiches now.'

'That's all right,' Bill said. 'I like children.'

The man in the brown hat looked at the children's sandwiches. 'Mmm, I'm hungry, too,' he said. 'You can get sandwiches in the restaurant on this train.' He looked at Bill. 'Let's go down to the restaurant, eh? I need a drink too.'

Bill laughed. 'You're right. It's thirsty work, telling stories.'

The two men stood up and left the carriage.

The little girl ate her sandwich and looked at Julie. 'But why did the cat die?' she asked.

'I don't know,' Julie said. 'Perhaps it wanted to die.'

The little girl came and sat next to Julie. 'I like your hair,' she said. 'It's beautiful.' Julie looked down at her and smiled.

For some minutes it was quiet in the carriage. Then the tall dark man opened his bag and took out a book. He put it on the seat next to him, and looked at Julie with a smile. Julie looked back at him, and then down at the book. Famous towns of Italy, she read. Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples. She looked away again, out of the window at the rain. 'Two weeks in St Austell,' she thought. 'With Bill. In the rain.'

Famous towns of Italy, Julie read. Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples.

After half an hour the two men came back to the carriage.'There are a lot of people on this train,' Bill said. 'Do you want a sandwich, Julie?'

'No,' she said. 'I'm not hungry. You eat them.'

The train was nearly at Plymouth. Doors opened and people began to move. 'A lot of people get on here,' the man in the brown hat said.

The tall dark man stood up and put his book and his newspaper in his bag. Then he picked up his bag and left the carriage. The train stopped at the station. A lot of people got on the train, and two women and an old man came into the carriage. They had a lot of bags with them. Bill and the man in the brown hat stood up and helped them. One of the women had a big bag of apples. The bag broke and the apples went all over the carriage.

'Oh damn!' she said.

Everybody laughed, and helped her to find the apples. The train moved away from Plymouth station. After a minute or two everybody sat down and the woman gave some apples to the children.

'Where's Julie?' Bill said suddenly. 'She's not here.'

'Perhaps she went to the restaurant,' the man in the brown hat said.

'But she wasn't hungry,' Bill said. 'She told me.'

The little girl looked at Bill. 'She got off the train at Plymouth,' she said. 'With the tall dark man. I saw them.'

'She got off the train at Plymouth. With the tall dark man.'

'Of course she didn't!' Bill said. 'She's on this train. She didn't get off.'

'Yes, she did,' the children's mother said suddenly. 'I saw her too. The tall man waited for her on the platform.'

'He waited for her?' Bill's mouth was open. 'But... But he read his newspaper all the time. He didn't talk to Julie. And she never talked to him. They didn't say a word.'

'People don't always need words, young man,' the children's mother said.

'But she's my wife!' Bill's face was red and angry. 'She can't do that!' he said loudly. He stood up. 'I'm going to stop the train.' Everybody looked at him and the two children laughed.

'No,' the man in the brown hat said, 'no, you don't want to do that. Sit down and eat your sandwiches, my friend.'

'But I don't understand. Why did she go? What am I going to do?' Bill's face was very unhappy. After a second or two he sat down again. 'What am I going to do?' he said again.

'Nothing,' the man in the brown hat said. He ate his sandwich slowly. 'Go and have your holiday in St Austell. You can have a good time there. Forget about Julie. Those green eyes, now.' He took out a second sandwich and began to eat it. 'I knew a woman once with green eyes. She gave me a very bad time. No, you want to forget about Julie.'

“当然了，”戴棕色帽子的男人说道，“要知道，有好警察，也有坏警察。”

“没错。”年轻男人说道，“是的，确实如此。你说呢，朱莉？”他望着身旁的年轻女人。

朱莉没有回答，她感到无聊，闭上了眼睛。

“朱莉是我的妻子。”年轻男人跟戴棕色帽子的男人说道，“她不喜欢坐火车，她在车上总是感觉不舒服。”

“哦，是吗？”戴棕色帽子的男人回答。“嗳，我妻子——她不喜欢坐巴士。她有一次差点在一辆巴士上发生意外。就是去年……不，不，不是。是两年前。现在我想起来了，是在曼彻斯特。”他讲了一个关于他老婆在曼彻斯特坐巴士的又长又无聊的故事。

那天很热，火车又开得慢。包厢里有七个人——戴棕色帽子的男人，年轻男人和他的妻子朱莉，一个妈妈和两个孩子，还有一个身材高大、皮肤黝黑、穿着昂贵西装的男人。

年轻人名叫比尔。他留着棕色的短发，脸上带着幸福的笑容。他的妻子朱莉有一头红色的长发和碧绿的眼睛——像海水一样的颜色。那是一双非常美丽的眼睛。

戴棕色帽子的男人不停地说着。他有一张红色的大脸，大嗓门。他和比尔聊天，因为比尔也喜欢聊天。戴棕色帽子的男人常常大笑，他笑的时候，比尔也会跟着笑。比尔喜欢和人说说笑笑。

两个孩子又热又无聊。他们不想坐着，想在车厢里来回奔跑、吵吵闹闹。

“坐下来，消停一会儿。”孩子的妈妈说道。她身材娇小，神情和声音都显得疲惫。

“我不想坐着。”小男孩说道，“我渴了。”

“来，吃个橘子。”他妈妈说着从包里拿出一个橘子给他。

“我也想吃橘子。”小女孩大声说道。

“好吧，给你。”妈妈说道，“喏，乖乖地吃。”

两个孩子吃着橘子，安静了一会儿。

没一会儿小男孩说：“我要喝饮料，我口渴。”

那个黝黑的高个子男人拿出报纸看了起来。朱莉睁开眼睛，看着报纸背面的内容。她看了看布达佩斯的天气和利物浦的足球比赛情况。她对布达佩斯不感兴趣，也不喜欢足球，只是不想听比尔和那个戴棕色帽子男人的谈话。“说，说，说。”她心想，“比尔就不会停一下。”

突然，她从报纸的上方看到了高个子男人的眼睛。虽然看不到他的嘴，但是朱莉能感觉到他眼中的笑意。她迅速低头看向报纸，又看了看布达佩斯的天气情况。

火车停在道利什车站。旅客们上上下下，十分嘈杂。

“我们到站了吗？”小女孩问道。她来到窗边，向外望去。

“没有，坐好。”女孩的妈妈说道。

“我们要去彭赞斯，”小女孩告诉比尔，“去度假。”

“是的。”女孩的妈妈说道，“我妹妹在海边有一家小旅馆。我们住在那里会便宜些。”

“没错，”戴棕色帽子的男人说道，“那是个不错的小镇。我认识一个当地人，他在国王街有一家餐厅。很多度假的人都去那里吃饭，他夏天能赚很多钱。”他大声笑着，“没错。”他又说，“在彭赞斯可以度过一个愉快的假期。”

“我们要去圣奥斯特尔，”比尔说道，“我和朱莉。这是我们第一次度假，朱莉想去西班牙，可我喜欢圣奥斯特尔。我经常去那里度假。那里的八月很美。你们在圣奥斯特尔也会玩得愉快的。”

朱莉望着窗外。“布达佩斯到底在哪儿呀？”她心想，“我想去那里。我想去维也纳，想去巴黎，想去罗马，想去雅典。”她绿色的眼眸中透着厌倦和气恼。她透过窗户看着英格兰的小村庄和山丘。

戴棕色帽子的男人看着朱莉。“你说得对，”他对比尔说道，“在英格兰度假可以很愉快。我和太太就经常去布赖顿。不过那儿的天气啊！有一年我们去了，那里每天都在下雨。上午下，下午下，晚上还下。没骗你，雨从没停过。”他大声笑着，“我们去了一个礼拜就差点回家了。”

比尔也笑了起来。“那你们整天都干什么？”他问道。

朱莉第三次看报纸上布达佩斯的天气。后来，她看着高个子男人的手，那是一双修长、黝黑的手，十分干净。“漂亮的手。”她心想。他戴着一块昂贵的日本手表。“日本，”她想，“我想去日本。”她抬起头，再次从报纸上方看到了那个男人的眼睛。这次她没有躲开。绿色的眼睛凝视着深褐色的眼睛，看了足有漫长的一分钟。

过了牛顿阿伯特车站后，列车长来到包厢查票。“那么，”列车长说道，“大家都要去哪儿？”

“火车晚点了。”戴棕色帽子的男人说道，“从我的手表来看，晚了二十分钟。”

“十分钟。”列车长说道，“就晚了十分钟。”他冲着朱莉微笑道。

黝黑的高个子男人放下报纸，找出车票，递给了列车长。列车长看了一眼。

“您的好了，先生。”他说道，“船在六点钟以后才离开普利茅斯，您的时间很充裕。”

高个子男人笑了笑，把车票放回口袋，又翻开了报纸。

朱莉没有看他。“船，”她心里想着，“他到普利茅斯坐船要去哪里？”她那双细长的碧眼盯着他。

男人只管读着报纸，并没看朱莉。但是他的眼睛却含着笑意。

火车停在托特尼斯车站，上下车的人更多了。

“大家都要去度假。”比尔笑道，“真是太好了！两周都不用工作。圣奥斯特尔是一个安静怡人的小城。我们早上可以睡懒觉，下午坐着聊聊天，晚上小喝两杯。是吧，朱莉？”他看着妻子，“你没事吧，朱莉？”

“没事，比尔。”朱莉平静地说道，“我很好。”她又看着窗外。火车跑得更快了，外面下起雨来。比尔和戴棕色帽子的男人继续聊着。比尔讲了一个很长的故事，内容是关于两个男人和一只狗的，戴棕色帽子的男人哈哈大笑起来。

“这故事不错，”他说道，“我喜欢。你讲得很好。你知不知道那个关于……”他给比尔讲了一个法国男人和一辆自行车的故事。

“为什么还会有人觉得这种故事好笑？”朱莉心里想，“它们太无聊了！”

但是比尔喜欢。接着比尔讲了一个老太太和一只猫的故事。戴棕色帽子的男子又笑了起来。“这个故事也好，我很好奇，你是怎么记住这些故事的？”

“因为，”朱莉心想，“他每天都讲。”

“我不明白，”小女孩突然说，她看着比尔，“猫为什么死了呢？”

“嘘！别乱插嘴。”她妈妈说道，“过来吃三明治吧。”

“没关系。”比尔说道，“我喜欢孩子。”

戴棕色帽子的男人看着孩子们的三明治。“嗯，我也饿了。”他说，“餐车上可以买到三明治。”他看着比尔说：“我们一起去餐车，如何？我还想喝点东西。”

比尔笑着说：“你说的没错，讲故事容易嘴巴干。”

两个男人起身离开了包厢。

小女孩吃着三明治，看着朱莉。“可是猫为什么死了呢？”她问。

“我不知道，”朱莉说道，“也许它想死吧。”

小女孩来到朱莉身边坐下。“我喜欢你的头发，”她说道，“很漂亮。”朱莉低头看着她笑了。

有几分钟，包厢里静静的。那个黝黑的高个子男人打开包，拿出一本书。他把书放在身边的座位上，微笑地看着朱莉。朱莉也看着他，然后低头看那本书。意大利名城，她读着。威尼斯，佛罗伦萨，罗马，那不勒斯。她又转过头去看着车窗外面的雨。“在圣奥斯特尔待两周。”她心里想，“和比尔，还是雨天。”

半小时后，两个男人回到包厢。“火车上人好多。”比尔说道，“你要吃三明治吗，朱莉？”

“不用了。”朱莉说，“我不饿，你吃吧。”

火车马上要到普利茅斯了。包厢门打开后，人们走动了起来。“很多人在这一站上车。”戴棕色帽子的男人说道。

黝黑的高个子男人站起身，把书和报纸放进包里，然后拎起包离开了包厢。火车进站停下了。很多人上了车，两个女人和一个老先生走进包厢。他们大包小包拎了好多。比尔和戴棕色帽子的男人站起来帮他们。其中一个女人带了一大包苹果。包坏了，苹果掉了一地。

“唉，该死！”女人说道。

大家都笑着帮她捡苹果。火车离开了普利茅斯车站。一两分钟后，大家都坐了下来。那个女人给了孩子几个苹果。

“朱莉呢？”比尔突然说，“她不见了。”

“可能她去餐车那儿了。”戴着棕色帽子的男人说道。

“可她不饿呀。”比尔说道，“她跟我说的。”

“小女孩看着比尔。“她在普利茅斯下车了，”她说，“和那个黝黑的高个子男人一起下车的。我看见他们了。”

“不可能。”比尔说道，“她在火车上，她没有下车。”

“她确实下车了。”孩子的妈妈突然说道，“我也看见她了。高个子男人在站台上等着她。”

“他在等她？”比尔张大了嘴，“可是……可是他一直在看报纸，他没有和朱莉说过话，朱莉也没和他说话。他们一句话都没说过。”

“人有时不需要通过语言也能交流的，年轻人。”孩子的妈妈说道。

“可她是我的妻子。”比尔的脸气得通红。“她不能这么做。”他大声说着并站起身来。“我要让火车停下。”大家都看着他，两个孩子笑了起来。

“别。”戴棕色帽子的男人说道，“别，你不用这样。坐下来吃你的三明治，朋友。”

“可我不明白。她为什么要走？我怎么办？”比尔满脸沮丧。不一会儿他又坐下来。“我该怎么办？”他又嘟囔了一遍。

“什么也不做。”戴棕色帽子的男人说道，他慢悠悠地吃着三明治。“去圣奥斯特尔度假。你可以在那里过得很开心。行了，忘掉朱莉，忘掉那双碧眼吧。”他又拿出一个三明治吃了起来，“我曾经认识一个碧眼女人。她让我吃了很多苦头。不，你应该忘掉朱莉。”





I never stay in one country for a long time. It gets boring. I like to move on, see new places, meet different people. It's a good life, most of the time. When I need money, I get a job. I can do most things – hotel and restaurant work, building work, picking fruit. In Europe you can pick fruit most of the year. You need to be in the right country at the right time, of course. It's not easy work, but the money's not bad.

I like to go south in the winter. Life is easier in the sun, and northern Europe can get very cold in the winter. Last year, 1989 it was, I was in Venice for October. I did some work in a hotel for three weeks, then I began slowly to move south. I always go by train when I can. I like trains. You can walk about on a train, and you meet a lot of people.

I left Venice and went on to Trieste. There I got a cheap ticket for the slow train to Sofia, in Bulgaria. This train goes all down through Yugoslavia, and takes a long time – a day and a half. But that didn't matter to me.

The train left Trieste at nine o'clock on a Thursday morning. There weren't many people on it at first, but at Zagreb more people got on. Two girls went along the corridor, past my carriage. They looked through the door, but they didn't come in. Then an old woman came in, sat down and went to sleep. The two girls came back along the corridor and looked into the carriage again. The train left Zagreb and I looked out of the window for about ten minutes, then I went to sleep too.

After the train left Zagreb, I went to sleep.

When I opened my eyes again, the two girls were in the carriage, they looked friendly, so I said, 'Hullo.'

'Hi!' they said.

'You're American,' I said. 'Or Canadian. Right?'

'American,' the taller girl said. She smiled. 'And you're twenty-three, your name's Tom Walsh, you've got blue eyes, and your mum lives in Burnham-on-Sea, UK. Right?'

'How did you know all that?' I asked.

The second girl laughed. 'She looked at your passport. It's in your coat pocket.'

'Oh. Right.' My coat was on the seat next to me. I took my passport out of my pocket and put it back in my bag. 'Who are you, then?' I asked.

They told me. Melanie and Carol from Los Angeles, USA. They liked Europe, they said. They knew a lot of places – Britain, Holland, Denmark, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece...

'I'm going to Bulgaria now,' I said. 'For about a month. Then I'm going south for the winter. Cyprus, or perhaps North Africa.'

'Oh yes?' they said. 'We love Bulgaria. Sofia's a great town. Wonderful.'

'What do you do about money?' I asked.

'Well, you know,' Carol smiled. 'Sometimes we get a little job. This and that. But what about you?'

'Yeah, come on,' Melanie said. 'Tell us about you – Tom Walsh with the blue eyes and the mum in Burnham-on-Sea. What are you doing with your life, hey?'

So I told them. They were nice girls. They were older than me, perhaps twenty-seven or twenty-eight, but I liked them. We talked and laughed for hours. I told them a lot of stories about my life. Some of the stories were true, some weren't. But the girls laughed, and said I was a great guy. I asked them about Bulgaria, because I didn't know the country. They knew Sofia well, they said.

We talked and laughed for hours.

'Hey, Carol,' Melanie said. 'We're staying in Bela Palanka for a day or two. But let's go over to Sofia this weekend and meet Tom there. We can meet him on Saturday night at the Hotel Marmara.'

'Yeah! It's a good hotel,' Carol told me. 'Cheap, but good. What do you think, Tom?'

'Great!' I said. 'Let's do that.'

The train was very slow. We got to Belgrade at six o'clock in the evening, and a lot of people got off. There were only me and the girls in the carriage then. The guard came and looked at our tickets, and went away again.

Carol looked at Melanie. 'Hey, Mel,' she said. 'Why don't you and Tom go along to the restaurant? I'm not hungry, and I want to sleep for an hour.'

'Er... Food's very expensive on the train,' I said. 'I haven't got much money just now. I'm going to get a job in Sofia.'

'Oh Tom!' Melanie said. 'Why didn't you tell us? Look, you're a nice guy, right? We're OK for money this week. We can buy you a meal.'

'Of course we can,' Carol said. 'And look, in Sofia, we can take you to the best restaurant in town. It's a great place. We love it.'

What could I say? I was hungry. They had money, I didn't. So Melanie and I went to the restaurant and had a meal. When we came back, Carol was still alone in the carriage. Melanie put her feet on the seat and went to sleep.

At Nis some more people got on the train, and two old men came into out carriage. They looked at Melanie's feet on the seat, and talked in loud voices. Carol laughed, and Melanie opened her eyes and sat up.

'Are we nearly there?' she asked Carol, and looked out of the window.

'Yeah. About half an hour, I think.'

'Why are you getting off at Bela Planka?' I asked. 'What are you going to do there?'

Melanie smiled. 'Find a cheap hotel, meet people, take a look at the town... you know.'

'Just for a day or two,' Carol said.

'But there's nothing there!'

'Oh well, you never know,' Melanie laughed. 'See you in Sofia, right? On Saturday night.'

'The Hotel Marmara, OK? Eight o'clock,' Carol said. 'Don't forget now!'

'Ok. Great,' I said. 'See you there.'

The train came into Bela Palanka and stopped. The two girls got off and stood on the platform. They smiled at me through the window. 'Saturday. Eight o'clock,' Melanie shouted.

'Saturday. Eight o'clock,' Melanie shouted.

'OK,' I called. They couldn't hear me because of the noise in the station. They smiled again, picked up their bags and walked away. Nice girls. I'm going to have a great time in Sofia, I thought.

The train left Yugoslavia and crossed into Bulgaria at two o'clock in the morning. Then the train stopped at some village – I don't remember the name. I ate an apple and looked out of the window.

Suddenly there were a lot of policemen on the train. Everybody in the carriage sat up and began to talk.

'What's happening?' I said in Italian to the old man next to me.

'I don't know,' he said in bad Italian. 'Perhaps they're looking for somebody. Look. The police are taking some people off the train.'

Then two policemen came into our carriage, a tall thin one and a short fat one. They looked at everybody carefully... and then they looked at me again.

'Come with us, please,' the fat policeman said in English.

'What? Me?' I said. 'Why? What's the matter?'

'And bring your bag with you,' the tall policeman said.

I began to ask a question, but policemen never like questions from young men with long hair. So I stayed quiet, picked up my bag, and went with them.

In the station building there were a lot more policemen, and some people from the train. They were all young people, I saw. Some were afraid, some were bored. The police looked in everybody's bags, and then the people went back to the train.

My two policemen took me to a table. 'Your passport, please,' the fat policeman said, 'and open your bag.'

They looked at my passport and I opened my bag. There was a young policewoman with red hair at the next table. She had a nice face, so I smiled at her and she smiled back.

'Aaah!' the tall policeman said suddenly. All my dirty shirts and clothes were out on the table. The policeman picked up my bag and turned it over. On to the table, out of my bag, fell packet after packet of US American dollars. Nice, new dollars. Fifty-dollar notes in big packets. A lot of money.

Nice, new dollars. Fifty-dollar notes in big packets. A lot of money.

My mouth opened and stayed open. I couldn't find my voice. I was suddenly a very interesting person, and a lot of police ran up to our table and stood behind me.

'50,000... 100,000... 150,000... There's 200,000 dollars here,' the tall policeman said. 'What an interesting bag, Mr Tom Walsh!'

I found my voice again quickly. 'But it's not my bag!' I shouted.

There was a big, happy smile on that policeman's face. 'Well,' he said, 'it's got your name on it. Look!'

So I looked, and of course there was my name, and yes of course, it was my bag. So how did 200,000 US dollars get into my bag?

'You cannot bring US dollars into this country,' the fat policeman said. He had very short grey hair and little black eyes. He didn't smile once.

'But I didn't bring them,' I said quickly. 'They're not my dollars. I never saw them before in my life, and—'

There was a lot of noise in the station. I looked out of the window and saw my train. Slowly, it began to move.

'Hey!' I shouted. 'That's my train—'

'Hey!' I shouted. 'That's my train —'

The tall policeman laughed. It was a great day for him. 'Oh no,' he said. 'You're not getting back on that train. You're staying here with us, in our beautiful country.' He smiled, happily.

So I never got to Sofia on Saturday. I was very unhappy about that. I wanted to have a little talk with Melanie and Carol, ask them one or two questions, you know. You're a nice guy, Tom. See you in Sofia, OK? Take you to the best restaurant in town . Yeah. Great.

And I never got down to Cyprus or North Africa that winter. Oh well, I live and learn. It's not an easy life, in prison. But it's warm in winter, and the food's not bad. And I'm meeting some interesting people. There's a man from Georgia, USSR – Boris, his name is. He comes from a place by the Black Sea. He's a great guy. When we get out of here, he and I are going down to Australia... Brisbane perhaps, or Sydney. Get a job on a ship, start a new life. Yeah, next year's going to be OK.

去南方过冬


我从不会在一个国家待很长时间，因为日子久了会让人觉得无聊。我喜欢四处走，去看看新的地方，结识不同的人。这样的生活很不错，至少多数时候是这样的。我需要钱时，就找份工作。我会做很多工作——酒店和餐厅的工作，建筑工作，采摘水果。在欧洲，一年中大部分时间都能采摘水果。当然，你需要在对的时间去到对的国家。采摘水果这种活儿并不轻松，但报酬不错。

我喜欢去南方过冬。生活在阳光下更舒服，而北欧的冬天会特别冷。去年，也就是1989年，我十月份是在威尼斯度过的。我在一家酒店里干了三周的活儿，然后开始慢慢往南走。如果可以的话，我通常会坐火车。我喜欢火车。你可以在火车上四处走动，结识很多人。

我离开威尼斯去了的里雅斯特。在那里我买到一张去保加利亚索非亚的便宜慢车车票。火车一路南行穿越南斯拉夫，要花很长时间——一天半。但这对我来说无所谓。

火车在一个星期四的早晨九点钟离开了的里雅斯特。起初车上没有多少人，但是在萨格勒布有很多人上了车。两个女孩沿着过道往前走，路过我的包厢。她们往门里看了看，但没进来。接着一个老妇人走进来，坐下后就睡着了。那两个女孩沿着过道走了回来，再次朝包厢里看了看。火车离开了萨格勒布，我向窗外望了大约十分钟，后来也睡着了。

当我再睁开眼时，那两个女孩已经在包厢里了。她们看起来很友好，于是我说：“你们好。”

“你好！”她们说道。

“你们是美国人，”我说道，“或者是加拿大人，对吧？”

“美国人。”高个子女孩说道，她笑了笑，“你23岁，你的名字是汤姆·沃尔什，你有一双蓝眼睛，你妈妈住在英国的滨海伯纳姆，对吗？”

“这些你是怎么知道的？”我问道。

另一个女孩笑了起来：“她看了你的护照。你的护照在大衣口袋里。”

“哦，是的。”我的外套就放在身边的座位上。我把护照从口袋里拿出来，放回包里。

“那么，你们是谁呢？”我问道。

她们自称梅拉妮和卡萝尔，来自美国洛杉矶。她们说她们喜欢欧洲。她们去过很多地方——英国、荷兰、丹麦、德国、法国、西班牙、意大利、南斯拉夫、保加利亚、希腊……

“我要去保加利亚，”我说，“大概待上一个月，然后去南方过冬，到塞浦路斯，也可能是北非。”

“哦，真的吗？”她们说道，“我们喜欢保加利亚，索非亚是一个美丽的城市。很棒。”

“你们靠什么挣钱？”我问道。

“这个，”卡萝尔笑了笑，“有时我们会找个小活儿，各种活儿。那你呢？”

“是呀，快来说说。”梅拉妮说道，“跟我们说说你和你妈的事——蓝眼睛的汤姆·沃尔什和住在滨海伯纳姆的妈妈。你们是怎么生活的，啊？”

于是我告诉了她们。她们是很好的女孩。比我大些，可能二十七八岁，但我喜欢她们。我们有说有笑地聊了好几个小时。我给她们讲了许多我自己的事。有些是真的，有些不是。但是她们笑了，说我是个很棒的人。我问她们保加利亚的情况，因为我对这个国家并不了解。她们说她们对索非亚很熟悉。

“喂，卡萝尔。”梅拉妮说道，“我们要在贝拉帕兰卡待上一两天，不妨这周末我们去索非亚找汤姆。我们可以周六晚上和他在马尔马拉宾馆见面。”

“是啊！那是家不错的宾馆。”卡萝尔跟我说，“便宜，但很好。你觉得怎么样，汤姆？”

“太好了！”我说，“就这么办。”

火车开得十分缓慢。我们在晚上六点钟到了贝尔格莱德，很多人在那儿下车。包厢里就只剩下了我和那两个女孩。列车长过来查票，查完又走了。

卡萝尔看着梅拉妮。“嗨，梅尔。”卡萝尔说道，“为什么你不和汤姆一起去餐车呢？我不饿，想睡一个小时。”

“哦……火车上用餐很贵的。”我说，眼下我没有太多钱。我打算去索非亚找份工作。”

“啊，汤姆！”梅拉妮说道，“你怎么不告诉我们？听我说，你是一个好人，对吗？我们这周的钱足够了，可以请你吃一顿。”

“当然可以。”卡萝尔说道，“瞧，在索非亚我们可以带你去城里最好的餐馆。那是个很不错的地方，我们很喜欢那里。”

我能说什么呢？我饿了。她们有钱，我没有。于是我和梅拉妮去餐车吃了顿饭。我们回来后，卡萝尔依然一个人在包厢里。梅拉妮把脚放到座位上，睡着了。

在尼什，又有一些人上了车，有两个老先生来到了我们的包厢。他们看了看座位上梅拉妮的脚，便大声说起话来。卡萝尔笑了，梅拉妮睁开眼睛坐了起来。

“我们快到了吗？”她问卡萝尔，然后望着窗外。

“是的。大概还有半个小时，我觉得。”

“为什么你们要在贝拉帕兰卡下车？”我问道，“你们去那里干什么？”

梅拉妮笑了笑：“找一家便宜的宾馆，接触一些人，看一看这个城市……你懂的。”

“也就一两天。”卡萝尔说道。

“可那里什么都没有。”

“好吧，也说不定。”梅拉妮笑了起来，索非亚见，好吗？周六晚上。”

“马尔马拉宾馆，行吗？八点。”卡萝尔说道，“哎，别忘了！”

“好的，太棒了。”我说，“不见不散。”

火车驶入贝拉帕兰卡停下了。那两个女孩下了车，站在月台上。她们隔窗向我微笑着。“周六，八点。”梅拉妮大声说道。

“好的。”我喊道。因为车站里太吵，她们听不到我说的话。她们再次向我微笑，拎起背包，转身走了。多好的女孩。我想我将会在索非亚度过一段愉快的时光。

火车离开南斯拉夫，在凌晨两点钟驶入保加利亚。后来火车经停了某个小镇——我没记住名字。我吃了个苹果，看着窗外。

突然火车上出现了很多警察。包厢里的所有人都坐直身子，议论起来。

“发生什么事了？”我用意大利语问身旁的老先生。

“我不知道。”他的意大利语很差，“可能他们在找人。瞧，警察把一些人带下了火车。”

接着，有两个警察走进我们的包厢，他们俩一个又高又瘦，一个又矮又胖。他们仔细看着每一个人……后来又看向我。

“请跟我们来。”胖警察用英语说道。

“什么？我？”我问，“为什么？怎么了？”

“带上你的包。”高个子警察说道。

我开始问问题，但是警察一向讨厌长头发的年轻人提出的问题。因此我保持沉默，带上我的包和他们一起下了车。

在车站大楼里有更多的警察，还有一些从火车上下来的人。我看到他们都是年轻人。有些人看起来很害怕，有些人看着很无聊。警察查看了每个人的包，之后，人们回到火车上。

“那两个警察把我带到一张桌子前。请出示你的护照。”胖警察说道，“打开你的包。”

他们查看了我的护照，我打开包。邻桌有一个红头发的年轻女警察。她长得不错，所以我冲她笑了笑，她也冲我笑了笑。

“啊！”高个子警察突然说道。我所有的脏衬衫和衣服都倒在了桌子上。警察拿起我的包，把它翻了过来。从我包里掉出了成捆的美元，落到桌子上。崭新的美元。一大堆面值五十美元的钞票。好多钱。

我张大嘴，呆住了。我说不出话来。我突然间成了一个令人关注的人物，许多警察跑到我们这一桌来，站在我身后。

“五万……十万……十五万……一共有二十万美元。”高个子警察说道，“多耐人寻味的包呀，汤姆·沃尔什先生！”

很快我回过神来。“可是这不是我的包！”我大喊道。

警察脸上挂着灿烂愉快的笑容。“哎呀，”他说，“这上边有你的名字，瞧！”

于是我看了看，上边确实有我的名字，而那个真的是我的包。可是那二十万美元是怎么跑进我包里的呢？

“你不能携带美元来这个国家。”胖警察说道。他留着灰白的短发，长着小小的黑眼睛。他一次也没笑过。

“可这不是我带的。”我赶忙说道，“这不是我的美元。我从没见过，并且……”

车站很吵。我向窗外望去，看到了我坐的那趟火车。慢慢地，车开动了。

“嘿！”我喊道，“那是我的火车——”

高个子警察笑了。对他而言，今天是很重要的一天。“啊，不。”他说道，“你回不到那趟火车上了，你得和我们待在这里，待在我们这个美丽的国家。”他开心地笑了起来。

结果我没能在周六到达索非亚，为此我非常不开心。你知道，我想跟梅拉妮和卡萝尔谈一谈，问她们一两个问题。你是一个善良的人 ，汤姆 。索非亚见 ，好吗 ？带你去城里最好的餐馆 。是呀。我真是太好了。

那年冬天我也没有去成塞浦路斯或北非。好吧，吃一堑，长一智。监狱的日子并不好过。不过那里的冬天挺暖和，饭菜也不是很难吃。而且我也结交了一些有意思的人。有个男人来自苏联的格鲁吉亚，名字叫鲍里斯。他来自黑海边的一个地方，他是一个不错的人。我们出去以后，打算南下去澳大利亚……可能去布里斯班或者悉尼。在船上找份工作，开始新的生活。是的！明年会好起来的。





Mr Harris liked trains. He was afraid of aeroplanes, and didn't like buses. But trains – they were big and noisy and exciting. When he was a boy of ten, he liked trains. Now he was a man of fifty, and he still liked trains.

So he was a happy man on the night of the 14th of September. He was on the night train from Helsinki to Oulu in Finland, and he had ten hours in front of him.

'I've got a book and my newspaper,' he thought. 'And there's a good restaurant on the train. And then I've got two weeks' holiday with my Finnish friends in Oulu.'

There weren't many people on the train, and nobody came into Mr Harris's carriage. He was happy about that. Most people on the train slept through the night, but Mr Harris liked to look out of the window, and to read and think.

After dinner in the restaurant Mr Harris came back to his carriage, and sat in his seat next to the window. For an hour or two he watched the trees and lakes of Finland out of the window. Then it began to get dark, so he opened his book and began to read.

At midnight the train stopped at the small station of Otava. Mr Harris looked out of the window, but he saw nobody. The train moved away from the station, into the black night again. Then the door of Mr Harris's carriage opened, and two people came in. A young man and a young woman.

The young woman was angry. She closed the door and shouted at the man: 'Carl! You can't do this to me!' The young man laughed loudly and sat down.

The young man laughed loudly and sat down.

Mr Harris was a small, quiet man. He wore quiet clothes, and he had a quiet voice. He did not like noisy people and loud voices. So he was not pleased. 'Young people are always noisy,' he thought. 'Why can't they talk quietly?'

He put his book down and closed his eyes. But he could not sleep because the two young people didn't stop talking.

The young woman sat down and said in a quieter voice: 'Carl, you're my brother and I love you, but please listen to me. You can't take my diamond necklace. Give it back to me now. Please!'

Carl smiled. 'No, Elena,' he said. 'I'm going back to Russia soon, and I'm taking your diamonds with me.' He took off his hat and put it on the seat. 'Elena, listen. You have a rich husband, but I – I have no money. I have nothing! How can I live without money? You can't give me money, so I need your diamonds, little sister.'

Mr Harris looked at the young woman. She was small, with black hair and dark eyes. Her face was white and afraid. Mr Harris began to feel sorry for Elena. She and her brother didn't look at him once. 'Can't they see me?' he thought.

'Carl,' Elena said. Her voice was very quiet now, and Mr Harris listened carefully. 'You came to dinner at our house tonight, and you went to my room and took my diamond necklace. How could you do that to me? My husband gave the diamonds to me. They were his mother's diamonds before that. He's going to be very, very angry – and I'm afraid of him.'

Her brother laughed. He put his hand in his pocket, then took it out again and opened it slowly. The diamond necklace in his hand was very beautiful. Mr Harris stared at it. For a minute or two nobody moved and it was quiet in the carriage. There was only the noise of the train, and it went quickly on through the dark cold night.

The diamond necklace in Carl's hand was very beautiful.

Mr Harris opened his book again, but he didn't read it. He watched Carl's face, with its hungry eyes and its cold smile.

'What beautiful, beautiful diamonds!' Carl said. 'I can get a lot of money for these.'

'Give them back to me, Carl,' Elena whispered. 'My husband's going to kill me. You're my brother... Please help me. Please!'

Carl laughed again, and Mr Harris wanted to hit him. 'Go home, little sister,' Carl said. 'I'm not going to give the diamonds back to you. Go home to your angry husband.'

Suddenly there was a knife in the young woman's hand. A long, bright knife. Mr Harris watched with his mouth open. He couldn't speak or move.

'Give the diamonds back to me!' Elena cried. 'Or I'm going to kill you!' Her hand on the knife was white.

Carl laughed and laughed. 'What a sister!' he said. 'What a kind, sweet sister! No, they're my diamonds now. Put your knife away, little sister.'

But the knife in the white hand moved quickly: up, then down. There was a long, terrible cry, and Carl's body fell slowly on to the seat. The colour of the seat began to change to red, and the diamond necklace fell from Carl's hand on to the floor.

There was a long, terrible cry, and Carl's body fell slowly on to the seat.

Elena's face was white. 'Oh no!' she whispered. 'Carl! Come back... come back! I didn't want to kill you!' But Carl didn't answer, and the red blood ran slowly over the floor. Elena put her head in her hands, and again in the carriage there was a long, terrible cry.

Mr Harris's face was white too. He opened his mouth, but he couldn't speak. He stood up, and carefully moved to the door. The young woman was quiet now. She didn't move or look up at Mr Harris.

In the corridor, Mr Harris ran. The guard was at the back of the train and Mr Harris got there in half a minute.

'Quickly!' Mr Harris said. 'Come quickly! An accident... a young woman... oh dear! Her brother is... is dead!'

The guard ran with Mr Harris back to the carriage. Mr Harris opened the door and they went inside.

The guard ran with Mr Harris back to the carriage.

There was no dead body of a young man. There was no young woman... no blood, no knife, no diamond necklace. Only Mr Harris's bags and his hat and coat.

The guard looked at Mr Harris, and Mr Harris looked at him.

'But... ' Mr Harris began. 'But they were here! I saw them! She... the young woman... She had a knife and she... she killed her brother.'

'A knife, you say?' the guard asked.

'Yes,' Mr Harris said quickly. 'A long knife, and her brother took her diamonds, so she—'

'Ah! Diamonds!' the guard said. 'Was the young woman's name Elena?' he asked.

'Yes, it was!' Mr Harris said. 'How do you know that? Do you... Do you know her?'

'Yes – and no,' the guard said slowly. He thought for a minute, then looked at Mr Harris. 'Elena di Saronelli,' he said. 'She had dark eyes and black hair. Very beautiful. She was half-Italian, half-Finnish. He brother was a half-brother. They had the same father, but his mother was Russian, I think.'

'Was? Had?' Mr Harris stared at the guard. 'But she... Elena... she's alive! And where is she?'

'Oh no,' said the guard. 'Elena di Saronelli died about eighty years ago. After she killed her brother with a knife, she jumped off the train, and died at once. It was near here, I think.' He looked out of the window, into the night.

Mr Harris's face was very white again. 'Eighty years ago!' he whispered. 'What are you saying? Were she and her brother... But I saw them!'

'Yes, that's right,' the guard said. 'You saw them, but they're not alive. They're ghosts. They often come on the night train at this time in September. I never see them, but somebody saw them last year. A man and his wife. They were very unhappy about it. But what can I do? I can't stop Elena and Carl coming on the train.'

The guard looked at Mr Harris's white face. 'You need a drink,' he said. 'Come and have a vodka with me.'

Mr Harris didn't usually drink vodka, but he felt afraid. When he closed his eyes, he could see again Elena's long knife and could hear her terrible cry. So he went with the guard to the back of the train.

After the vodka, Mr Harris felt better. He didn't want to sleep, and the guard was happy to talk. So Mr Harris stayed with the guard and didn't go back to his carriage.

'Yes,' the guard said, 'it's a famous story. I don't remember it all. It happened a long time ago, of course. Elena's father was a famous man here in Finland. He was very rich once, but he had three or four wives and about eight children. And he liked the good things of life. So there wasn't much money for the children. Carl, the oldest son, was a bad man, people say. He wanted an easy life, and money in his hand all the time.'

'Yes,' the guard said, 'it's a famous story.'

The train hurried on to Oulu through the black night, and the guard drank some more vodka. 'Now, Elena,' he said.'She didn't have an easy life with those three difficult men – her father, her brother, her husband. One year she visited her mother's family in Italy, and there she met her husband, di Saronelli. He was rich, but he wasn't a kind man. They came back to Finland, and Carl often visited their house. He wanted money from his sister's rich husband. Elena loved her brother, and gave him some money. But di Saronelli didn't like Carl and was angry with Elena. He stopped giving her money, and after that... well, you know the story now.'

'Yes,' Mr Harris said. 'Poor, unhappy Elena.'

Mr Harris stayed with his friends in Oulu for two weeks. They were quiet weeks, and Mr Harris had a good holiday. But he took the bus back to Helsinki. The bus was slow, and there were a lot of people on it, but Mr Harris was very happy. He didn't want to take the night train across Finland again.

哈里斯先生和夜车


*此故事属于非现实题材小说

哈里斯先生喜欢坐火车。他害怕坐飞机，也不喜欢坐巴士。但是火车——空间又大又喧闹，很令人兴奋。他十岁时就喜欢坐火车，现在他已经五十了，依旧喜欢坐火车。

所以，在九月十四日那天晚上，他很开心。他在芬兰乘坐由赫尔辛基去奥卢的夜车，要在车上待十个小时。

“我带了一本书和报纸。”他心里想，“火车上还有个不错的餐厅。接下来我要和芬兰的朋友在奥卢度过两周的假期。”

火车上人不太多，所以没人来到哈里斯先生的包厢，他为此很高兴。多数人晚上坐火车都会在车上睡觉，而哈里斯先生喜欢看着窗外、看书和思考。

在餐厅吃完晚饭后，哈里斯先生回到自己的包厢，坐在靠窗的座位上。大概有一两个小时，他一直望着窗外芬兰的树木和湖泊。后来，天色渐暗，他打开书，读了起来。

午夜时分，火车停在了一个叫奥塔瓦的小车站。哈里斯先生往窗外看去，但一个人也没有看到。火车驶离车站，再度进入了茫茫黑夜。后来，哈里斯先生包厢的门开了，进来了两个人——一个年轻的男人和一个年轻的女人。

年轻的女人很生气。她关上门冲着那个男人嚷道：“卡尔！你不能这么对我！”年轻的男人哈哈大笑着坐了下来。

哈里斯先生是一个身材矮小、安静的人。他衣着朴素，说话声音很小。他不喜欢吵闹的人和大嗓门，因此他不太高兴。“年轻人总是很吵。”他心里想，“为什么他们说话不能小点儿声？”

他放下书，闭上眼睛。但是他睡不着，因为那两个年轻人在不停地争吵。

年轻的女人坐了下来，稍微降低了声音说：“卡尔，你是我的哥哥，我爱你，但是请听我说。你不能拿走我的钻石项链。快还给我，求你了！”

卡尔笑了。“不，埃琳娜。”他说，“我很快要回俄罗斯了，我要带上你的钻石。”他摘下帽子，放在座位上。“埃琳娜，听着。你有一个有钱的丈夫，但是我 ——我没钱。我什么都没有！没有钱我怎么生活？你不能给我钱，所以我需要你的钻石，小妹。”

哈里斯先生看着这个年轻的女人。她身材娇小，长着乌黑的头发和深色的眼睛。她脸色苍白，充满恐惧。哈里斯先生开始为埃琳娜感到难过。埃琳娜和她哥哥一眼也没看哈里斯先生。“他们看不见我吗？”他心想。

“卡尔。”埃琳娜说道。此刻她的声音非常平静，哈里斯先生仔细听着。“你今晚来我家吃饭，并且到我的房间拿走了我的钻石项链。你怎么能这么对我？这些钻石是我丈夫给我的。以前这些钻石都是他妈妈的。他肯定会非常非常生气——我很怕他。”

她哥哥笑了。他把手放进自己的口袋里，然后又拿了出来并慢慢摊开手掌。他手里的钻石项链特别漂亮。哈里斯先生盯着项链。足有一两分钟大家都没动，车厢里很安静。只有火车奔跑的声音，火车在漆黑寒冷的夜晚急速行驶。

哈里斯先生又打开书，但是他并没有读。他看着卡尔的脸——饥渴的眼神和冷酷的笑容。

“多漂亮的钻石！漂亮啊！”卡尔说道，“卖掉它们，我就能有很多钱。”

“还给我，卡尔。”埃琳娜低声说，“我丈夫会杀了我的。你是我的哥哥……请帮帮我。求你了！”

卡尔又笑起来，哈里斯先生真想揍他。“回家吧，妹妹。”卡尔说道，“我不会把这些钻石还给你的。回家吧！回到你愤怒的丈夫身边去吧！”

突然，年轻的女人拿出一把刀，那把刀长长的，寒光闪闪。哈里斯先生看到这一幕，吓得张大嘴。他说不出话来，也动弹不了。

“把钻石还给我！”埃琳娜哭喊着，“要不我杀了你！”她持刀的手没有血色。

卡尔大笑不已。“瞧我的妹妹！”他说，多么善良、温柔的妹妹呀！不。钻石现在是我的了。把你的刀拿开，妹妹。”

但是那只苍白的手握着的刀先是上晃，再猛地捅了上去。伴随着一声长长的可怕的叫声，卡尔的身体慢慢倒在了座位上。座椅被染成了红色，那条钻石项链也从卡尔的手里滑落到了地板上。

埃琳娜脸色惨白。“啊，不！”她低声说，“卡尔！别死……别死！我本不想杀你。”但是卡尔没有反应，红色的鲜血慢慢地流淌到地板上。埃琳娜抱着头，车厢里再次响起一声长长的可怕的叫声。

哈里斯先生也吓得脸色惨白。他张着嘴，但是说不出话来。他站起身来，小心翼翼地挪动到门口。年轻的女人此刻静了下来。她没有动，也没有抬头看哈里斯先生。

哈里斯先生在过道里奔跑着。列车长在火车尾部，哈里斯先生只用了半分钟就跑了过去。

“快！”哈里斯先生说道，“快来！出事了……一个年轻的女人……天哪！她的哥哥死……死了。”

列车长和哈里斯先生一起跑回包厢。哈里斯先生打开门，他们走了进去。

没有年轻男人的尸体，也没有年轻女人的身影……没有鲜血，没有刀子，没有钻石项链。只有哈里斯先生的包以及他的帽子和外套。

列车长和哈里斯先生面面相觑。

“可是……”哈里斯先生开口道，“可是他们刚才在这儿！我看到他们了。她……那个年轻的女人……她拿着一把刀，她……她杀死了她的哥哥。”

“你说一把刀？”列车长问道。

“是的。”哈里斯先生赶忙说，“一把长长的刀，她的哥哥拿了她的钻石，所以她……”

“啊！钻石！”列车长询问道，“年轻的女人是不是叫埃琳娜？”

“是的！”哈里斯先生说道，“你是怎么知道的？你……你认识她？”

“认识——也不算认识。”列车长缓慢地说道。他想了一会儿，然后看着哈里斯先生。“埃琳娜·迪萨罗奈利，”他说道，“她很漂亮——深色的眼睛和黑色的头发。她有一半意大利血统，一半芬兰血统。她曾有个同父异母的哥哥。他们有同一个爸爸，但是我觉得她哥哥的 妈妈是俄罗斯人。”

“过去？曾经？”哈里斯先生盯着列车长，“可是她……埃琳娜……她还活着！她在哪里？”

“啊，不！”列车长说道，“埃琳娜·迪萨罗奈利大约在八十年前死了。她用刀杀死哥哥之后，就跳下火车，当场死亡。我想就在这附近。”他看着窗外的茫茫黑夜。

哈里斯先生的脸再次变得惨白。“八十年前。”他嘀咕着，“你在说什么？难道她和她哥哥……但是我看到他们了！”

“是的，没错。”列车长说道，“你看到了他们，但是他们不是大活人，他们是鬼魂。他们经常在九月的这个时候到夜车上来。我 从来没看见过他们，不过去年有人见过。一个男人和他的妻子，他们因此非常不满。但是我能做什么呢？我阻止不了埃琳娜和她哥哥上火车。”

列车长看着哈里斯先生惨白的脸。“你得喝杯酒，”他说道，“来跟我一起喝杯伏特加。”

哈里斯先生不常喝伏特加，但是他感到害怕。闭上眼睛的时候，他又能看到埃琳娜的长刀，能听到她可怕的叫声。于是，他跟随列车长一起返回火车的车尾。

喝完伏特加后，哈里斯先生感觉好了些。他不想睡觉，而列车长又很愿意和他聊天。所以哈里斯先生和列车长待在一起，没有回到他的包厢。

“是的，”列车长说道，“这是个很有名的故事，我都记不太全了。当然这故事发生在很久以前了。埃琳娜的爸爸在芬兰这儿是个名人。他曾经很富有，但是他有三四个老婆，大概八个孩子。而且他喜欢享受生活，所以没有多少钱给孩子们。大家都说卡尔这个大儿子是个混球儿，他贪图安逸，总希望手里有花不完的钱。”

火车在黑夜中急匆匆地开向奥卢，列车长又喝了点儿伏特加。“至于埃琳娜，”他说，“她没过过好日子，因为那三个难相处的男人——爸爸、哥哥和丈夫。有一年她去意大利探望娘家的人，在那里结识了她的丈夫——迪萨罗奈利。他人很富有，但没有一点儿同情心。他们回到芬兰，卡尔经常去他们家。他想从富有的妹夫那里要些钱。埃琳娜很爱她的哥哥，所以给了他一些钱。但是迪萨罗奈利不喜欢卡尔，他很生埃琳娜的气。他不再给埃琳娜钱，之后……哦，你现在知道故事的结局了。”

“是的。”哈里斯先生说道，“可怜又不幸的埃琳娜。”

哈里斯先生和他的朋友在奥卢待了两周。那是平静的两周，哈里斯先生假期过得很愉快。不过他选择坐巴士回赫尔辛基。巴士很慢，人又多，不过哈里斯先生很开心。他再也不想在芬兰坐夜班火车了。

内容简介


故事发生在十九世纪末，闻名世界的大侦探歇洛克·福尔摩斯住在伦敦贝克街221B号。伦敦这座恢宏帝都阴雨连绵，雾气弥漫，警方在抓捕罪犯方面常常束手无策。幸亏有福尔摩斯假以援手，不过案子也得足够有趣才能吸引他参与。

福尔摩斯足智多谋，但聪明人经常对朋友没什么耐心。“动动脑子，华生！”他会这样不客气地跟那位优秀的医生说话。尽管华生医生没他聪明，反应也不如他快，可有时候他也需要华生医生帮忙，而且他对华生的帮助也心怀感激，尤其是在情势危险的时候。

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE

It is the end of the nineteenth century, and Sherlock Holmes, the world-famous detective, lives at 221B Baker Street in London. The great capital is a rainy, foggy city, where the police often have difficulty in catching criminals. Luckily, Holmes is there to help them, but only if a case is interesting enough.

Holmes is extremely intelligent, and intelligent people are often impatient with their friends. 'Think, Watson!' he says sharply to the good doctor, who is not as clever or as quick as he is. But he sometimes needs Dr Watson's help, and is grateful for it, especially in a dangerous situation.

SCENE 1

An interesting advertisement

The inside of Wilson's shop. It's a little shop, with a lot of clocks, pictures, watches, etc. Wilson is writing at a table. Vincent Spaulding is looking at The Morning Chronicle newspaper.

SPAULDING

This is interesting.

WILSON

What is?

SPAULDING

This advertisement. It is interesting for you , Mr Wilson, because you have red hair.

WILSON

(Look at Spaulding ) Go on.

SPAULDING

The Red-Headed League want to find someone new. Do you know about them? Listen. (Reading from newspaper ) 'To all red-headed men, twenty-one years old or more – the Red-Headed League can now take a new man. We pay four pounds a week to do easy work. Come to the League offices at 7, Pope's Court, Fleet Street, London on Monday at 11 o'clock.' (To Wilson ) You can get two hundred pounds a year!

'Do you know about them?'

WILSON

Really? Tell me more about it.

SPAULDING

A rich American with red hair began the League. When he died, he gave a lot of his money to the Red-Headed League, to give easy work to men with red hair. It's very good wages for only a little work. Why don't you go along to Pope's Court?

WILSON

But millions of red-headed men will go, and—

SPAULDING

Not millions. You need to live in London.

WILSON

I don't know...

SPAULDING

And you must have very red hair. You have very red hair, Mr Wilson.

WILSON

Monday... eleven o'clock...?

SPAULDING

It's Monday today. And it's nearly eleven o'clock! Come on!

SCENE 2

Some easy work for Wilson

The office at Pope's Court – a room with only a table and two chairs. Duncan Ross, a man with very red hair, is sitting behind the table. We can hear the noise of a lot of people out in the street.

ROSS

Next!

The door opens and Spaulding and Wilson come in. Ross looks at Wilson and gets excited.

SPAULDING

This is Mr Jabez Wilson, and he wants to be in the League. (Ross gets up and walks past the table to meet them. )

ROSS

And he has a good head of hair. I can't remember when I saw a better head! (He suddenly puts out a hand and pulls Wilson's hair .)

WILSON

Aaghh! Stop it!

ROSS

I'm sorry, but we must be careful. Of course it is your hair. I can see that now. Please sit down.

Ross sits in the chair behind the table again.

Wilson sits in the other chair. Spaulding stands behind him.

ROSS

My name is Duncan Ross. Have you got a wife, Mr Wilson? And children?

WILSON

No, I have no wife and no family.

ROSS

Oh dear! Some of the men in our League have lots of red-headed children. We like that.

WILSON

I'm sorry, but I—

ROSS

It's all right. You have that wonderful head of hair. When can you begin work here?

WILSON

It's not easy. I have a shop, and—

SPAULDING

I can stay in the shop, Mr Wilson.

WILSON

What hours must I work?

ROSS

Ten o'clock to two o'clock.

WILSON

And the wage?

ROSS

Four pounds a week.

WILSON

What must I do?

ROSS

You must work here, in the office, all the time. That is very important. You cannot go out between the hours of ten o'clock and two o'clock.

WILSON

And the work?

Ross suddenly pulls Wilson's hair.

ROSS

You must copy from this large book, and you must bring paper and a pen. Can you begin tomorrow?

WILSON

Yes, I can.

ROSS

(Smiling ) Then goodbye, Mr Jabez Wilson.

Wilson and Spaulding leave the office.

SCENE 3

Wilson tells his story

Sherlock Holmes's room. Holmes and Wilson are sitting in chairs. Holmes is smoking his pipe. Wilson has The Morning Chronicle in his hands.

HOLMES

Most interesting, Mr Wilson. Most interesting.

The door opens and Watson comes in.

WATSON

Holmes, I'm sorry! I didn't know—

HOLMES

Come in, my dear Watson! This is Mr Jabez Wilson. He is telling me a very strange story. (To Wilson ) This is Doctor Watson. He's a good friend. Give him the advertisement to read.

Wilson gives the newspaper to Watson.

HOLMES

He does a lot of writing, Watson. Do you see?

WILSON

Oh! How did you know that, Mr Holmes?

HOLMES

The right arm of your coat is different from the left. Your arm is on the table when you write.

WILSON

(Laughing ) Yes, that's right!

WATSON

(Finishes reading and looks at Holmes. ) It's very strange, Holmes.

HOLMES

(Looking excited ) It is strange, isn't it? Do you see the day and month of the newspaper?

WATSON

It's the Morning Chronicle of 27th April, 1890. Two months ago.

HOLMES

Now, Mr Wilson, tell us about your shop.

WILSON

It's in Saxe-Coburg Square, Mr Homes. It's a little shop, and it doesn't make much money.

HOLMES

Does somebody help you in the shop?

WILSON

Yes, a young man. Well, he's not very young, but he works for half-wages.

HOLMES

Does he! What's his name?

WILSON

Vincent Spaulding. He's very good at his work. He likes to take photographs when he's not working. And he makes the pictures in my dark cellar. But he works well when he's in the shop.

HOLMES

How did you first see the newspaper advertisement? Tell us that.

WILSON

Spaulding saw it, eight weeks ago, and we went to Pope's Court and saw Mr Duncan Ross. I told you about the visit a few minutes ago...

'Most interesting, Mr Wilson.'

'He makes the pictures in my dark cellar.'

HOLMES

Yes, yes. And I can tell Watson about it later. What happened next?

WILSON

Well, I was very pleased, Mr Holmes. I went home feeling very happy. But that evening I began to think again. 'Copying from a book is strange work for a man to do,' I thought.

WATSON

Very strange, yes.

WILSON

But the next morning I went to Pope's Court with my pen and some paper. Mr Ross was there, but he soon went away, and I began my work.

HOLMES

Well?

WILSON

I went in every morning at ten o'clock, and went home at two. And on Saturday, Ross was in the office again, and gave me my four pounds.

HOLMES

How long did you work there?

WILSON

Eight weeks. But today I went to the office at ten o'clock, and the door was locked. (He takes a paper from his coat and gives it to Holmes. ) This was on the door.

HOLMES

(Reading ) 'The Red-Headed League is finished. June 23rd, 1890.' Then what did you do?

WILSON

I went to the office in the next building, and I asked the man, 'What happened to the Red-Headed League?' 'Who are they?' he asked. 'Who is the man at number 7?' I asked. 'The man with the red hair?' he said. 'His name is William Morris. He moved out yesterday. He has new offices at 17 King Edward Street.' Well, I went to King Edward Street, Mr Holmes.

HOLMES

You did not find a Mr William Morris or a Mr Duncan Ross. Am I right?

WILSON

You are!

HOLMES

What did you do then?

WILSON

I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square.

HOLMES

What does Spaulding say about all this?

WILSON

He says, 'Wait for a letter. You're going to hear something.'

HOLMES

What do you think?

WILSON

I need your help, I think.

HOLMES

You are right, Mr Wilson. I am happy to help you. But first I want to ask you one or two questions. Mr Spaulding was the first to see the advertisement. Yes?

WILSON

Yes.

HOLMES

When did he begin to work for you?

WILSON

About three months ago.

HOLMES

How did he come?

WILSON

He answered an advertisement in the newspaper.

HOLMES

Was he the only man to answer it?

WILSON

No, twelve people answered it.

HOLMES

Why did you take him?

WILSON

Because he was cheap.

HOLMES

He is happy to work for half the usual wages.

WILSON

Yes.

HOLMES

Tell me about him, this Vincent Spaulding.

WILSON

He's small, and a good, quick worker. He's about thirty years old, I think.

HOLMES

Where is he now?

WILSON

He's at the shop.

HOLMES

That is all, Mr Wilson. Today is Saturday. I am going to have an answer for you before Monday.

WILSON

Thank you, Mr Holmes.

Watson goes out with Wilson. Holmes walks up and down, thinking. A minute later, Watson comes back.

HOLMES

We must work quickly, Watson. Put on your hat. We're going to Saxe-Coburg Square.

SCENE 4

Holmes meets Spaulding

Outside the shop in Saxe-Coburg Square. Holmes is walking up and down. Now and then he hits the ground outside the shop with his walking stick. Then he hits the door of the shop. Spaulding opens the shop door and looks out. The legs of his trousers are dirty.

SPAULDING

Can I help you?

HOLMES

Yes. How can I get to the Strand?

SPAULDING

Third on the right, and fourth on the left.

He gets back into the shop and closes the door.

HOLMES

He's a clever young man, Watson.

WATSON

He is? Why did you ask about the Strand? You know London very well! You wanted to see him.

Holmes hits the ground outside the shop with his walking stick.

HOLMES

Not him. His trousers.

WATSON

His trousers? I don't understand. And why did you hit the ground with your stick?

HOLMES

My dear Doctor, this is not the time for talking. I must go and look at the roads behind Saxe-Coburg Square. Are you going to your work?

WATSON

Yes, I must go to the hospital.

HOLMES

I have things to do too. But I want your help tonight. Come at 10 o'clock. And Watson—

WATSON

Yes, Holmes?

HOLMES

Bring your gun.

SCENE 5

To catch a thief

Sherlock Holmes's room. Holmes, Jones and Merryweather are talking quietly. Watson comes in.

HOLMES

Watson, you know Mr Jones of Scotland Yard. And this is Mr Merryweather. They're coming with us tonight.

JONES

Hello, Doctor. We meet again. I'm here because I want to catch John Clay. He's a killer and a thief, one of the worst men in London. It isn't going to be easy to catch him, because he's very clever.

'He's a killer and a thief.'

HOLMES

It's after ten o'clock. We must go.

They all leave the room.

SCENE 6

Watching and waiting

Inside the bank strong-room. There are boxes on the floor. It is dark. The door opens and Holmes comes in, carrying a light. Watson, Jones and Merryweather come after him. Holmes looks carefully at the floor. Merryweather sits on a box and hits the floor with his foot.

MERRYWEATHER

How do you know—?

HOLMES

Please, no noise! Perhaps they can hear us!

JONES

How long before—?

HOLMES

An hour. They are going to wait for Mr Wilson to go to bed, then work quickly, I think. (To Watson ) We're in the strong-room of the First Bank. Did you know that? Mr Merryweather works for the bank. Tell Watson, Mr Merryweather. What do the thieves want?

MERRYWEATHER

Our gold. It's in all these boxes. Lots and lots of it!

WATSON

Gold!

HOLMES

We must wait in the dark. Get behind the boxes, everyone. Things are going to happen in the next hour, I think. When I hear or see anything strange, I'm going to come out quickly with a light, and then you must help me. Be ready with your gun, Watson. Is everything ready upstairs, Mr Jones?

JONES

My men are waiting at the front door of the bank, Holmes. They can't get out there.

HOLMES

Good. Now we must be quiet and wait.

He puts out the light. The strong-room is dark, but we can see the men waiting behind the boxes. Nothing happens. Watson looks at his watch.

WATSON

(Quietly ) It's 11.15, Holmes. When—?

HOLMES

Sahh!

They are all quiet for nearly a minute. Then we see a light coming through the floor. Suddenly the ground opens. First a hand with a gun comes out, and then Spaulding puts his other hand out. We watch him and Ross come out.

SPAULDING

(To Ross ) Now, have you got—?

With his light, Holmes comes out from behind his box, and catches Spaulding.

SPAULDING

What—!

Ross quickly gets back into the tunnel. Jones wants to stop him, but he cannot. Holmes hits Spaulding's arm. Now the gun is on the ground.

HOLMES

You can't get away, John Clay!

SPAULDING

No. But my friend—

HOLMES

There are three men waiting for him at the front door of the bank.

SPAULDING

You think of everything, Mr Holmes. You're very clever.

Holmes comes out from behind his box...

HOLMES

Your Red-Headed League was clever, too. But I am pleased to catch the famous John Clay!

SCENE 7

Holmes and Watson

Sherlock Holmes's room. Holmes and Watson are sitting in chairs. Holmes is smoking his pipe.

HOLMES

They needed the Red-Headed League to get Mr Wilson out of his shop. Do you understand that?

WATSON

Yes. I think – er – yes.

HOLMES

They wanted Wilson away from the shop for some hours every day. But how could they do it? Then Clay saw the colour of Ross's hair – and thought of a 'Red-Headed League'! When Wilson answered their newspaper advertisement, he went to work in their office every day. Then they had time to make their tunnel. Very clever!

WATSON

So Spaulding is John Clay, the famous thief. When did you first know that?

HOLMES

Spaulding was happy to work for half-wages. 'Why?' I thought. Spaulding often went down to the cellar. 'What's he doing down there?' I thought. Suddenly, I thought about tunnels! 'Is Spaulding making a tunnel?' I thought. 'To another building?' Watson, you saw me hitting the ground with my stick, outside the shop.

... and catches Spaulding.

WATSON

Yes... now I understand. Was the cellar in front of the shop? You wanted to know that.

HOLMES

Yes, I did. And it wasn't. The cellar was behind the shop. Then I saw the man 'Spaulding'. Did you see his trousers?

WATSON

Er – yes, I saw them.

HOLMES

They were dirty, Watson! Why? Because making a tunnel is dirty work!

WATSON

Very clever, Holmes!

HOLMES

Then I went into the next street, at the back of the shop. And what did I see? The First Bank!

WATSON

The bank, yes! Of course.

HOLMES

'Why is that young man making a tunnel?' I thought. 'To get into the bank strong-room!'

WATSON

But why tonight? How did you know—?

HOLMES

Because they closed the offices of the Red-Headed League. 'The tunnel must be ready,' I thought. And Saturday is a good day. The bank does not open on Sunday. Two days for the thieves to get away.

WATSON

(Laughing ) But they didn't get away, Holmes. You're very clever.

HOLMES

(Not laughing ) That's very true, Watson.

一则有趣的广告

威尔逊的店铺里。这是家小店铺，摆着钟表、绘画和手表之类的东西。威尔逊正坐在桌前写东西。文森特·斯波尔丁在看《纪事晨报》。

斯波尔丁：

这个有点儿意思。

威尔逊：

是什么？

斯波尔丁：

这则广告。威尔逊先生您 应该会对广告感兴趣，因为您长着红头发。

威尔逊：

（看着斯波尔丁） 说下去。

斯波尔丁：

红发会在征寻新会员。你听说过这家协会吗？听着啊。（念报纸） “致所有年满二十一岁的红发男性——红发会目前欲征觅新会员一人。周薪四镑，工作轻松。有意者请于周一上午十一点前往伦敦舰队街波普斯巷7号红发会办公室应征。”（对威尔逊说） 你一年可以挣二百镑呢！

威尔逊：

真的吗？给我讲讲这家协会的事。

斯波尔丁：

美国一个红头发阔佬创建了这个协会。他去世时留了很多钱给红发会，用于向红头发的男人提供轻松的工作。给的钱很多，要做的事却很少。你干吗不去波普斯巷试试呢？

威尔逊：

可是肯定得有几百万红头发的男人去吧，而且——

门开了，斯波尔丁和威尔逊走了进来。罗斯看了威尔逊一眼，一下子兴奋起来。

斯波尔丁：

这位是杰贝兹·威尔逊先生，他想加入贵协会。（罗斯站起来，走过桌子迎接他们。）

罗斯：

他的头发可真不错。我还真没见过这么漂亮的红头发呢！（他突然伸出一只手揪住了威尔逊的头发。）

威尔逊：

啊——！住手！

罗斯：

很抱歉，但是我们必须得谨慎从事。这确实是您自己的头发，我现在可以确定了。请坐。

罗斯重新坐回桌子后面。

威尔逊坐在另一把椅子上，斯波尔丁站在他身后。

罗斯：

罗斯：

没关系。你有一头漂亮的头发。你什么时候可以来这儿上班？

威尔逊：

斯波尔丁：

我可以留在店里照应，威尔逊先生。

威尔逊：

我的上班时间是怎样的呢？

罗斯：

威尔逊：

罗斯：

你必须来这里上班，一直待在办公室里。这很重要。上午十点到下午两点之间你不可以溜号儿。

威尔逊：

工作内容呢？

罗斯：

你要照着这本厚厚的书抄写，还要自己带纸和笔来。你明天能开始上班吗？

威尔逊：

是的，可以。

罗斯：

（微笑着） 那么再见吧，杰贝兹·威尔逊先生。

威尔逊和斯波尔丁离开了办公室。

第三场

威尔逊自述

歇洛克·福尔摩斯的房间。福尔摩斯和威尔逊坐在椅子上。福尔摩斯抽着烟斗，威尔逊手上拿着《纪事晨报》。

福尔摩斯：

非常有意思，威尔逊先生。非常有意思。

门开了，华生走了进来。

华生：

福尔摩斯，不好意思！我不知道——

福尔摩斯：

进来吧，亲爱的华生！这位是杰贝兹·威尔逊先生。他正跟我讲一个奇特的故事。（对威尔逊） 这位是华生医生，我的好朋友。把那则广告给他看看。

威尔逊把报纸递给了华生。

福尔摩斯：

他做了不少抄写的工作，华生。你看出来了吗？

威尔逊：

啊！您怎么知道的，福尔摩斯先生？

福尔摩斯：

你大衣右边的袖子跟左边的不一样。你写字的时候胳膊是放在桌子上的呀。

威尔逊：

（大笑） 是啊，正是这样！

华生：

（读完报纸，看着福尔摩斯） 这非常奇怪啊，福尔摩斯。

福尔摩斯：

（看起来很兴奋） 确实 奇怪，是吧？你留意报纸的日期了吗？

华生：

这是1890年4月27日的《纪事晨报》。两个月以前的。

福尔摩斯：

那么，威尔逊先生，给我们讲讲你店里的情况吧。

威尔逊：

我的店在萨克森-科堡广场，福尔摩斯先生。店不大，也不怎么挣钱。

福尔摩斯：

店里有什么帮手吗？

威尔逊：

有，是一个小伙子。噢，他其实也不太年轻了，不过他只要一半的薪水。

福尔摩斯：

是吗！他叫什么名字？

威尔逊：

文森特·斯波尔丁。他活儿干得不错。不干活儿的时候他喜欢拍照片。他在我那黑咕隆咚的地窖里冲洗照片。不过，他在店里上班的时候表现都很好。

福尔摩斯：

你最先是怎么看到报上的广告的？跟我们说说。

威尔逊：

是斯波尔丁看到的，就在八个星期之前，后来我们就去波普斯巷见了邓肯·罗斯先生。刚才我跟您讲了见面的情况……

福尔摩斯：

是的，是的，我稍后告诉华生。后来又发生了什么？

威尔逊：

哦，我当时非常开心，福尔摩斯先生。我满心欢喜地回了家。可是那天晚上我回头重新琢磨了这件事。“对一个男人来说，抄书实在是一份古怪的工作。”我心想。

华生：

确实非常奇怪，没错。

威尔逊：

但是第二天我还是带着纸笔去了波普斯巷。罗斯先生在那儿，但他不久就离开了，我便开始干我的活儿。

福尔摩斯：

后来呢？

威尔逊：

我每天早上十点去，下午两点回家。到了周六，罗斯又回到办公室来，付给我四英镑。

福尔摩斯：

你在那里工作了多久？

威尔逊：

八个星期。但是今天上午十点我去办公室的时候，门上了锁。（他从大衣里掏出一张纸递给福尔摩斯。） 这个贴在门上。

福尔摩斯：

（念） “红发会业已解散。1890年6月23日。”后来你做了什么呢？

威尔逊：

我去了隔壁大楼的办公室，问那里的人：“红发会出了什么事？”“谁是红发会？”“7号房间的那个人是谁？”我问。“那个红头发的男人吗？”他说，“他叫威廉·莫里斯，昨天搬走了。他在爱德华国王大街17号有新的办公室了。”于是，我就去了爱德华国王大街，福尔摩斯先生。

福尔摩斯：

你既没有找到威廉·莫里斯先生，也没有找到邓肯·罗斯先生。我说得对吗？

威尔逊：

说得没错！

福尔摩斯：

后来你又做了什么呢？

威尔逊：

我回到萨克森-科堡广场的家。

福尔摩斯：

斯波尔丁怎么评价这事？

威尔逊：

他说：“等等看有没有信来。您会听到消息的。”

福尔摩斯：

你怎么想呢？

威尔逊：

我觉得我需要您帮帮我。

福尔摩斯：

说得对，威尔逊先生。我很乐意帮你。但是我得先问你一两个问题。是斯波尔丁最先看到广告的，对吧？

威尔逊：

对。

福尔摩斯：

他是什么时候开始为你工作的呢？

威尔逊：

大概三个月前。

福尔摩斯：

他是怎么来的？

威尔逊：

他是看到我在报纸上登的广告后来应征的。

福尔摩斯：

只有他一个来应征吗？

威尔逊：

不是，有十二个人来。

福尔摩斯：

你为什么选他呢？

威尔逊：

因为他要价便宜。

福尔摩斯：

他乐意只拿一半的工资。

威尔逊：

是的。

福尔摩斯：

跟我说说这个文森特·斯波尔丁吧。

威尔逊：

他个子不大，干活不错，手脚麻利。我觉得他大概有三十岁上下。

福尔摩斯：

他现在在哪儿呢？

威尔逊：

在店里。

福尔摩斯：

我问完了，威尔逊先生。今天是周六，我周一之前应该能给你一个答复。

威尔逊：

谢谢您，福尔摩斯先生。

华生陪威尔逊走了出去。福尔摩斯踱来踱去，陷入深思。没一会儿，华生回来了。

福尔摩斯：

我们得赶快行动，华生。戴上帽子，我们去萨克森-科堡广场。

第四场

福尔摩斯见到了斯波尔丁

萨克森-科堡广场的店铺外，福尔摩斯走来走去，不时用手杖敲打店铺外的地面。之后他敲了敲店门。斯波尔丁打开门向外张望，他的裤腿脏了。

斯波尔丁：

有事吗？

福尔摩斯：

哦，请问到斯特兰德大街怎么走？

斯波尔丁：

第三个路口右转，然后第四个路口左转。

他回到店里关上了门。

福尔摩斯：

他是个聪明的年轻人，华生。

华生：

是吗？你为什么要问斯特兰德大街怎么走呢？你对伦敦很熟悉呀！你是想见见他吧。

福尔摩斯：

不是见他，是看看他的裤子。

华生：

裤子？我不明白。还有，你为什么要用手杖敲打地面呢？

福尔摩斯：

我亲爱的医生，现在不是聊天的时候。我得去看看萨克森-科堡广场后面的街道。你要去工作了吗？

华生：

是的，我得去医院了。

福尔摩斯：

我也有事要去忙了。不过今晚我需要你帮忙，十点来吧。对了，华生——

华生：

什么事，福尔摩斯？

福尔摩斯：

带上你的枪来。

第五场

抓贼

歇洛克·福尔摩斯的房间。福尔摩斯、琼斯和梅里韦瑟正小声交谈。华生进来了。

福尔摩斯：

华生，你认识苏格兰场的琼斯先生吧。这位是梅里韦瑟先生。他们今晚要跟我们一起行动。

琼斯：

你好，医生，又见面了。我今天来是为了抓约翰·克莱，他是杀人犯，又是窃贼，算得上伦敦最坏的人之一。要抓住他可不容易，这家伙很聪明。

福尔摩斯：

十点多了，我们得动手了。

他们一起离开了房间。

第六场

静观其变

银行的保险库里，地上堆着些箱子，光线昏暗。门开了，福尔摩斯提着一盏灯走进来，华生、琼斯和梅里韦瑟跟在身后。福尔摩斯仔细地察看地面，梅里韦瑟坐在一个箱子上用脚敲打着地面。

梅里韦瑟：

您怎么知道——

福尔摩斯：

请别出声！他们可能会听到我们说话！

琼斯：

还要多久才——

福尔摩斯：

一个小时。我想，他们得等到威尔逊先生上床睡觉以后才会迅速动手。（对华生） 现在我们在第一银行的保险库里。你之前知道吗？梅里韦瑟先生在这家银行工作。告诉华生，梅里韦瑟先生，这些窃贼想偷什么？

梅里韦瑟：

我们的金子。所有的箱子里都是——大把大把的金子。

华生：

金子！

福尔摩斯：

我们必须在黑暗中等待。大家藏到那些箱子后面去，我估计一个小时内就会出现情况了。一旦我听到或者发现什么异常的状况，就会拿着灯迅速冲出去，接下来你们必须给我帮把手。把枪准备好，华生。楼上一切就绪了吗，琼斯先生？

琼斯：

我的手下在银行前门守着呢，福尔摩斯。他们不可能从那里逃出去。

福尔摩斯：

好。现在我们必须安静地等待。

福尔摩斯把灯熄灭。保险库里一片昏暗，但是箱子后面躲着的人依稀可见。什么动静也没有。华生看了看手表。

华生：

（小声地说） 十一点一刻了，福尔摩斯。什么时候——

福尔摩斯：

嘘！

他们安静了不到一分钟，一道光就从地下透出来。突然，地板翻开了。先是伸出来一只拿枪的手，接着斯波尔丁把另外一只手也伸出来。他和罗斯爬了出来。

斯波尔丁：

（对罗斯） 哎，你有——

福尔摩斯提着灯从藏身的箱子后面跳出来抓住了斯波尔丁。

斯波尔丁：

什么——！

罗斯飞快地逃回地道。琼斯试图阻拦他，却没能成功。福尔摩斯击打斯波尔丁的手臂，把枪打落到了地上。

福尔摩斯：

你跑不了的，约翰·克莱！

斯波尔丁：

我是跑不了，可我的朋友——

福尔摩斯：

银行前门有三个人等着他呢。

斯波尔丁：

你把一切都考虑到了，福尔摩斯先生。你非常有头脑。

福尔摩斯：

你那红发会的主意也很高明。不过，能抓住大名鼎鼎的约翰·克莱我很高兴！

第七场

福尔摩斯和华生

歇洛克·福尔摩斯的房间。福尔摩斯和华生坐在椅子上，福尔摩斯抽着烟斗。

福尔摩斯：

他们需要利用红发会让威尔逊先生离开店铺。你明白了吧？

华生：

是的，我想——哦——是的。

福尔摩斯：

他们希望威尔逊先生每天都能离开店铺几个小时，但是他们怎么才能做到呢？这时克莱注意到罗斯的发色——于是想出了“红发会”这个主意！威尔逊应征了他们在报上登的广告后，每天都去他们的办公室上班，这样他们就有时间挖地道了。真是聪明啊！

华生：

那么斯波尔丁就是大盗约翰·克莱啦。你最早什么时候知道这个的？

福尔摩斯：

斯波尔丁愿意拿一半的薪水干活儿。“为什么呢？”我想。斯波尔丁经常到地窖去。“他在那儿干什么呢？”我想。突然，我想到了地道！“斯波尔丁是不是在挖地道呢？”我想，“挖到另外一座建筑物里去？”华生，你看到我用手杖敲打店铺外面的地面来着。

华生：

是的……现在我明白了。地窖是在店铺的前面吗？你是想弄清楚这一点吧。

福尔摩斯：

是的。地窖并不在前面，而是在店铺后面 。然后我见到了“斯波尔丁”其人。你注意到他的裤子了吗？

华生：

嗯——是的，我注意到了。

福尔摩斯：

裤子脏兮兮的，华生！为什么？因为挖地道就是个脏活儿啊！

华生：

真聪明啊，福尔摩斯！

福尔摩斯：

然后我去了店铺后面的那条街。我看到了什么呢？第一银行！

华生：

银行，是啊！那当然了。

福尔摩斯：

那个年轻人为什么要挖地道？”我想，“是为了进入银行的保险库！”

华生：

可为什么就在今晚呢？你怎么知道——？

福尔摩斯：

因为他们把红发会的办公室给关了。“地道一定是挖好了。”我想。而且周六是个好日子，银行周日不营业，有两天时间让这些贼逃跑。

华生：

（大笑） 可他们没跑成啊，福尔摩斯。你真是聪明！

福尔摩斯：

（没有笑） 这是句大实话，华生。

SCENE 1

Hilton Soames's story

Sherlock Holmes is sitting at a table, writing. It is evening. Watson comes in with Hilton Soames.

HOLMES

(Not looking up ) Who was at the door, Watson?

WATSON

This is Mr Hilton Soames, Holmes. He teaches at St Luke's College. (Holmes looks up. )

SOAMES

Can you give me some of your time, Mr Holmes? Today something happened at the college, and I was very worried. Then I thought, 'The famous detective, Sherlock Holmes, is visiting our town. Perhaps he can help!' And I—

HOLMES

I have a lot of work to do, Mr Soames. Perhaps the police—

SOAMES

No, no, I can't go to the police!

HOLMES

Well, tell me your story, Mr Soames.

Watson sits down, but Soames stays standing.

SOAMES

Tomorrow is the first day of an important examination, and I'm one of the examiners. Today, at three o'clock, the three exam papers arrived for me to read. Of course, every student would like to see these papers before the exam!

HOLMES

(Laughing ) Of course!

SOAMES

We are always very careful with them. I began to read them, but at 4.30 p.m. I went out to have tea in a friend's rooms.

HOLMES

Where did you leave the papers?

SOAMES

They were on my writing table. I locked my door, and was away for an hour. When I arrived home, I saw a key in my door. 'Is it my key?' I thought.'No, that's in my pocket. Ah, it's Bannister's key.' Bannister is my servant.

WATSON

Why did he go to your room this afternoon?

SOAMES

He brings my tea in every afternoon.

HOLMES

But you were at your friend's rooms. Did he forget that?

SOAMES

Yes. And so his key was in my door. He is usually careful, but—

HOLMES

Tell me about the examination papers. Where were they when you went back to your room?

SOAMES

One was on a small table next to the window, one was on the floor, and one on my writing table.

HOLMES

(Suddenly looking interested ) The first paper on the floor, the second in the window, and the third on the writing table.

SOAMES

(Opening his mouth suddenly ) Yes! How did you know that?

HOLMES

(Smiling ) Please, tell us more of your very interesting story, Mr Soames.

SOAMES

First, I thought, 'Did Bannister look at the papers?' So I asked him, but he said, 'No, I did not.' And he is an honest man, Mr Holmes.

'When I arrived home, I saw a key in my door.'

HOLMES

What happened next?

SOAMES

Bannister suddenly began to feel ill when I told him about the papers. He sat down on a chair and I gave him a strong drink. Then I looked carefully at the table next to the window.

WATSON

What did you find?

SOAMES

Small pieces of pencil.

HOLMES

Did somebody break and sharpen a pencil?

SOAMES

Yes, perhaps. Yes, that was it.

HOLMES

Good! That helps us!

SOAMES

Two more things. I have a new writing table, but now there's a little cut on it. And there was a piece of black mud on the table.

HOLMES

Is that all?

SOAMES

Yes. Please, help me. Mr Holmes!

Holmes gets up and begins to put on his coat. Watson gets his coat and puts it on too.

HOLMES

It's an interesting story, Mr Soames. Tell me, did any student visit you in your room after the papers arrived this afternoon?

SOAMES

Yes, Daulat Ras, a student from India.

HOLMES

And the papers were on your writing table?

SOAMES

Yes, but he couldn't read them. He was two or three meters away.

HOLMES

But they were exam papers. Could he see that?

SOAMES

Perhaps.

HOLMES

The examination papers were in your room. Did anyone know that? Did Bannister know that?

'There's a little cut on my new writing table.'

SOAMES

No, nobody.

HOLMES

Where is Bannister now?

SOAMES

When I ran out, to find you, Mr Holmes, he was on the chair in my room. He looked very ill.

HOLMES

Did you leave your door open?

SOAMES

Yes, but I locked the papers up first.

HOLMES

Come, then. We must go to your rooms.

The three men leave the room.

SCENE 2

Holmes visits the college

Soames, Holmes and Watson come into Soames's living room. Holmes walks to the window and looks out.

SOAMES

That window does not open, Mr Holmes. Nobody can enter the room through there.

Holmes smiles but says nothing for a minute.

HOLMES

Your servant isn't here now. Perhaps he's feeling better. Which chair did you leave him on?

SOAMES

The chair by the window.

HOLMES

Near this little table, yes? (He thinks for a minute. ) Yes – yes, of course. The man comes in. He takes the three papers from the writing table to carry them across to the window, because... because then he can see you when you come across the garden to the front door, Soames!

SOAMES

But he didn't see me, because I walked in through the back door.

HOLMES

Ah, that helps! Can I see the three papers now?

Soames opens a box with a key and takes out the papers. Watson moves near Holmes to get a look.

HOLMES

(Looking at the first paper ) He carries this first paper across to the table near the window and begins to copy it. It takes him – ten minutes?

WATSON

Fifteen, I think.

HOLMES

All right, fifteen. Then he puts it down on the floor, gets the next paper, and begins to copy that. Then he hears you coming in the back door, Mr Soames. He must be quick! He leaves the second paper on the table next to the window, and runs – where? Did you hear him running upstairs?

SOAMES

No, I didn't.

HOLMES

(Looking closely at the table ) He's writing quickly, because he breaks his pencil and needs to sharpen it again. This is interesting. The pencil was long, and dark blue. Look at these pieces. And do you see the gold letter 'NN'? It's at the end of a word. Do you know Johann Faber pencils?

WATSON

I do, Holmes. I write with them.

Holmes walks across to the big writing table and takes the small piece of black mud from it.

'Can I see the three papers now?'

HOLMES

This is the piece of black mud? (He looks closely

at the writing table. ) I can see the cut. (He looks across at the door. ) What is that door?

SOAMES

It opens into my bedroom.

HOLMES

Did you go into your bedroom before you ran out to find me?

SOAMES

No.

Holmes opens the bedroom door, and looks under the bed. Then he sees the curtain.

HOLMES

A man can hide behind this curtain.

He pulls the curtain back quickly. Behind it are Soames's coats and suits. Then Holmes sees something on the floor, under the curtain.

HOLMES

What's this? It's some mud again. Your visitor was in this room, Mr Soames.

SOAMES

But – why?

HOLMES

Think for a minute. He hears you coming. What can he do? He must hide! So he runs into your bedroom and hides behind this curtain.

SOAMES

Oh! Then he was in here when Bannister and I were in the next room!

HOLMES

Yes, that's right. Tell me, how many students live upstairs and go past your door?

SOAMES

Three, all taking this examination.

HOLMES

Who are they?

SOAMES

There is Gilchrist. He plays football, and likes running. His father was Sir Jabez Gilchrist. He was a rich man, but he gambled his money away. Young Gilchrist hadn't much money, but he works hard.

'Do you see the gold letter "NN" ?'

HOLMES

And the Indian student?

SOAMES

Yes, Daulat Ras is a quiet young man, but he works well. Then there is Miles McLaren, a very clever young man. But he doesn't study much and he's worried about this examination.

HOLMES

So he would like to see the papers first.

SOAMES

Well... yes, perhaps.

HOLMES

Can we speak to Bannister, your servant?

SCENE 3

Some questions for Bannister

In Soames's living room. Holmes, Watson and Soames are sitting in chairs. Holmes is sitting at the writing table. Bannister is standing in front of him.

HOLMES

Your key was in the door of this room today, Bannister. Is that right?

BANNISTER

Yes, sir. I don't usually leave it there, but–

HOLMES

Tell me, when did you come into the room?

BANNISTER

About 4.30 p.m., sir. With Mr Soames's tea. But he wasn't here.

HOLMES

Did you look at the papers on the table?

BANNISTER

No, sir!

'A man can hide behind this curtain.'

HOLMES

Why did you leave the key in the door?

BANNISTER

The tea things were in my hands. I thought, 'I can come back for the key.'

WATSON

Did you forget to come back?

BANNISTER

Yes, sir.

HOLMES

So the room was open all the time. And somebody in the room could get in or out?

BANNISTER

Yes – yes, sir.

HOLMES

When Mr Soames talked to you about the papers, you began to feel ill. So you sat down on the chair over there. Why did you go past the other chairs?

BANNISTER

I – I don't know, sir.

HOLMES

Did you stay here when Mr Soames ran out?

BANNISTER

Only for a minute or two. Then I locked the door and went to my room.

HOLMES

(To Soames ) Mr Soames, I would like to visit the three young gentlemen. Is that all right?

SOAMES

Yes, of course. These rooms are very old, and very interesting. Visitors often go to look at them.

Mr Soames's tea.

SCENE 4

Gilchrist

Holmes, Soames and Watson are outside the door of Gilchrist's room. They are looking at the doorway.

HOLMES

(Quietly ) Remember, gentlemen, you do not have a pencil with you. (The door opens. )

GILCHRIST

What are you—? Oh, it's you, Mr Soames.

SOAMES

Gilchrist, this is Mr Holmes and his friend. They are looking at the building.

HOLMES

Have you got a pencil, Watson? This is a most interesting doorway, and I want to draw it.

He takes some paper from his coat pocket.

WATSON

Oh, no. I'm sorry, Holmes.

HOLMES

(To Gilchrist ) Have you, Mr Gilchrist?

GILCHRIST

A pencil? Oh, yes. (He goes away and comes back with a pencil .) There you are, Mr Holmes. It is a beautiful building.

HOLMES

Ah, thank you. (He looks closely at the pencil, then draws on the paper for a minute or two .) Yes, Mr Gilchrist, a beautiful building.

SCENE 5

Daulat Ras

Holmes, Watson and Soames are in Daulat Ras's room. The Indian is walking up and down the room. He looks worried. Holmes is drawing on a piece of paper.

HOLMES

A very interesting room, Soames. (He gives thepencil to Daulat Ras. ) Thank you, Mr Ras. (And after a pause ) Are you... worried about something?

RAS

Sorry, what did you say? Worried? Oh, yes. It's the – the examination.

HOLMES

Is that all?

RAS

Yes, of course. What—?

HOLMES

Good evening, Mr Ras.

Holmes, Watson and Soames leave the room.

SCENE 6

Miles McLaren

Holmes, Watson and Soames are outside the door of Miles McLaren's room.

MCLAREN

(From inside the room ) Go away! I'm busy! I can't see anybody. Go away at once!

SOAMES

McLaren! This is Mr—

MCLAREN

(From inside the room ) Go away! It's the examination tomorrow. I must study!

'Are you... worried about something?'

HOLMES

Come, my friends. It is not important.

SOAMES

I'm sorry. Mr Holmes. But—

HOLMES

(Walking away ) Is he a tall young man?

SOAMES

Tall? No, McLaren isn't tall. Gilchrist is the tallest of the three.

HOLMES

Good. And now, Mr Soames, good night.

SOAMES

What! Are you going? But tomorrow is the examination! What can I do? How—?

HOLMES

I'm going to take the pieces of pencil and the mud with me. Don't worry. I'm going to come back tomorrow morning with the answer.

SCENE 7

Holmes is thinking

Holmes's room. He and Watson are sitting in chairs.

HOLMES

What do you think, Watson? Who began to copy the papers?

WATSON

McLaren. He said, 'Go away!' But did he want to hide something? Or perhaps... the student from India? Mr Ras? He looked very worried.

HOLMES

Many people are worried before an examination, Watson. It is nothing. And the pencil was no help to us. (He thinks for a minute .) What about Soames's servant?

WATSON

Bannister? He's an honest man, Soames says. That's true, I think.

HOLMES

Yes. So why did an honest man...? Oh dear, I must think. Where's my pipe, Watson?

SCENE 8

All the answers to all the questions

Soames's room. It is morning. A very worried Soames is bringing Holmes and Watson into the room .

SOAMES

Well, Mr Holmes? Can we have the examination later this morning, or must I stop it?

HOLMES

You can have the examination, Mr Soames.

SOAMES

But the young man—

HOLMES

He isn't going to take it.

SOAMES

You know him?

HOLMES

Yes, I do. Please call Bannister.

Soames leaves the room.

WATSON

You have the answer, Holmes?

HOLMES

Yes, my dear Watson. Look. (He opens his hand. In it are three pieces of black mud .)

WATSON

Three! There were only two pieces of mud yesterday. Where did the third piece come from?

Soames comes back into the room with Bannister.

HOLMES

Now Bannister, I want the true story. What happened yesterday?

BANNISTER

(Worried ) I told you everything, sir.

HOLMES

You have nothing more to say? Then I must tell you. When Mr Soames called you into the room yesterday, you saw something on that chair, and you sat on it before Mr Soames could see it.

BANNISTER

No, sir!

HOLMES

Yes! And when Mr Soames went out, to find me, you opened the door and said, 'You can come out now,' to the man hiding behind the curtain.

'I told you everything, sir.'

BANNISTER

(Looking afraid ) There was no man, sir.

HOLMES

That isn't true. But please go and stand next to the bedroom door. (He looks at Soames .) Soames, please go and ask young Gilchrist to come down.

Soames leaves, and comes back with Gilchrist. Gilchrist looks worried when he sees Bannister.

HOLMES

Mr Gilchrist, there are only the five of us to hear your answer to my question. Why did you copy the examination papers yesterday?

Gilchrist looks at Bannister, afraid.

BANNISTER

No, Mr Gilchrist, sir! I never said anything!

HOLMES

No, but you are helping us now, Bannister. (To Gilchrist ) Tell us, Mr Gilchrist.

Gilchrist suddenly begins to cry. Holmes goes across and puts a hand on the young man's arm.

HOLMES

You did something very wrong, Gilchrist, but you're sorry now, I can see that. I'm going to tell you the story, Soames. Mr Gilchrist first saw the papers through the window.

SOAMES

But nobody can get in through the window!

HOLMES

That's true, but a very tall man can look through it from the garden. (He looks at the writing table .) I could not understand this cut, but then I remembered. Gilchrist likes running!

WATSON

But... how does that help, Holmes?

HOLMES

Think, Watson! This young man went running yesterday afternoon. When he walked home, his running shoes were in his hands...

WATSON

And running shoes have spikes! Of course!

HOLMES

Yes. Gilchrist went past his window and looked in – he's a tall young man, you see? He saw the exam papers on the writing table. Then he went past Soames's door – and saw the key in it.

WATSON

And he went into the room and put his shoes on the writing table, and a spike cut into it.

HOLMES

Yes, Watson. (To Gilchrist ) What did you put on that chair near the window?

GILCHRIST

My watch.

HOLMES

(To Soames ) He puts his watch on the chair, then begins to copy one of the papers. 'I'm going to see Mr Soames when he comes back across the garden,' he thinks. But you walk in through the back door, Soames.

'Gilchrist put his shoes on the writing table.'

SOAMES

Then what?

HOLMES

Gilchrist hears you coming, quickly takes his running shoes, and runs into your bedroom to hide. One shoe leaves some black mud behind the curtain. Is this all true, Mr Gilchrist? I found the same black mud on your shoes.

GILCHRIST

Yes, sir, it's true.

SOAMES

(Angrily ) Have you nothing more to say?

GILCHRIST

I – I have a letter here, Mr Soames. Early this morning, I began to write to you... (He takes a letter from his pocket .) It says, 'I'm not going to take the examination. I'm going to South Africa to work for the police there.'

SOAMES

I see. You're not going to take the examination now. I'm pleased to hear that.

GILCHRIST

Mr Bannister talked to me. This is the right thing to do. I understand that now.

HOLMES

Gilchrist was in the bedroom, Bannister, and you didn't tell Mr Soames. When you saw Gilchrist's watch, you sat on it to hide it. Why?

BANNISTER

Well, sir, I was once a servant to Sir Jabez Gilchrist, this young gentleman's father.

HOLMES

Ah!

BANNISTER

When he gambled his money away, I moved to the college to be a servant, but I always remembered Sir Jabez. He was good to me. So I did everything to help his son here.

HOLMES

And yesterday...?

BANNISTER

When Mr Soames called me yesterday, I saw Mr Gilchrist's watch on the chair. 'He looked at the examination papers!' I thought, and I quickly sat down on the watch before Mr Soames saw it.

HOLMES

Then Mr Soames visited me.

BANNISTER

Yes, sir, and I called young Mr Gilchrist. 'You looked at the exam papers,' I said to him. 'Did you copy them?' 'Yes,' he said. 'I did.' 'Then you cannot take the exam,' I said. 'Think of your father! He was an honest man, and you must be honest too.' I wanted to stop him, Mr Holmes.

HOLMES

You were right, Bannister. Well, Soames, you have your answers now. (To Gilchrist ) And you, young man, did wrong, but you're going to put things right. You can thank Bannister for that.

GILCHRIST

I do thank him, sir.

HOLMES

Come, Watson. Our work is finished here.

WATSON

Yes, Holmes.

'Our work is finished here.'

第一场

希尔顿·索姆斯的故事

歇洛克·福尔摩斯坐在桌旁写东西。时近傍晚，华生与希尔顿·索姆斯一起走了进来。

福尔摩斯：

（头也不抬） 谁在门口，华生？

华生：

这位是希尔顿·索姆斯先生，福尔摩斯，他在圣路加学院任教。（福尔摩斯抬起头来。）

索姆斯：

能占用您一点时间吗，福尔摩斯先生？今天学院里发生了一件事，我非常担心。于是我想：“大侦探福尔摩斯先生正造访我们镇。也许他能帮忙！”我就——

福尔摩斯：

我有很多事情要忙，索姆斯先生，也许警方——

索姆斯：

不，不，我不能报警！

福尔摩斯：

好吧，跟我说说是什么事，索姆斯先生。

华生坐下来，但索姆斯依旧站着。

索姆斯：

明天是一场重要考试的第一天，我是考官之一。今天三点的时候，三张考卷送到我这里审阅。当然，每个学生肯定都想在考试前看到这些卷子！

福尔摩斯：

（大笑） 那是当然！

索姆斯：

我们一直都非常小心地保管试卷。我开始审读，但是下午四点半的时候，我去一个朋友家喝茶了。

福尔摩斯：

你把试卷放在哪儿了呢？

索姆斯：

放在我的书桌上。我锁上门，离开了大约一个小时。我回到家的时候，发现门上插着一把钥匙。“这是我的 钥匙吗？”我想，“不是啊，我的在口袋里呢。啊，是班尼斯特的。”班尼斯特是我的仆人。

华生：

他为什么今天下午要去您的房间？

索姆斯：

他每天下午都给我送茶来。

福尔摩斯：

可你去朋友家了。他不记得这事吗？

索姆斯：

是的，所以他的钥匙在我的门上。他一向都很谨慎的，可——

福尔摩斯：

跟我说说试卷的情况。你回到房间的时候，卷子都在什么位置？

索姆斯：

一张在窗边的小桌上，一张在地上，还有一张在书桌上。

福尔摩斯：

（突然来了兴致的样子） 第一张在地上，第二张在窗边，第三张在书桌上。

索姆斯：

（一下子张大了嘴） 没错！您怎么知道的？

福尔摩斯：

（微笑着） 请你接着给我们讲你有趣的经历，索姆斯先生。

索姆斯：

一开始，我想：“是不是班尼斯特看了卷子？”于是我就问了他，可他说：“没有，我没看。”他一向诚实，福尔摩斯先生。

福尔摩斯：

接着发生了什么？

索姆斯：

我跟班尼斯特说了试卷的事，他突然感觉不舒服。他坐到一把椅子上，我给他喝了杯烈酒。然后我仔细察看了靠窗的桌子。

华生：

您发现了什么？

索姆斯：

一些铅笔屑。

福尔摩斯：

有人折断了笔芯，所以削了铅笔？

索姆斯：

是的，也许吧。对，就是这样。

福尔摩斯：

好！这是有用的线索！

索姆斯：

还有两点。我的书桌是新的，可是现在桌面上却有了一道小划痕，另外，桌上还有一小块黑泥。

福尔摩斯：

就这些？

索姆斯：

是的。请您帮帮我，福尔摩斯先生！

福尔摩斯站起来，开始穿大衣。华生也拿起大衣穿上。

福尔摩斯：

这是个有趣的故事，索姆斯先生。告诉我，今天下午试卷送到以后，有没有哪个学生来过您的房间？

索姆斯：

有，道拉特·拉斯，一个印度学生。

福尔摩斯：

当时试卷就放在你的书桌上吗？

索姆斯：

是的，不过他没法看清楚。他离卷子有两三米远。

福尔摩斯：

可那些是试卷。他能看出这一点吗？

索姆斯：

有可能。

福尔摩斯：

试卷在你的房间里。有谁知道这事吗？班尼斯特知道吗？

索姆斯：

不，谁也不知道。

福尔摩斯：

班尼斯特现在在哪儿？

索姆斯：

我冲出来找您的时候，福尔摩斯先生，他还坐在我房间的椅子上。他看起来非常不舒服。

福尔摩斯：

你没有锁门吗？

索姆斯：

是的，但我先把试卷锁起来了。

福尔摩斯：

那么走吧，我们得去你家看看。

三人离开了房间。

第二场

福尔摩斯到访学院

索姆斯、福尔摩斯和华生走进索姆斯的客厅。福尔摩斯走到窗边向外张望。

索姆斯：

那扇窗户通常不开，福尔摩斯先生。没人能从那里进来。

福尔摩斯笑了，停顿了片刻才开口。

福尔摩斯：

你的仆人这会儿不在了，也许他觉得好些了。你出门时他坐在哪把椅子上？

索姆斯：

靠窗的那把。

福尔摩斯：

就在这张小桌边上，是吗？（他沉思片刻。） 是了——是了，当然是这样。那个人进来，从书桌上拿了三张试卷走到窗边，因为……因为当你穿过花园来到前门的时候，他就能看到你，索姆斯！

索姆斯：

可是他没看到我，因为我是从后门进来的。

福尔摩斯：

啊，这一点很有用！现在我能看看那三张卷子吗？

索姆斯用钥匙打开一个盒子拿出了试卷。华生走到福尔摩斯身旁去看试卷。

福尔摩斯：

（看着第一张试卷） 他把这张卷子拿到窗前的桌子上，然后开始抄写。这用了他——十分钟？

华生：

我觉得要一刻钟。

福尔摩斯：

好吧，那就十五分钟。然后他把这张试卷丢在地上，拿了下一张卷子开始抄。这时他听到你从后门进来，索姆斯先生。他得赶快撤！他把第二张试卷留在窗边的桌子上，跑了。——跑到哪儿了呢？你有没有听到他跑上楼去？

索姆斯：

没有。

福尔摩斯：

（仔细察看着桌子） 他写得很快，因为他折断了笔芯，只得重新削铅笔。这很有意思。这支铅笔很长，深蓝色的。看看这些铅笔屑。你注意到金色的字母“NN”了吗？这是一个单词的末尾。你知道Johann Faber牌铅笔吗？

华生：

我知道，福尔摩斯。我就用这个牌子的铅笔。

福尔摩斯走到大书桌旁，从桌上拿起了那一小块黑泥。

福尔摩斯：

这就是那一小团黑泥吧？（他仔细地察看着书桌。） 我能看到那道划痕。（他看向那扇门。） 那是什么门？

索姆斯：

那扇门通往我的卧室。

福尔摩斯：

你跑出去找我之前有没有去卧室？

索姆斯：

没有。

福尔摩斯打开卧室的门，看了看床下。后来，他留意到了那道帘子。

福尔摩斯：

这帘子后面可以藏一个人呢。

他一把拉开了帘子，后面挂着索姆斯的大衣和衣服。这时，福尔摩斯在地上看到了什么东西，就在帘子后面。

福尔摩斯：

这是什么？又是一块泥。您的不速之客当时在这个房间里，索姆斯先生。

索姆斯：

可是——为什么呢？

福尔摩斯：

你稍微想一下。他听到你回来了，他能怎么办呢？他得藏起来！所以他冲进了你的卧室，躲在这道帘子后面。

索姆斯：

啊！那么说我和班尼斯特在隔壁房间的时候，他就在这儿！

福尔摩斯：

是的，说得没错。告诉我，住在你楼上而且得从你的门口经过的学生有几个。

索姆斯：

三个，而且都要参加这次考试。

福尔摩斯：

他们都是谁呢？

索姆斯：

有吉尔克里斯特。他踢足球，喜欢跑步。他父亲是杰贝兹·吉尔克里斯特爵士，曾经很富有，但是却把家产赌得一干二净。年轻的吉尔克里斯特没什么钱，但他学习用功。

福尔摩斯：

那个印度学生呢？

索姆斯：

嗯，道拉特·拉斯这个小伙子话不多，但他学习不错。还有迈尔斯·麦克拉伦，非常聪明的年轻人，可是他不怎么学习，也很担心这次考试。

福尔摩斯：

所以他会想要先看看试卷喽。

索姆斯：

这个……是的，有可能。

福尔摩斯：

我们能跟您的仆人班尼斯特谈谈吗？

第三场

盘问班尼斯特

索姆斯的客厅里，福尔摩斯、华生和索姆斯坐在椅子上。福尔摩斯坐在书桌旁，班尼斯特站在他面前。

福尔摩斯：

班尼斯特，今天你的钥匙插在这个房间的门上，是这样吗？

班尼斯特：

是的，先生。我通常都不会把钥匙忘在门上的，可是——

福尔摩斯：

告诉我，你是什么时间进来的呢？

班尼斯特：

大概四点半，先生。我端了索姆斯先生的茶来，可他没在这儿。

福尔摩斯：

你有没有看桌上的试卷？

班尼斯特：

没有，先生！

福尔摩斯：

你为什么会把钥匙留在门上呢？

班尼斯特：

我手上端着茶具，于是我想：“我可以回来再拿钥匙。”

华生：

你忘记回来了吗？

班尼斯特：

是的，先生。

福尔摩斯：

所以房门一直都是开着的，屋里的人就可以随意进出了吧？

班尼斯特：

是的——是的，先生。

福尔摩斯：

索姆斯先生跟你说试卷的事时，你开始觉得不舒服。于是你就坐到了那边的椅子上。你为什么要走过其他几把椅子去坐那儿呢？

班尼斯特：

我——我不知道，先生。

福尔摩斯：

索姆斯先生出去以后，你一直待在这儿吗？

班尼斯特：

只待了一两分钟，然后我就锁上门回自己房间去了。

福尔摩斯：

（对索姆斯） 索姆斯先生，我想去见见那三位年轻人，可以吗？

索姆斯：

可以，当然可以。这些房间非常古老，也很有特色，经常会有人来参观。

第四场

吉尔克里斯特

福尔摩斯、索姆斯和华生在吉尔克里斯特的房门外。他们看着门道。

福尔摩斯：

（小声说） 记住，先生们，你们身上都没有 带铅笔。（门开了。）

吉尔克里斯特：

你们在——啊，是您啊，索姆斯先生。

索姆斯：

吉尔克里斯特，这位是福尔摩斯先生，这是他的朋友。他们来参观这座楼。

福尔摩斯：

你有铅笔吗，华生？这是个非常特别的门道，我想把它画下来。

他从大衣口袋里掏出几张纸。

华生：

啊，我没带笔，不好意思，福尔摩斯。

福尔摩斯：

（对吉尔克里斯特） 你有吗，吉尔克里斯特先生？

吉尔克里斯特：

铅笔吗？啊，我有。（他走开拿回来一支铅笔。） 给您，福尔摩斯先生。这确实是座美丽的建筑。

福尔摩斯：

啊，谢谢。（他仔细看了看铅笔，然后在纸上画了一两分钟。） 是的，吉尔克里斯特先生，这楼很漂亮。

第五场

道拉特·拉斯

福尔摩斯、华生和索姆斯在道拉特·拉斯的房间里。这个印度人正在屋里走来走去，看上去十分焦虑。福尔摩斯正在一张纸上画着什么。

福尔摩斯：

这个房间非常特别，索姆斯。（他把铅笔递给道拉特·拉斯。） 谢谢你，拉斯先生。（停顿了一下） 你……是在担心什么吗？

拉斯：

不好意思，您刚才说什么？担心？啊，是的，是考——考试。

福尔摩斯：

就只是这件事？

拉斯：

是啊，当然了。有什么——？

福尔摩斯：

再会，拉斯先生。

福尔摩斯、华生和索姆斯离开了房间。

第六场

迈尔斯·麦克拉伦

福尔摩斯、华生和索姆斯站在迈尔斯·麦克拉伦的房门外。

麦克拉伦：

（从房间里传出声音） 走开！我忙着呢！我谁也不见！快走开！

索姆斯：

麦克拉伦，这位是——

麦克拉伦：

（从房间里传出声音） 走开，明天有考试，我得学习！

福尔摩斯：

算啦，朋友们。这没什么关系。

索姆斯：

很抱歉，福尔摩斯先生。可是——

福尔摩斯：

（往外走） 小伙子是个高个子吗？

索姆斯：

高？不，麦克拉伦不怎么高。吉尔克里斯特是三个人当中最高的。

福尔摩斯：

好的。那么，索姆斯先生，晚安。

索姆斯：

什么？您要走了吗？可是明天就要考试了！我怎么办？怎——？

福尔摩斯：

我要把这些铅笔碎屑和泥团带走。别担心，明天早上我会带着答案回来的。

第七场

福尔摩斯思考案情

福尔摩斯的房间。他和华生坐在椅子上。

福尔摩斯：

你怎么看，华生？谁最像抄卷子的人？

华生：

麦克拉伦。他说：“走开！”这难道不是他想隐藏什么吗？或许也有可能……是那个印度来的学生？拉斯先生？他看起来忧心忡忡的。

福尔摩斯：

考试前很多人都会有些焦虑，华生。这没什么。而铅笔并没有帮上什么忙。（他想了一下。） 你怎么看索姆斯的仆人？

华生：

班尼斯特？他是个老实人，索姆斯说的。我觉得这话属实。

福尔摩斯：

是的。可为什么一个老实人……？哎呀，我一定得好好想想。我的烟斗哪儿去了，华生？

第八场

真相大白

索姆斯的房间，时间是早上。满怀焦虑的索姆斯将福尔摩斯和华生领进房间。

索姆斯：

怎么样，福尔摩斯先生？今天上午晚些时候我们能举行考试吗？还是我必须取消考试？

福尔摩斯：

你们可以举行考试，索姆斯先生。

索姆斯：

可是那个年轻人——

福尔摩斯：

他不会参加考试了。

索姆斯：

您知道他是谁了？

福尔摩斯：

是的。请把班尼斯特叫来。

索姆斯离开了房间。

华生：

你有答案了，福尔摩斯？

福尔摩斯：

是的，我亲爱的华生。瞧。（他摊开手掌，手里有三块黑泥。）

华生：

三块！昨天只有两块啊。第三块是哪儿来的？

索姆斯带着班尼斯特回到了房间里。

福尔摩斯：

好吧，班尼斯特，我想听实话。昨天发生了什么事情？

班尼斯特：

（神情焦虑） 我都跟您说过了，先生。

福尔摩斯：

你没有其他什么可以说的了吗？那我得跟你说说了。昨天索姆斯先生把你叫进房间的时候，你看到那张椅子上有东西，于是你在索姆斯先生看到之前坐了上去。

班尼斯特：

不是的，先生！

福尔摩斯：

就是这样的！索姆斯先生出去找我以后，你打开门，对藏在帘子后面的人说：“你现在可以出来了。”

班尼斯特：

（满脸惊恐） 那儿没有人，先生。

福尔摩斯：

根本不是这样。不过，请你走过去站在卧室的门边。（他看着索姆斯。） 索姆斯，请你去叫吉尔克里斯特那个小伙子下来。

索姆斯离开了，带着吉尔克里斯特回来。吉尔克里斯特看到班尼斯特后露出了焦虑的神色。

福尔摩斯：

吉尔克里斯特先生，现在只有我们五个人在场听你回答我的问题。昨天你为什么要抄试卷？

吉尔克里斯特惊恐地看着班尼斯特。

班尼斯特：

不，吉尔克里斯特先生，先生！我什么都没有说！

福尔摩斯：

你是没说，不过你现在可帮了我们的忙啦，班尼斯特。（对吉尔克里斯特） 告诉我们吧，吉尔克里斯特先生。

吉尔克里斯特突然哭了起来。福尔摩斯走过去把手放在了这个年轻人的手臂上。

福尔摩斯：

你做了一件非常不应该的事情，吉尔克里斯特，不过你现在感到后悔了，我能看出来。我准备跟你讲讲事情的来龙去脉，索姆斯。吉尔克里斯特先生一开始是透过窗子看到了试卷。

索姆斯：

可是没人能从那扇窗户进来 ！

福尔摩斯：

确实如此，但是大高个可以从花园里透过窗户看进来。（他看了看书桌。） 我当时想不通这道划痕是怎么来的，可是后来我想起来了。吉尔克里斯特喜欢跑步！

华生：

可……这有什么用呢，福尔摩斯？

福尔摩斯：

动动脑子，华生！这位年轻人昨天下午去跑步了。他往家走的时候，跑鞋就拎在手里……

华生：

而跑鞋上当然是有鞋钉的！

福尔摩斯：

是的。吉尔克里斯特经过这扇窗户，往里面看了看——小伙子是个高个儿，你明白了吧？他看见了书桌上的试卷。然后他路过索姆斯的门口，发现钥匙插在门上。

华生：

于是他进了屋，把鞋子放在了书桌上，鞋钉划伤了桌面。

福尔摩斯：

是的，华生。（对吉尔克里斯特） 你把什么东西放在了靠窗的那把椅子上？

吉尔克里斯特：

我的手表。

福尔摩斯：

（对索姆斯） 他把手表放在了那把椅子上，然后开始抄其中一张试卷。“索姆斯先生穿过花园回来的时候，我会看到他的。”他想。可是你是从后门进来的，索姆斯先生。

索姆斯：

然后怎么样了呢？

福尔摩斯：

吉尔克里斯特听到你来了，赶紧拿起跑鞋，冲进你的卧室藏了起来。一只鞋在帘子后面留下了一块黑泥。是这样吧，吉尔克里斯特先生？我在你的鞋上找到了同样的黑泥。

吉尔克里斯特：

是的，先生，是这样。

索姆斯：

（生气地） 你还有什么要说的吗？

吉尔克里斯特：

我——我这儿有封信，索姆斯先生。今天一大早我就动笔给您写了这封信……（他从口袋里掏出一封信。） 信是这么写的：“我不准备参加考试了，我要去南非为那里的警方工作。”

索姆斯：

我明白了，你现在不打算参加考试了。我很高兴听你这么说。

吉尔克里斯特：

班尼斯特先生跟我谈过，这才是正确的做法。现在我明白了。

福尔摩斯：

吉尔克里斯特当时在卧室里，班尼斯特，而你没有告诉索姆斯先生。你看到吉尔克里斯特的手表时，你坐在上面盖住了它。为什么呢？

班尼斯特：

哦，先生，我曾经是这位年轻人的父亲杰贝兹·吉尔克里斯特爵士的仆人。

福尔摩斯：

啊！

班尼斯特：

他赌光了所有的钱以后，我去了学院当仆人，可我一直都记挂着杰贝兹爵士。他对我很好，所以在这里我尽一切力量来帮助他的儿子。

福尔摩斯：

那么昨天……

班尼斯特：

昨天索姆斯先生叫我来的时候，我看到吉尔克里斯特先生的手表放在椅子上。“他偷看了试卷！”我想，于是趁着索姆斯先生还没发现，我赶紧坐在了那块表上。

福尔摩斯：

后来索姆斯先生就去找我了。

班尼斯特：

是的，先生。于是我就把小吉尔克里斯特先生叫出来。“你看了试卷，”我对他说，“你有没有抄呢？”“有，”他说，“我抄了。”“那你就不能参加考试了。”我说，“想想你父亲！他是个诚实的人，你也要诚实才对。”我希望能够阻止他，福尔摩斯先生。

福尔摩斯：

你做得没错，班尼斯特。那么，索姆斯先生，你现在得到答案了。（对吉尔克里斯特） 而你呢，年轻人，做了错事，但你准备改正错误。你得谢谢班尼斯特。

吉尔克里斯特：

我确实很感谢他，先生。

华生：

好的，福尔摩斯。

'Sherlock Holmes? Oh yes, he often wants me to solve crimes for him. I'm more intelligent than he is, of course.

在世界各地，你都可以找到像雪莉·霍姆斯这样的私人侦探。打开互联网，在谷歌搜索引擎上输入“私人侦探”，会出现680多万条搜索结果。

那么立陶宛青年案是怎么回事呢？这是个人员失踪案。案中有个失踪的15岁女孩，叫卡丽·威廉斯。她有个新交的男朋友，来自立陶宛。案中还有一个哭泣的母亲，一个愤怒的父亲，还有一个伤心的弟弟。

五个星期前卡丽从伦敦的家中出走。她的母亲想让雪莉·霍姆斯找到她。雪莉对伦敦了如指掌，而且，她也能洞察人心……





SHIRLEY HOMESAND THELITHUANIAN CASE


AND THE

LITHUANIAN CASE

You can find private investigators like Shirley Homes anywhere in the world. Put the words 'private investigator' into a Google search on the Internet, and you get more than 6,800,000 hits.

Private investigators do all kinds of detective jobs. Perhaps they look for information about a person... Is that their real name? Where do they live? Where did they live before that? How old are they? Do they really have a university degree from Harvard, USA? Perhaps the job is watching somebody... Where do they go? Who do they meet? What do they talk about? Perhaps a business is losing money, but nobody understands why. A private investigator can listen and watch, day and night, and find an answer.

So what is the Lithuanian Case? It is a missing persons case. There is a missing daughter, Carrie Williams, aged fifteen. There is a new boyfriend, from Lithuania. There is a crying mother, there is an angry father, there is an unhappy little brother.

Carrie left her family home in London five weeks ago. Carrie's mother wants Shirley Homes to find her. Shirley knows London very well – but she also understands people...

1

A missing daughter

Somebody is ringing my office doorbell. It's ten past nine on a Monday morning. That's early for a client to call. But perhaps this is going to be a good week. Last week business was not very good. I need some new clients.

I look at my computer. I want to see the person before I open the door. The little camera over the door shows me a woman in a raincoat. About forty, maybe. Not rich. The raincoat is a cheap one, from the street market. She's carrying a newspaper, the Putney Gazette.

I hit the 'open door' button on the wall. The door opens, and the woman comes in.

'Are you the private investigator? Shirley Homes?' she asks. She looks around the office, probably looking for someone older.

'I am.' I use my older person voice. 'Please sit down, Mrs... er...'

'Williams. Edith Williams,' she says. She sits down in my best chair, and looks around the office again, still looking for that older person.

'How can I help you, Mrs Williams?' I say. 'What's your problem?'

She looks at me then, and the trouble in her face is clear.

'Do you find people?' she says. 'Can you find my daughter? She left home five weeks ago. Just walked out. Took all her things, and walked out. And not a word from her. No phone calls. Not even a text. Nothing.'

The little camera over the door shows me a woman in a raincoat.

Edith Williams is nearly crying now.

'Why?' I ask.

I'm careful. Family problems can be dangerous. You open a door, and all kinds of dark and horrible things come out. And when those dark and horrible things are out, you can never put them back in again.

Edith Williams is still trying not to cry.

'Why, Mrs Williams?' I say again. 'Why did your daughter leave home? Was there an argument?'

'Not with me, no. It's her father, he...' Now she really is crying. Five weeks of crying, all in two minutes in my office.

I get her a cup of coffee, and sit on a chair next to her.

'Tell me all about it, Mrs Williams. Take your time.'

The daughter, Carrie, is fifteen, I learn. She likes boys, has lots of boyfriends, doesn't listen to her parents. So what's new? Many fifteen-year-old girls are like that.

But the new boyfriend, Edith Williams says, is older, and he's not English. He's a foreigner, from Lithuania.

I remember my Ukrainian grandmother, my Greek mother. Foreigners.

'Is that a problem for you?' I ask. 'A foreigner?'

'Tell me all about it, Mrs Williams. Take your time.'

'Not for me, but it is for my husband,' Edith Williams says. 'He doesn't like foreigners. They come here, he says, they take our jobs, they take our houses, they take our money. And they can't speak English. He gets very angry about it. He says some horrible things to Carrie. “I don't want this foreigner in my house,” he says, and Carrie goes crazy. She calls her father some horrible names, and he gets really angry. He's shouting, and Carrie's crying. They don't stop for hours.'

Edith Williams stops for a second. She can still hear the shouting and the crying, I think.

'And what happened next?' I ask quietly.

'The next day,' Mrs Williams says, 'Carrie left. Early in the morning, before we all got up. She left a letter.'

'Have you got the letter?' I ask.

'Yes, I have.' She gives the letter to me, and I read it quickly. An angry letter, from an angry fifteen-year-old. Nothing useful. I give the letter back to her.

'I asked all her friends,' Mrs Williams says. 'Everyone. They didn't know – or they didn't want to tell me. And she's stopped going to school.'

'What about the police?' I ask.

'I can't go to the police. My husband doesn't want to see her again. We can't even say her name at home.'

'We? Who's we?'

'Me and Darren. He's Carrie's little brother. He's ten. He's very unhappy about all this.'

'Carrie calls her father some horrible names, and he gets really angry. He's shouting, and Carrie's crying.'

I must meet Darren. Ten-year-old boys can be very useful. They see and hear a lot.

Edith Williams looks at me with her red eyes. 'Can you find her for me? I just want to know she's all right. And this boyfriend, this Lithuanian... What's he like? How old is he? What does he do? Is he kind? Is he the right person for my little girl?'

I take the job. I ask for a photograph of Carrie, the names of friends, the school, mobile phone numbers.

'Can I talk to Darren?' I ask.

'Yes, we can meet him after school,' Edith Williams says. 'But please don't come to my house. Please. My husband...'

'I understand,' I say. 'I can text you when I have some news.'

She doesn't know the name of the Lithuanian boyfriend. That's really helpful. There are thousands of Lithuanians in London. Finding one young man without a name in thousands of people? How easy is that!

失踪的女儿

我办公室的门铃响了。现在是周一早上9点10分，客户来访的话时间尚早。不过，也许这周的生意会不错。上周的生意不是很好，我需要些新的客户。

我看着电脑。我想先看清楚门外是谁再开门。安在门上方的那个小摄像机显示有一个穿着雨衣的女人。她40岁左右，不是有钱人，那件雨衣是从街头集市买的廉价货。她手里拿着一份《普特尼公报》。

我按下墙上的“开门”按钮。门开了，那个女人走了进来。

“你就是那个私人侦探吗？叫雪莉·霍姆斯？”她问道。她环顾办公室，也许是在寻找一个年纪比我大的人。

“我就是。”我用我听起来比实际年龄大的嗓音说：“请坐，呃……太太。”

“威廉斯，伊迪丝·威廉斯。”她说。她在我最好的那把椅子上坐下来，然后环顾四周，仍然在寻找一个比我年纪大的人。

“有什么需要我帮忙吗，威廉斯太太？”我问道。“您有什么困难？”

这时她才看着我，她的苦恼清晰地写在脸上。

“你找人吗？”她问道，“你能替我找女儿吗？五个星期前她离开了家，就这样出走了。她拿走了自己所有的衣物，就再也没回来。至今都没有她的消息，也没打电话，甚至都没发一条短信。什么都没有。”

说到这儿，伊迪丝·威廉斯快要哭出来了。

“为什么？”我问道。

我很谨慎。家庭问题可能会比较棘手。你打开一扇门，各种隐秘的和可怕的事情就都被抖搂出来。一旦那些隐秘的、可怕的事情被抖搂出来，你就再也无法把它们封存回去了。

伊迪丝·威廉斯还在强忍着眼泪。

“为什么，威廉斯太太？”我再问一遍，“您女儿为什么离家出走？吵架了吗？”

“不是跟我，不是。是跟她父亲，他……”这回她真的哭出来了。五个星期的眼泪啊，来我办公室两分钟之后全都倾倒出来了。

我给她倒了杯咖啡，坐到她旁边的椅子上。

“把事情经过全告诉我吧，威廉斯太太。不着急，慢慢说。”

然后我得知，她失踪的女儿叫卡丽，15岁。她喜欢男孩子，有很多男朋友，不听父母的话。这有什么新鲜的呢？很多15岁的女孩都那样。

伊迪丝·威廉斯说，但是她新交的这个男朋友比她大，而且不是英国人。他来自立陶宛。

我想起我的祖母是乌克兰人，我母亲是希腊人。她们都是外国人。

“这对你来说是个问题吗？”我问，“外国人？”

“对我来说不是问题，但是对我丈夫来说是个问题。”伊迪丝·威廉斯说，“他不喜欢外国人。他说他们来这里，抢走了我们的工作，占领了我们的房子，拿走了我们的钱。而且他们不会说英语。他对此感到非常气愤。他对卡丽说了些难听的话。他说：‘我不要让这个外国人出现在我家里。’卡丽气疯了。她用很难听的话骂她父亲，他气坏了。他在大吼大叫，卡丽在哭。他们吵了好几个小时。”

伊迪丝·威廉斯沉默了一会儿。我想，她耳边仍然能听到吼叫声和哭泣声吧。

“后来发生什么呢？”我轻声问。

“第二天，”威廉斯太太接着说道，“卡丽走了。趁我们都还没起床，一大早就走了。她留下了一封信。”

“信您带来了吗？”我问。

“有，我带来了。”她把信递给我，我飞快扫了一眼信的内容。字里行间充满了愤怒，出自一个愤怒的15岁少女之手。没有什么有用的信息。我把信还给她。

“我问了她所有的朋友。”威廉斯太太说，“每个朋友都询问过了。她们都不知道，或者她们不想告诉我。她已经不去上学了。”

“警察那边有什么消息？”我问。

“我不能去警察局报警。我丈夫不想再见到她。我们在家里甚至不能提她的名字。”

“我们？‘我们’是谁？”

“我和达伦。他是卡丽的弟弟，今年10岁。现在发生的这一切让他非常伤心。”

我必须见见达伦。10岁的孩子也许可以帮上大忙。很多事情都逃不过他们的眼睛和耳朵。

伊迪丝·威廉斯用红肿的眼睛看着我。“您能帮我找到我女儿吗？我只是想知道她没事。还有，她的这个男朋友，这个立陶宛人……他长什么样？多大了？他是做什么工作的？他人好吗？他适合我女儿吗？”

我接下了这活儿，向她要了一张卡丽的照片、卡丽朋友们的名字、学校的名字和所有相关人员的手机号码。

“我能跟达伦谈谈吗？”我问道。

“可以，我们可以去接他放学。”伊迪丝·威廉斯说，“不过，请不要去我家。千万别去。我丈夫……”

“我明白，”我说，“有消息的话，我可以给你发短信。”

她不知道她女儿的那个立陶宛男朋友的名字。名字可是真正 有用的线索。伦敦有成千上万的立陶宛人。从这成千上万人当中找到一个不知道名字的年轻人？谈何容易！

Help from friends

I begin with Carrie, of course. I have a name and a photograph, and a school. I meet Darren when he comes out of school, and we go to Carrie's school. We sit in my car and watch the students when they leave.

'That's Janice – look!' says Darren. 'The girl with long black hair. She's very friendly with Carrie. And that's Kim, next to her. I like Kim. She's funny, she makes me laugh. Ooh, and that's Ant. See – the one with very short hair and black clothes.'

'Ant? What name is that? Anthea?'

'Don't know,' says Darren. 'She's just Ant.'

I take a quick photo of the three girls, and then I take Darren for a pizza to say thank you.

'Can you find my sister?' he says. 'It's horribly quiet at home without her. Nobody ever laughs now. Mum cries all night. I hear her.'

I look at his small boy face. 'Yup. I can find her.'

That evening I phone my friend in the police. He's a detective– Detective Sergeant Saheed Patel.

'Hi, Saheed, how are you?'

We sit in my car and watch the students when they leave.

'Can you find my sister?' Darren says.

'Fine. What's new with you?' Saheed says. 'Are you working on a case?'

'Yes, I've got a missing persons case – a missing girl. Her mother came to me today. The girl left home five weeks ago after an argument with her father about her boyfriend... a Lithuanian boyfriend.'

'How old is the girl?' Saheed asks.

'Fifteen.'

'Oh dear.' Saheed is not surprised. 'Every day we get missing persons reports – do you know how many?'

'No. Tell me. How many?'

'The police in Britain get about 1,000 reports every day,' Saheed says. 'And nearly one third of those are young people between the ages of fifteen and seventeen. When did the mother make the report to the police?'

'She didn't. The girl's father doesn't want to see her again,' I say. 'So, no police, no missing persons report, and no looking for her. That's what the mother told me.'

'OK. Be careful, Shirley. The girl's only fifteen. She can't get married before she's sixteen, and the law says—'

'I know all that, Saheed! I know the law!'

'Of course you do. Sorry.' There's a smile in Saheed's voice. 'So what do you want from me?'

'Can you help with the Lithuanian boyfriend?' I say. 'Where do I look for him? Can you give me some names? People to talk to.'

There's a smile in Saheed's voice.

'Maybe. But there are about 200,000 Lithuanians in London. When do you want this? I have work to do, you know.'

'I'm going to try the girl's school friends first,' I say. 'Can you do it in a day or two? Text me when you have something.'

'OK. Bye now.'

The next day at four o'clock, I'm outside Carrie's school. I have my photo of the three girls, and I soon see them. They're standing, all three of them, in the street, looking at their mobile phones and laughing. I walk over to them.

'Hi, guys,' I say. 'You're friends of Carrie Williams, right? I need your help.'

'Carrie Williams?' says the girl called Ant. 'Who's she?'

I watch the girls' faces. They know Carrie, all right. And they know she's missing. But how much do they know?

'Ah, come on,' I say. 'You're Carrie's best friends. I'm looking for her. I need to find her.'

'And who are you?' asks the girl called Janice.

I give them my card.

The girl called Kim laughs. 'Shirley Homes? Are you the granddaughter of Sherlock Holmes or something?'

I smile. I get this all the time, again and again. And again. 'Great-great-granddaughter. He lived in the 1890s.'

'Wow! Really? That is awesome!' says Kim.

Janice and Ant laugh. 'Kim, you idiot! Sherlock Holmes wasn't a real person. He's just a detective in stories on television.'

'Er, and in books,' I say. 'The books were first.'

The girls look at me, and their faces are more friendly now.

'OK, Shirley Homes, great-great-granddaughter of Sherlock,' says Ant. 'How can we help you? Who are you looking for? What was her name again?'

Ant is going to be difficult, I can see that. She's a good friend of Carrie's, and she's not going to talk.

'Do you have mothers?' I say. 'All three of you?'

The girls stare at me. 'Of course we have mothers,' says Janice. 'What are you talking about?'

'Do you love your mothers? Do your mothers love you?' I say. 'Well, listen. Carrie's mother loves her daughter. And now Carrie's mother can't sleep at night. She doesn't eat. She cries about Carrie all the time. She wants to know that Carrie is all right . Can you understand that? She just wants to know .'

Kim looks at me with big eyes. 'Oh, poor Mrs Williams!' she says.

Ant gives her an angry look. 'We don't know Carrie Williams!' she says. 'Remember?'

Janice looks at me. 'Give us a minute,' she says. 'We need to talk.'

They move away, turn their backs to me, and talk quietly. I can't hear them. Then they come back to me.

'OK,' says Ant. 'What do you want?'

'You know Café Nero in Putney High Street?' I say. 'Tell Carrie this. I'm going to be in Café Nero at 18.30 tomorrow evening, and 18.30 the evening after that. I want to see her and talk to her. I want to know she's alive and well. That's all. Then I can tell her mother, and Mrs Williams can stop crying all night.'

'OK,' Ant says. 'We got it.'

'Thanks, guys,' I say. 'See you around.'

'See you,' they say.

Ant gives Kim an angry look. 'We don't know Carrie Williams!'

朋友们的帮助

不用说，我先从卡丽着手。我知道她的名字，有她的照片，知道她的学校。达伦一出校门，我便迎了上去，然后我们一起去了卡丽的学校。我们坐在我的车里，看着学生们从学校走出来。

“那是贾尼丝——看！”达伦说，“那个黑色长发的女孩。她跟卡丽的关系非常好。她旁边是金。我喜欢金，她很风趣，总是逗得我大笑。哦，那是安特。看见了吗？短头发，穿黑色衣服的那个。”

“安特？全名是什么？安西娅吗？”

“不知道，”达伦说，“我们都叫她安特。”

我迅速拍了张这三个姑娘的照片，然后带达伦去吃比萨饼，以示感谢。

“你能找到我姐姐吗？”达伦问，“她不在家，家里安静得可怕。现在家里看不到笑容。妈妈整夜地哭，我听见的。”

我看着这个小男孩的脸，说：“没问题，我能找到她。”

当天晚上，我给警察局的一个朋友打了个电话。他是个侦缉警长———萨希德·帕特尔探长。

“嗨，萨希德，你好吗？”

“还行。你最近怎么样？”萨希德问，“在办案子吗？”

“是的，我接了一桩失踪案——一个失踪女孩的案子。她妈妈今天来找我。那个女孩五个星期前因为她的男朋友而跟她爸爸大吵了一架，然后离家出走了……她的男朋友是个立陶宛人。”

“那个女孩多大？”萨希德问。

“15岁。”

“哦。”萨希德并不吃惊。“我们每天都会接到有人失踪的报案——你知道有多少吗？”

“不知道。快告诉我吧，有多少？”

“英国的警察局每天大约接到1,000起人员失踪的报案，”萨希德说，“其中将近三分之一的失踪人员是年龄在15岁到17岁的年轻人。那个妈妈是什么时候向警察局报案的？”

“她没有报案。女孩的爸爸不想再见到自己的女儿。”我说，“所以，没有警察介入，没有人员失踪报案，也没有人去找她。这是那位妈妈告诉我的。”

“好吧。雪莉，你要小心点。那个女孩只有15岁。她要到16岁才能结婚，而且根据法律……”

“这些我都知道，萨希德。我懂法律的！”

“你当然知道了，抱歉。”萨希德笑着说，“那么，你想要我帮你做怎么？”

“你能在那个立陶宛男朋友方面帮我提供一点信息吗？”我问，“我该去哪儿找他？你能提供一些人名吗？那些可以见面谈谈的人。”

“也许可以。不过，伦敦大约有20万立陶宛人。你什么时候要？我手头还有工作，你知道的。”

“我打算先去试着见见那个女孩在学校里的朋友。”我说，“你能在一两天内搞定吗？如果你有什么消息，就给我发短信吧。”

“好的。那么，再见。”

第二天下午4点，我等在卡丽的学校外边。我拿着那三个女孩的照片，很快就看到了她们。她们三个人站在街上，边看各自的手机边笑。我向她们走过去。

“嗨，姑娘们，”我说，“你们是卡丽·威廉斯的朋友，对吧？我需要你们的帮助。”

“卡丽·威廉斯？”那个叫安特的女孩说，“她是谁？”

我留神观察姑娘们的脸。她们肯定认识卡丽，而且她们知道她失踪了。但是，她们知道多少呢？

“哎，得了吧，”我说，“你们是卡丽最好的朋友。我正在找她。我必须找到她。”

“那么你是谁？”叫贾尼丝的女孩问道。

我把名片递给了她们。

叫金的女孩笑了起来。“雪莉·霍姆斯？你是那个叫歇洛克·福尔摩斯① 还是什么的人的孙女吗？”

我笑了。我总是碰到这样的问题，一次又一次。这次又是这样。“应该是曾曾孙女。他生活在19世纪90年代。”

“哇！真的吗？那可太棒了！”金说道。

贾尼丝和安特笑起来。“金，你这个傻瓜！世界上没有歇洛克·福尔摩斯。他只是电视剧里的一个侦探。”

“呃，也出现在书里，”我说，“先出版的是书。”

女孩们看着我，此时她们脸上的表情友善多了。

“好吧，雪莉·霍姆斯，歇洛克的曾曾孙女，”安特说，“我们能帮你做什么？你在找谁？你再说一遍，她叫什么来着？”

看得出来，安特是个很难对付的人。她是卡丽的好朋友，她不会说的。

“你们有妈妈吗？”我问，“你们三个？”三个女孩盯着我。“我们当然有妈妈了，”贾尼丝说，“你在说什么呢？”

“你们爱妈妈吗？你们的妈妈爱你们吗？”我说，“嗯，听着。卡丽的妈妈爱她的女儿。她现在夜不能寐，也不吃东西，一直为卡丽哭泣。她想知道卡丽是不是平安无事 。你们能理解吗？她只是想知道 女儿的近况。”

金瞪大眼睛看着我。“噢，可怜的威廉斯太太！”她说道。

安特生气地瞪了她一眼。“我们不认识卡丽·威廉斯！”她说，“记得吗？”

贾尼丝看着我。“等我们一会儿，”她说，“我们需要谈一谈。”

她们走到一旁，背对着我小声交谈。我听不见她们在说什么。过了一会儿，她们回到我面前。

“好吧，”安特说，“你想要知道什么？”

“你们知道普特尼大街上的尼罗咖啡馆吧？”我说，“告诉卡丽，我明天晚上6点30分会在尼罗咖啡馆，后天晚上6点30分也会在那里。我想见她，想跟她聊聊。我想知道她还活着，过得不错。如此而已。然后我就可以告诉她妈妈，让威廉斯太太不用再整晚整晚地哭泣了。”

“好的，”安特说，“我们明白了。”

“谢谢，姑娘们，”我说，“再见。”

“再见。”女孩们说。

Talking to Carrie

Carrie doesn't come the first evening. I sit there for two hours, and drink a lot of coffee. Five big cups, black, no sugar. It's a good thing I like coffee.

But she comes the second evening. I'm sitting with my back to the wall, watching the door. Through the café window I see Ant in her black clothes. She's walking past, slowly, looking into the café. A minute or two later Carrie comes in, and walks over to my table. Red hair, green eyes, no smile. I stand up.

'Hi, Carrie. I'm Shirley Homes. Thanks for coming. Have a seat. Can I get you a coffee, or a tea?'

I'm using my head teacher voice. Right, girls, sit down. Open your books. Get to work. I don't want Carrie to have time to think.

She doesn't want coffee, or tea. She wants to have an argument.

'I'm not going home,' she says. 'So you can forget that. I don't need my family. I have a new life now.'

I watch her face, and she stares back at me with angry green eyes. I don't think Carrie is in trouble. Carrie knows what she wants, and Carrie gets what she wants. I think Carrie makes trouble. I begin to feel sorry for the boyfriend.

'Why are you here, Carrie?' I say. 'What did your friends say to you?'

A minute or two later Carrie comes in, and walks over to my table.

She doesn't answer, just looks at me.

'Did they tell you about your mum – crying all night because her little girl is living on the streets, because her little girl is taking drugs, because her little girl is in big, big trouble—'

Suddenly, Carrie has a lot to say. 'I'm NOT living on the streets!' she shouts at me. 'And I don't do drugs – I NEVER do drugs! Who told you all this? It's NOT TRUE!'

People in the café turn their heads to look at us. I smile around at everybody. A smile to say, Everything's fine here. Just a big sister, little sister argument. Happens all the time. Enjoy your coffee, have a nice day...

I look back at Carrie's angry face.

'But your mum doesn't know that,' I say quietly. 'At night, when she can't sleep, she thinks about those things. You're only fifteen, Carrie, and it's a big bad world out there. Of course your mum is afraid for you.'

Carrie looks down at the table. 'Yeah. Well...' She looks up. 'But I'm OK. I'm fine. You can tell her that.'

'Why don't you tell her?' I say. 'Call her. Text her.'

Carrie stares at me. 'Who sent you?' she says. 'Mum? Or was it my dad?'

'Your mum.'

'Look, I'm not texting mum, because I don't want my dad to know. I don't want to see him again, ever.'

People in the café turn their heads to look at us.

'We're not talking about your dad,' I say quickly. 'I know all about your dad. We're talking about your mum. And your mum needs to know you're all right. But she needs to hear it from you , not me. She texts you every day, you know. And you never text back. Never.'

Carrie looks away. 'I got a new mobile, and changed my number. I never got her texts.'

I laugh. 'Very good, Carrie. You read detective stories, right? Always change your mobile when you don't want people to find you. Dangerous things, mobile phones.'

Carrie nearly smiles. 'Tomas says—' she begins, then stops.

'Is Tomas your boyfriend?' I say. 'The one from Lithuania? Are you still with him?'

'Of course I'm still with him!' Carrie is angry again. 'I love him and he loves me. We're in love!'

I try not to smile. How wonderful to be fifteen, and in love for the first time!

'That's great,' I say. 'I'm happy for you. But please, please text your mum. Tell her you're all right.'

'OK,' says Carrie. 'This evening.' She looks at her watch and stands up. 'I must go. I'm meeting someone.'

'Thanks for coming, Carrie. And remember that text.'

She walks out of the café, and fifteen seconds later I'm following her. She's walking down the High Street, maybe to the bus station. I've got a minute, but I must be quick.

A private investigator always needs to carry a big bag. I stop by a shop window, and open my bag. Three seconds later, I'm wearing a blue T-shirt over my red T-shirt. In another five seconds, I have a wig on, and my short black hair is now long blond hair. Now I'm walking away from the shop window, and I'm wearing glasses. My big brown bag is now inside a small black backpack. No time to change the shoes. Carrie is a long way down the street. I walk fast, nearly running, and watch her red head in front of me.

When I get to the bus station, I can't see her at first, and walk quickly past all the people waiting. She's there, waiting for the number 71 bus. I wait too, about twenty metres away, and I'm reading the evening newspaper with great interest. (A private investigator always has today's newspaper in their bag.) But Carrie doesn't look round.

When the bus comes, Carrie goes upstairs. This is good news for me because I can sit downstairs, at the back of the bus. I can see Carrie when she gets off, but she can't see me.

It's a short bus ride, only ten minutes. Carrie gets off the bus, and turns left into a small street. I'm thirty metres behind her. Carrie looks round, once, and sees someone with blond hair, in a blue T-shirt, and glasses. She doesn't know me.

Halfway down the street, she crosses the road and goes into a big old house. I walk past the house, not too fast, not too slow. I can't follow her into the house because there are no other people around. You can only hide easily when there are lots of people around.

I'm reading the evening newspaper with great interest.

I take the next right, walk for ten minutes, then turn around and come back. This time I walk to the front door of the big house. There are six bells by the door with names next to them. It's a house with six different apartments. I look at the names, but there isn't a 'Williams' next to any bell. Well, of course not. She's living with her Lithuanian boyfriend. I look at the names again... John Ozumba, K. Brown, Lili Sardelli, R. varnaite, T. Grigas, M. M. Westerbrook.

Varnaite and Grigas... Lithuanian names, I think. Tomas Grigas, perhaps?

You can't stand in a quiet street and watch a house. Everybody looks at you and says, 'Who's that woman? What's she doing?' But you can watch a house from a car. People often sit in cars, waiting for somebody, having a sleep, checking their phone messages...

I go home, make some spaghetti for dinner, and text Edith Williams.

Saw C today. She's fine.

More tomorrow.

There are six bells by the door with names next to them.

与卡丽交谈

第一天晚上，卡丽没来。我在咖啡馆里坐了两个小时，喝了很多咖啡——五大杯没加糖的黑咖啡。还好，我喜欢咖啡。

不过第二天晚上她来了。我靠墙而坐，看着门。透过咖啡馆的窗户，我看到安特身着黑衣，慢慢地从咖啡馆走过，边走边往里头张望。过了一会儿，卡丽进来走到我的桌边。红色的头发，绿色的眼睛，紧绷着脸。我站了起来。

嗨，卡丽。我是雪莉·霍姆斯。谢谢你能来。请坐。要杯咖啡还是茶？”

我用学校校长的腔调说道。好的 ，姑娘们 ，坐下 。翻开书 。开始学习 。我不想让卡丽有时间思考。

她不想喝咖啡，也不想喝茶。她想来吵一架。

“我不回家，”她说，“所以你别想让我回去。我不需要家人。我现在有了新的生活。”

我看着她的脸，她也瞪着我，绿色的眼睛里满含怒火。我觉得卡丽没事。她知道自己想要什么，而且得到了她想要的。我认为卡丽在制造 麻烦。我开始同情她的男朋友。

“你为什么来这里，卡丽？”我问道，“你的朋友们跟你说什么了？”

她没有回答，只是看着我。

“她们跟你说你妈妈了吗——整夜哭泣，因为她的宝贝女儿露宿街头，因为她的宝贝女儿吸食毒品，因为她的宝贝女儿遇到了很大、很大的麻烦——”

突然，卡丽的话来了。“我没有 露宿街头！”她冲我嚷道，“而且我也没有吸食毒品——我从来 不碰毒品！谁告诉你这些的？都是没有的事 ！”

咖啡馆里的人纷纷扭头看我们。我环顾四周，冲众人微笑。那笑容是在说，我们没事 。只是大姐姐和小妹妹在争执 。这种情况随时都有可能发生 。享用你们的咖啡，祝你们好心情 ……

我收回目光，看着满脸愤怒的卡丽。

“但是你说的这些情况，你妈妈并不知道。”我平静地说，“晚上，当她无法入睡时，她就会想到我说到的那些情形。你只有15岁，卡丽，外面的世界又大又乱。你妈妈当然会担心你。”

卡丽低头看着桌子。“是的。不过……”她抬起头，“不过，我没事，我很好。你可以这么告诉她。”

“为什么你 不告诉她呢？”我说，“给她打个电话，或者给她发个短信。”

卡丽瞪着我。“谁让你来的？”她问，“我妈妈吗？或者是我爸爸？”

“你妈妈。”

“听着，我不会给妈妈发短信的，因为我不想让爸爸知道。我不想再见到他了，永远。”

“我们不是在谈你爸爸，”我马上说，“我知道你爸爸的情况。我们在谈你的妈妈。你妈妈需要知道你平安无事。但她需要你亲自 告诉她，而不是我来说。她每天都给你发短信，你是知道的。而你却从来没有回复。一直没有。”

卡丽躲开我的目光。“我买了新手机，换了号码。我没收到过她的短信。”

我笑了。“很好，卡丽。你读过侦探小说，对不对？不想让人找到你的时候就换手机。手机，危险物品。”

卡丽差点笑了出来。“托马斯说……”她刚一开口，又顿住了。

“托马斯是你的男朋友吗？”我问，“那个立陶宛来的男孩？你还跟他在一起吗？”

“我当然还跟他在一起！”卡丽又气呼呼地说，“我爱他，他也爱我。我们在谈恋爱！”

我尽量不让自己笑出来。15岁是多么美好的年华，第一次谈恋爱是多么美妙！

“那好极了，”我说，“我为你高兴。不过，请一定、一定给你妈妈发短信，告诉她你一切安好。”

“好吧，”卡丽说，“我今天晚上发。”她看了看表，站了起来。“我得走了。我要见个人。”

“谢谢你来，卡丽。记住发短信。”

卡丽走出了咖啡馆。15秒钟之后，我跟上了她。她沿着大街走，也许是去汽车站。我有一分钟的时间，但我必须动作快。

私人侦探总是得拎着一个大包。我在一家商店的橱窗旁停下来，打开包。3秒钟后，我在红色T恤外边套了件蓝色T恤。又用5秒钟戴上了假发，我原来黑色短发现在变成了金色长发。然后我离开橱窗，戴上副眼镜。我把棕色的大包塞进一个黑色的双肩包里。没时间换鞋了。卡丽已经走出去很远了。我快步走着，几乎是一路小跑，紧盯着前边卡丽的红色头发。

到了公共汽车车站后，一开始我没看见她，于是飞快地走过所有等车的乘客。她在那儿，正在等71路公交车。我也在距离她20米开外等着车，并且非常专心地看晚报。（私人侦探的包里总有一份当天的报纸。）但是卡丽并没有四处张望。

公共汽车来了，卡丽上了汽车的上一层。这对我来说是件好事，因为我可以坐在汽车下层的后部。这样，卡丽下车时我可以看见她，但她却看不到我。

路程并不远，只有10分钟就到了。卡丽下了车，向左拐到了一条小街上。我跟在她后边，离她大约30米。卡丽回头看了一眼，看见一个金发披肩，穿蓝色T恤，戴眼镜的女子。她没认出我。

走到街道的一半时，她穿过马路，走进一座旧大楼。我从大楼前走过，步子不快不慢。我不能跟着她走进去，因为里边没有别人。只有周围有很多人时，你才容易藏身。

我走到街角向右拐，走了10分钟后，再转身走回来。这次，我走到那座大楼的前门。门边有六个门铃，每个门铃边都有名字。这座大楼有六套公寓。我看了看那些名字，可是没有哪个门铃旁边写有“威廉斯”。嗯，当然不会有了。她跟她的立陶宛男朋友住在一起。我又看了看这些名字……约翰·奥宗巴、K.布朗、莉莉·萨尔代利、R.瓦内特、T.格里加斯、M.M.韦斯特布鲁克。

瓦内特和格里加斯……立陶宛名字，我心想。也许是托马斯·格里加斯？

你不能在一条安静的街上，盯着一座楼房看。每个看到你的人都会想：“那个女人是谁？她在干什么？”但是，你可以在车上监视一座房子。人们经常坐在车里等人、睡觉、查看手机短信……

我回到家，做了点意大利面条当晚饭，然后给伊迪丝·威廉斯太太发了条短信：

今天看见C了。她很好。

明天再告诉你更多消息。

The boyfriend

The next day I'm in the street in my car, opposite the house. I have a cup of coffee, a newspaper, and a lot of time. I want to see Tomas, and talk to him. Then I can make my report to Mrs Williams, and the job is finished.

At 17.45 Carrie walks down the street, and goes into the house. I'm watching carefully now. People are coming home from work... in cars, on bicycles, on foot. Lots to watch. Two people go into the house, a young woman and a short, older man with white hair.

At 18.25 a young man walks down the street. Tall, with dark hair. He walks to the front door, and in two seconds I'm out of the car, across the street, and standing behind him at the door.

He opens the door, and turns to look at me.

'Hi!' I say. 'OK to come in? I'm visiting Mike Westerbrook at number six.'

'Yes, that's OK,' the young man says. He holds the door open for me, and we walk up the stairs together.

'Nice and sunny today,' I say. 'But rain's coming in later, they say.'

'Mmm,' says the young man.

At the top of the stairs he turns to the door with number 4 on it, gets out his key, and opens the door. Suddenly, I run back to him.

In two seconds I'm standing behind him at the door.

'Hey, excuse me! Is this yours? It was on the floor.' In my hand I'm holding a weekly bus ticket. It's more than two months old, but he can't see that because I've got my hand over the date.

He looks at the ticket, and I look through the open door of number 4... and see Carrie in the room. Then I'm through the door and inside the apartment.

'Hey!' the young man shouts at me. 'What are you doing? Who are you? Get out!'

I turn to Carrie. 'Hello, Carrie,' I say. 'Did you text your mum last night?'

The young man is next to me now. 'Who is this?' he says to Carrie. 'What's this about?' He stares at me angrily.

Carrie looks angry too. 'She's a private investigator,' she tells the young man. 'Mum sent her. I talked to her yesterday in the café. I told you, remember?'

'Ah!' The young man suddenly smiles. He has a very nice smile. 'How exciting! I never met a private investigator before. How do you do? I am Tomas Varnas, and I'm very pleased to meet you.'

He holds out his hand, and we shake hands. Wrong name, I think. Not the name on the door. But this is the Lithuanian boyfriend.

'Shirley Homes. Pleased to meet you too,' I say. 'I'm sorry about this. But I need to talk to you. Carrie's mother—'

'Of course,' says Tomas. 'I understand. Please – sit down. Can I get you some coffee?'

'Hello, Carrie,' I say. 'Did you text your mum last night?'

He and Carrie make coffee, and we all sit down round a table. Tomas looks at me, smiling.

'So,' he says. 'You want to ask me questions, so you can tell Carrie's mother all about me. I am very happy about that. What do you want to know? Shall I begin?'

So I listen to the story of Tomas Varnas's life. He is nineteen years old, and comes from Vilnius in Lithuania. He came to London six months ago because he wants to start a business. His family make linen cloth in Vilnius, and Tomas wants to sell it in England. At the moment he's working Monday to Friday in a hospital because he needs the money. But he's selling linen in the street market on Saturdays. Business is good, and is getting better every week.

Carrie wants to tell me more about it. 'It's beautiful linen, you know. The best in the world. I'm learning all about it.' She's excited, I can see it in her green eyes.

Tomas is smiling. 'Carrie is very good with the colours of the linen,' he says. 'She wants to work with me. And she's good at business too – very good. Better than me.'

He puts the back of his hand against Carrie's face, just a touch, a very gentle touch, and smiles into her eyes. She looks up at him, and the love in her eyes is clear. For a second or two the world stops for them. These two young people are very much in love.

Carrie looks at me again. 'Everybody wants to wear clothes made of linen now, you see. So our business is going to get bigger.'

Tomas is selling linen in the street market on Saturdays.

'Lots of hard work,' says Tomas. 'But we're young, we can work hard, no problem about that. But we do have one problem.' He looks at Carrie. 'Your family.'

'Oh, that!' Carrie says. 'Not important. I don't need them. We're fine without them.'

'Not so,' Tomas says gently. 'Your mother is unhappy, your little brother is unhappy, and your father too.'

'No, he isn't! My father is a horrible man! We have arguments all the time. Every day he tells me, "do this, don't do that, do this." He's always right, and I'm always wrong! Always! He never listens to me. He doesn't understand me, he doesn't want to understand me. He's just horrible ...'

'Shhh, shhh,' Tomas says. 'When people are angry, sometimes they say bad things. Maybe they don't really think that. You and your father have a lot of arguments, and you both get angry and say things.'

'Yes, but...' Carrie says.

I sit and listen. This is not their first argument, and it's not going to be their last one. It's interesting to listen to them. Tomas is very gentle with Carrie, but he's strong too. He's in love, but he still thinks clearly.

'Er, excuse me,' I say. 'I'm still here, you know.'

They look at me. Tomas laughs. 'Sorry!' he says. 'We talk about this often. In the end, Carrie must go back home. She knows that.'

'No, I don't!' says Carrie. 'I'm not going back home. No way!'

'But Carrie – you can't cut your family out of your life. Family is important. My family is important to me. And I want you to have your family too... to be friends with your mother, and your father. And your little brother!'

They're off again. I'm trying not to smile. This argument is going to run and run. I think Tomas is good for Carrie.

'Well, I'm done here,' I say. 'It was good to meet you, Tomas. I can tell Mrs Williams about you now. And, well... good luck to both of you.'

Carrie smiles. 'Thanks, Shirley. Can I call you Shirley? Ant and Janice said you were all right. I sent mum a text last night, you know.'

Tomas stands up too. 'I must get home now,' he says.

I stare at him, surprised. 'Home? You live here, in this apartment. Don't you?'

'No, no, no,' Tomas says. 'Of course not! Carrie is fifteen. We cannot marry before she is sixteen years old. It is against the law. So of course I don't live here. It is not correct.'

'But this is your apartment—?'

'No, no,' Tomas says again. 'It's my sister's apartment. Carrie lives here with my sister, Ruta Varnaite. She's working late tonight. I have a room with a friend near Putney Bridge.'

I'm very surprised. I sit down again and look at Carrie. 'Why didn't you tell me? Everybody thinks you're living with Tomas.'

They're off again. I'm trying not to smile.

Carrie doesn't look pleased. 'Well, I didn't tell them that. But my dad always thinks the worst. And sometimes my mum too. But we can get married next year, when I'm sixteen.'

Tomas laughs. He pulls her hair, gently. 'Sixteen is still very young to get married. We can wait. I want to know your family first, and you want to know my family.'

'Yes, I really want to meet your family,' Carrie says. 'But you don't want to meet mine, you really don't.'

Tomas pulls her hair again, not so gently this time. 'Of course I do. I want to talk to your father, I want him to like me. We have all the time in the world, Carrie. Let's just take our time, eh?'

Carrie tries to look angry, then she laughs, and puts her arms around him.

Tomas and I leave the house together. He walks with me to my car.

'I'm sorry about Mr Williams,' he says. 'I think he loves Carrie a lot. Maybe I can meet him and talk to him one day. But Mrs Williams doesn't need to be afraid for Carrie. Please tell her that.'

'Of course,' I say. I've got a lot to say to Mrs Williams. Tomas and I shake hands again, and say goodbye.

I drive back to my office, and check my messages. There's a message from Saheed. Call me about the Lithuanian boyfriend .

I send him a text.

Found the boyfriend, thanks.

And the girl. All well, no problems.

Easy case, nothing horrible.

But thanks for the help!

SH

A text comes back from Saheed at once.

Oh, thanks a lot! I made 12 phone calls for you, all for nothing! Next time, YOU can help ME!

SP

Oh dear! Saheed is not pleased. I often need his help so I must be nice to him. I send him another text.

Sorry! Really really sorry!

Can I buy you a beer tonight?

SH

A text comes back from him.

OK. The King's Arms, by the river.

9 o'clock this evening. See you.

男朋友

第二天，我到了那条街，把车停在那座楼房对面，坐在车里。我有一杯咖啡、一份报纸，还有大把的时间。我想见托马斯，跟他谈谈。然后，我就可以向威廉斯太太汇报，我的工作也就完成了。

下午5点45分，卡丽从街的一头走过来，进了那座楼房。我开始仔细观察。人们下班回家……开车的、骑车的、步行的，我目不暇接。有两个人走进那座大楼，是一个年轻的女人和一个比她年长的白发矮个子男人。

6点25分，一个年轻小伙子从街那头走过来。高个子、深色头发。他走到那座大楼的前门，两秒钟后，我下了车，穿过街道，站在他的身后。

他开了门，扭头看着我。

“嗨！”我说，“我能进去吗？我要去六号的迈克·韦斯特布鲁克家。”

“行，进来吧，”那年轻人说。他替我撑住门，我们一起上楼梯。

“今天天气真好，阳光普照，”我说，“不过，他们说等一会儿会下雨。”

“嗯。”年轻人应道。

到了顶楼，他朝四号公寓走过去，掏出钥匙，开了门。我猛地转身向他跑过去。

“嘿，请问，这是你的吗？掉在地上了。”我手里攥着一张公共汽车周票。车票是两个多月前的，但是他看不到，因为我用手遮住了日期。

他看了眼车票，这时我从开着的四号公寓门朝里看，看到卡丽在屋里。于是我从门口进入公寓。

“哎！”那个年轻人冲我喊，“你干什么？你是谁？出去！”

我转身面对着卡丽。“你好，卡丽，”我说道，“你昨晚给你妈妈发短信了吗？”

这时，那个年轻人走到我旁边。“她到底是 谁？”他问卡丽，“这是怎么回事？”他生气地瞪着我。

卡丽看起来也很生气。“她是个私人侦探。”她告诉那个年轻人说，“我妈妈叫她来的。我昨天在咖啡馆跟她聊过。我告诉过你的，记得吗？”

“噢！”那个年轻人一下子笑了起来。他的笑容很讨人喜欢。“多么令人兴奋！我从没见过私人侦探呢。你好！我叫托马斯·瓦纳斯，很高兴见到你。”

他伸出手来，我们握了握手。名字不对，我心想。不是门上的名字。不过，这的确是 那个立陶宛男朋友。

“雪莉·霍姆斯。我也很高兴见到你。”我说道，“我很抱歉，不过，我得跟你谈谈。卡丽的妈妈……”

“当然可以。”托马斯说，“我理解。请——坐下。要给你来杯咖啡吗？”

他和卡丽冲了咖啡，我们围着桌子坐下来。托马斯看着我，面带笑容。

“那么，”他说，“你想问我一些问题，以便把我的一切情况转告卡丽的妈妈。我很乐意帮忙。你想知道些什么？我可以开始说了吗？”

于是，我听托马斯·瓦纳斯讲了他的故事。他今年19岁，来自立陶宛的维尔纽斯。他六个月前来到伦敦，想自己做生意。他的家人在维尔纽斯生产亚麻布，托马斯想在英国销售布料。目前，他周一到周五在一家医院上班，因为他需要这笔收入。但是他周六会在街头市场上卖亚麻布。生意还不错，而且一周比一周好。

卡丽想告诉我更多情况：“你要知道，是很漂亮的亚麻布。世界上最好的亚麻布。我正在全面了解这方面的知识。”她很兴奋，我从她绿色的眼睛里能看出来。

托马斯露出笑容。“卡丽对亚麻布的颜色感觉很敏锐，”他说道，“她想跟我一起干。而且她对做生意也很在行——非常在行，比我强。”

他的手背碰了碰卡丽的脸颊，只是轻轻一触，非常轻柔，含笑看着她的双眼。她抬头凝望着他，眼里充满爱意。有那么一两秒钟，世界为之静止。这两个年轻人彼此深爱着。

卡丽再次看着我。“你知道，现在人们都想穿亚麻布料的衣服，所以我们的生意会做得更大。”

“要付出很多的努力，”托马斯说道，“不过我们还年轻，我们可以勤奋工作，这一点毫无问题。不过，我们确实面临一个问题，”他看着卡丽，“你的家人。”

“噢，这个啊！”卡丽说道，“这个不重要。我不需要他们。没有他们我们也挺好的。”

“不是这样的，”托马斯温柔地说，“你妈妈不快乐，你弟弟不快乐，你爸爸也不快乐。”

“不，我爸爸不会！我爸爸是个讨厌的家伙！我们总是争吵。他每天都唠叨，‘做这个，别做那个，做这个。’他 永远对，而我 永远错！永远！他从不 听我的想法。他不理解我，他不想理解我。他讨厌 极了……”

“嘘，嘘，”托马斯说，“有时候，当人们生气时，他们说话会很难听。也许他们心里并不那么想。你和你爸爸吵过很多次，你们都在气头上，说了些气话。”

“是的，可是……，”卡丽说道。

我坐在那里倾听。这不是他们第一次争执，也不会是最后一次。听他们争执很有意思。托马斯对卡丽很温柔，但他也很坚决。虽然他在恋爱中，但他的头脑仍然清醒。

“呃，对不起，”我说道，“要知道，我还在这儿呢。”

他们都转向我。托马斯笑着说：“对不起。我们经常讨论这件事。卡丽最终必须回家，她知道这一点。”

“不，我不知道！”卡丽说，“我不会回家的。没门儿！”

“可是，卡丽，你不可能把家人排除在你生活之外。家人非常重要。我的 家人对我很重要。我希望你也有家人……希望你跟你爸爸、你妈妈，还有你弟弟和睦相处。”

他们又开始争执起来。我努力克制，不让自己笑出来。这场争论会无休止地进行下去。我认为托马斯很适合卡丽。

“嗯，我的任务完成了。”我说，“托马斯，见到你很高兴。我现在可以跟威廉斯太太说说你的情况了。还有，呃……祝你们俩好运！”

卡丽笑了。“谢谢你，雪莉。我能叫你雪莉吗？安特和贾尼丝说你人不错。你知道，我昨天晚上给我妈妈发了条短信。”

托马斯也站了起来。“我得回家了，”他说道。

我惊讶地盯着他。“回家？你住这儿，就在这套公寓里，不是吗？”

“不，不，不，”托马斯连声说，“当然不是！卡丽今年15岁。她满16岁之前我们不能结婚，否则是违法的。所以，我当然不住这里。那样是不对的。”

“但这不是你的公寓——？”

“不，不是，”托马斯又连声否认，“这是我姐姐的公寓。卡丽跟我姐姐住在这儿，我姐姐叫鲁塔·瓦内特。她今晚会工作到很晚。我跟一个朋友合住，在帕特尼桥附近。”

我非常惊讶，又坐了下来，看着卡丽。“你为什么不告诉我？每个人都以为你跟托马斯住在一起了。”

卡丽看起来不太高兴。“哼，我又没有告诉他们我跟托马斯住在一起。可是我爸爸总是把事情往最坏的地方想。有时候我妈妈也这样。不过明年等我年满16岁我们就可以结婚了。”

托马斯笑了。他拽了一下卡丽的头发，非常轻柔。“16岁结婚还是太早了。我们可以等。我想先认识你的家人，你也想认识我的家人。”

“是的，我的确想见你的家人，”卡丽说，“但是，你不想见我的家人，你肯定不愿意。”

托马斯又拽了一下她的头发，这次没那么温柔了。“我当然想了。我想跟你爸爸聊天，我想让他喜欢上我。卡丽，我们有的是时间。我们慢慢来，好吗？”

卡丽使劲想绷起脸，但还是笑了。她抱住了托马斯。

我和托马斯一起离开公寓楼。他陪着我走到我的车边。

“我为威廉斯先生感到难过，”他说，“我认为他很爱卡丽。也许有一天我可以跟他见面聊聊。但是，威廉斯太太大可不必为卡丽担心。请告诉她这一点。”

“我会转告她的。”我说。我有很多事要告诉威廉斯太太。托马斯和我再次握手，互相告别。

我开车回到办公室，查看电话留言。萨希德有留言：有关那个立陶宛男朋友的事 ，请给我回电话 。

我给他发了条短信：

找到那个男朋友了，谢谢。

还找到了那个女孩。一切都好，没什么麻烦。

A foot in the door

Saheed and I have a beer together, and I tell him all about the Lithuanian case.

'A father–daughter problem, eh?' says Saheed. 'Well, I know all about difficult fathers.'

Saheed is from an Indian family. He and his sister Leila have their problems with a difficult father too. But Saheed never talks about his problems. He just does his job. He's a good detective.

'So. You did a good job there. A happy ending,' says Saheed.

'Yes, and no,' I say. 'One more thing to do.'

We finish our beer and leave.

'Say hi to Leila for me,' I say. Leila is my best friend. She's a lawyer. Leila, Saheed, and I have a lot of arguments about the law, and the police, and private investigators. We have a good time. I'm always right, of course.

The next day is Saturday. I do some work on my laptop in the office, and think about the Lithuanian case. How many young men are there like Tomas Varnas?

I think about it some more, then I leave, and walk to the Williams' house. It's not far from my office.

Mrs Williams opens the door, sees me, and tries to shut the door again. But my foot is in the door...

But my foot is in the door...

'Can I come in, Mrs Williams?' I say. 'Just for a minute.'

'It's Saturday. My husband's at home,' Edith Williams says. 'Please speak quietly! Look, I've got your money ready– here it is. And thank you, thank you. Carrie is texting me every day now, so I know she's all right. Please go now, please don't—'

'Who's that at the door, Edith?' It's a man's voice, a big strong voice.

'Oh, nobody,' Mrs Williams says quickly, but I'm inside the door now, and looking at Mr Williams.

'Oh, hello,' he says. 'Who are you?'

'Shirley Homes, private investigator. How do you do? Your wife wanted me to find Carrie. And to talk to her boyfriend.'

'What!' Mr Williams turns to his wife. 'What did I say to you, Edith?' he shouts. 'We're finished with that girl! We don't speak to her, we don't talk about her, we—'

'And it's good news, Mr Williams!' I use my head teacher voice again. He's still shouting at his wife, so I shout too. And smile and smile.

'Yes, it's very good news, Mr Williams. Your daughter Carrie is alive and well and living in London. And she has a wonderful boyfriend!'

Mr Williams stops shouting and stares at me. Behind him I can just see Darren's head. He's looking round a door, with big eyes.

'Carrie's boyfriend is a very nice young man. His name is Tomas Varnas, he's nineteen years old, he's a hard worker, he's kind...'

'He's a foreigner,' Mr Williams says angrily.

'You have a problem with foreigners?' I say.

Mrs Williams closes her eyes. She's waiting for something... What? A lot of bad language about foreigners from her husband?

I look at Mr Williams again, but he isn't saying anything. He's just staring at me angrily. And suddenly, I understand. His problem isn't with foreigners, it's with his daughter. He wants to know that Carrie is all right, he wants to hear about her boyfriend, he wants to see her, to have her back home. But he can't find the words. He just can't say it.

I speak quickly. 'Tomas is a very nice young man.' I say it again, it's an important message. 'He works hard, he's doing two jobs, and he's going to make a good life for him and Carrie. He speaks very good English, and he's kind, and he's funny, but he's strong too. He thinks family is important, and he wants Carrie to come back home, to be friends with her mother, her father, her brother...'

All three of them are listening to me now. Darren has a big smile on his face.

'Oh, and Carrie is living with Tomas's sister, not with Tomas, you know. Carrie wants to get married when she's sixteen next year, but Tomas wants to wait. He wants to meet the family, and he wants Carrie to meet his family. So you see – Tomas Varnas is a good man, a really good man. He's a boyfriend to please any father in Britain, Mr Williams.'

Mr Williams is just staring at me angrily.

Carrie's father opens his mouth, and closes it again. He still can't find the words.

'So now you know all about him, Mr Williams. Meet him. Talk to him. Ask him to Sunday lunch.'

I turn to Mrs Williams. 'Do you usually have Sunday lunch, you know, that wonderful British meal? All foreigners love it.'

'Er, yes,' she says. 'I... er... yes, I always do a nice Sunday lunch.'

'Well, there you are then,' I say. I smile around at everybody. 'Sunday lunch. That's a good way to meet your daughter's boyfriend.'

I take my money from Mrs Williams, give Darren a big smile and a wave, and walk to the front door. Nobody's shouting, nobody's crying. So far, so good.

'Have a nice day, everyone!' I say, and close the door behind me.

成功第一步

我和萨希德一起喝啤酒，我把这个立陶宛青年的案子原原本本地告诉了他。

“父女矛盾，对吧？”萨希德说道，“唔，我十分了解难相处的父亲。”

萨希德出生于一个印度家庭。他和姐姐莱拉跟难以取悦的父亲也有矛盾。但萨希德从不讲他这些事，只是工作。他是个优秀的侦探。

“看来，这个案子你办得不错。皆大欢喜的结局。”萨希德说。

“不完全是，”我说，“还有一件事要做。”

我们喝完啤酒，准备回家。

“替我向莱拉问好，”我说。莱拉是我最好的朋友，她是个律师。莱拉、萨希德和我有很多有关法律、警察和私人侦探的争论，争得不亦乐乎，而我当然总是对的。

第二天是星期六。我在办公室用笔记本电脑工作，想起了这个立陶宛青年的案子。如今还有多少像托马斯·瓦纳斯这样的年轻人呢？

我再想了想案子，然后离开办公室，走路去威廉斯家。他们家离我的办公室并不远。

开门的是威廉斯太太，她一看见是我，就要关门。但是，我已经一脚跨进了大门……

“威廉斯太太，我能进来吗？”我说，“我呆一会儿就走。”

“今天是星期六，我丈夫在家。”伊迪丝·威廉斯说，“说话请小声点！看，我已经把给你的钱准备好了——就在这儿。谢谢你，谢谢。卡丽现在每天都给我发短信，所以我知道她没事。现在请你走吧，请不要——”

“伊迪丝，谁在门口？”是个男人的声音，嗓门很大。

“噢，没人，”威廉斯太太连忙回答说，但我已经进了门，看着威廉斯先生。

“哦，你好！”他说，“你是谁？”

“雪莉·霍姆斯，私人侦探。您好！您太太要我去寻找卡丽，并跟她的男朋友谈谈。”

“什么！”威廉斯先生转向他的妻子，“我怎么跟你说的，伊迪丝？”他咆哮着，“我们跟那个丫头一刀两断了！我们不跟她说话，我们不谈她，我们……”

“是好消息，威廉斯先生！”我又用校长的腔调说话。他还在冲他太太嚷嚷，所以我也提高了嗓门，连连微笑。

“一点没错，是个好消息，威廉斯先生。您的女儿卡丽还活着，一切都好，住在伦敦。而且她还有一个非常不错的男朋友。”

威廉斯先生停止吼叫，盯着我。在他身后，我正好看见达伦的脑袋。他从门边张望，瞪大了双眼。

“卡丽的男朋友是个非常棒的小伙子。他的名字叫托马斯·瓦纳斯，今年19岁。他工作非常努力，人也很好……”

“他是个外国人。”威廉斯先生气呼呼地说。

“你对外国人有看法？”我问道。

威廉斯太太闭上了眼睛。她在等待着什么……等待什么？等待她丈夫说出一大堆关于外国人的坏话？

我又看着威廉斯先生，但他一言不发。他只是怒气冲冲地盯着我。一刹那间，我明白了。他的问题不在于外国人，而在于他的女儿。他想 知道卡丽没事，他想 了解她男朋友的情况，他想 见她，想让她回家。但是他不知道该怎么说。他根本无法开口。

我立刻说：“托马斯是个很不错的小伙子。”我又重复了一遍，这个信息很重要。“他工作很努力，同时干两份工作，他想让自己和卡丽过上好日子。他英语说得很好，而且心地善良、说话风趣，但是也非常坚定。他认为家庭很重要，所以希望卡丽能回家，跟母亲、父亲和弟弟和睦相处……”

此刻，一家三口都在听我说。达伦眉开眼笑。

“哦，还有，卡丽住在托马斯的姐姐那儿，你要知道，她没跟托马斯住在一起。卡丽想等她明年满了16岁以后就结婚，但是托马斯想再等等。他想见卡丽的家人，也想让卡丽与他的家人见面。所以，你看，托马斯·瓦纳斯是个好小伙，一个真正的好男人。威廉斯先生，他这样的男朋友，任何一个英国女孩的父亲都会喜欢。”

卡丽的父亲张了张嘴想说什么，又闭上了。他仍然找不到合适的话说。

“威廉斯先生，现在你已经了解他所有的情况了。见见他吧，跟他聊聊。邀请他星期天中午来吃饭。”

我转身跟威廉斯太太说：“你们有吃星期天午餐吗？就是那种美味的英式大餐？所有的外国人都喜欢吃。”

“呃，有，”她说，“我……呃……是的，我经常做丰盛的星期天午餐。”

“唔，那么就这样定了。”我说。我冲每个人笑了笑。“星期天午餐，这是认识你女儿男朋友的好方式。”

我从威廉斯太太那儿拿了钱，开心地冲着达伦笑了笑，挥了挥手，向前门走去。没有人吼叫，没有人哭泣。到目前为止，一切顺利。

“各位，祝你们愉快！”我说着，转身关上了门。

A surprise visitor

The next three weeks are busy. I have a new case to work on, and I'm out of the office nearly every day. I don't like the client very much, but the case is an interesting one.

On Saturday morning I'm in the office again. I have a lot of emails to write, so I'm not pleased when my doorbell rings.

The computer screen shows me a man at the door. Well, well, well, what a surprise! I hit the 'open door' button, and the man comes in.

'Mr Williams, good morning. How are you?' I say. What does he want?

'Morning, Ms Homes.' He's not friendly, he's not unfriendly. He looks around my little room.

'Nice office,' he says. 'Can you see the river from your window?' He walks to the window, looks out. What does he want? Does he just want to talk about my office? Maybe the weather's next...

'It's colder today,' he says. 'Autumn's coming.'

I wait.

He comes away from the window. 'Can I sit down? Just for a minute.'

'Of course. Please,' I say.

Now he looks at me. 'I just wanted to say... Well, you were right about Tomas Varnas. He's a fine young man. I like him a lot.'

I hit the 'open door' button, and the man comes in.

'Well, that's great, Mr Williams. I'm very pleased. So, tell me. What happened?'

He smiles, and gets comfortable in my best chair. He wants to tell me all about it.

'We asked him to Sunday lunch. Like you said. And he and Carrie came to lunch, and stayed all day. Lots to talk about.' He laughs. 'Me and Carrie have an argument, of course, but we always do. Tom – I call him Tom now, you see – is very good for Carrie. He doesn't get excited, and angry, like Carrie does. And Carrie listens to him.' He laughs again. 'She never listens to me!'

I smile, and say something about the father–daughter thing.

'So Carrie's back home with us now. Tom comes round every evening, of course. And weekends. He's out with Darren now, playing football. Darren thinks he's wonderful!'

'Tomas is a big brother for Darren,' I say.

'That's right,' says Mr Williams. 'Oh, and Carrie's back at school too. She wants to do business studies, then she can help Tom with his linen business. She's got a good head for business, you know.' He laughs. 'My little Carrie – a businesswoman!'

He stands up. 'Well, you're busy, I can see that. I just wanted to tell you about Tom.'

'I like good news, Mr Williams,' I say. 'And it was good of you to come.' I walk with him to the door.

'We asked Tomas to Sunday lunch.'

At the door, he says, 'You helped my family a lot. Maybe one day you need help. Just call me.' He gives me his business card. 'Anything. Who knows?'

Who knows? I'm going to remember those words...

不速之客

接下来的三个星期我都很忙。我忙着处理一个新案子，几乎每天都在办公室外奔波。我不太喜欢那个客户，可是这个案子本身很吸引我。

一个星期六的早晨，我又回到了办公室。我要写一大堆邮件，所以当门铃响起时，我有些不快。

通过电脑屏幕，我看到一个男人站在门口。哇、哇、哇，真是太意外了！我敲了一下“开门”按钮，那个男人走了进来。

“威廉斯先生，早上好！你好吗？”我说。他想要干什么？

“早上好，霍姆斯小姐。”他看起来不是很可亲，但也不能说不友善。他四下打量着我的小办公室。

“办公室不错，”他开口说道，“从窗户这儿能看到河吗？”他走到窗边，望着窗外。他想干什么 ？难道他只是想谈谈我的办公室？也许接下来会聊聊天气……

“今天降温了，”他接着说道，“秋天到了。”

我等待着。

他离开窗户。“我能坐下吗？就一会儿。”

“当然可以，请坐。”我说。

这时，他直视着我。“我只是想说……嗯，你介绍的托马斯·瓦纳斯的情况没错。他是个优秀的青年。我非常喜欢他。”

“噢，好极了，威廉斯先生。我非常高兴。那么，告诉我，发生什么事了？”

他露出笑容，坐在我最好的椅子上，放松下来。他想把一切都告诉我。

“我们邀请他来吃星期天午餐，就像你说的那样。他和卡丽都来了，呆了一天。我们谈了很多。”他笑着说，“当然了，我和卡丽又争吵起来，不过我们一向如此。汤姆——你瞧，现在我叫他汤姆——很适合卡丽。他不像卡丽那样容易激动或生气，而且卡丽又听他的。”他又笑起来。“她从来不听我的！”

我笑了，跟他说了些父女关系的事。

“所以现在卡丽搬回家跟我们一起住了。汤姆自然每天晚上都会来。还有周末。他现在带着达伦出去了，在踢足球。达伦觉得他非常好。”

“托马斯对达伦来说是个大哥哥。”我说。

“的确如此。”威廉斯先生说，“对了，卡丽也回学校上学了。她想读商科，那样她就可以帮助汤姆经营亚麻布生意了。你知道，她很有经商的头脑。”他脸上露出笑容，“我的小卡丽——一个女商人！”

他站起来。“好了，我能看出来你很忙。我只是想跟你说说汤姆。”

“我喜欢好消息，威廉斯先生。”我说，“你能来告诉我这些真是太好了。”我陪他一起走到门边。

站在门口，他说：“你给我们家帮了大忙。说不定哪天你也需要帮助，那就只管给我打电话。”他递给我他的名片，“任何事都可以给我电话。谁知道呢？”

谁知道呢？我会记住这句话的……

内容简介


生活中有时候会有些奇怪的事情发生，没人能解释为什么。一扇门在夜里开了，却见不到人。一只冰冷的手掐住了你的脖子，你身边却没有人，天气也很暖和。你进了一间房子，里面都是人。你看不到他们，却能感受到他们的存在，他们在黑暗中等待。

罗达是农场里的工人。她高高的个子，有一双美丽的黑眼睛，每天工作很长时间，挣得却不多。格特鲁德不工作。她很漂亮，有一双小巧白皙的手，一副甜美的笑容，还有许多美丽的裙子。洛奇先生是农场主，拥有一栋很大的农舍，一座富庶的农场和很多良种奶牛。两个女人中哪个是洛奇农场主的妻子？农场主过去爱谁，现在爱谁，谁又是他儿子的母亲？

上面这些人里谁有一条萎缩的胳膊？一条可怜的、细细的、萎缩的胳膊，一条留有手指印迹的胳膊，一条一周周愈加纤瘦、枯槁的胳膊。胳膊上的印迹是从哪里来的？没人知道，也没人能解释。但人们都说，那是女巫留下的……

（本书属于哈代的非现实题材小说）

THE WITHERED ARM

Sometimes strange things happen, and nobody can explain why. A door opens in the night, but there is nobody there. A cold hand takes you by the neck, but you are alone, and it is a warm day. You go into a house, and it is full of people. You cannot see them, but you can feel them there, waiting in the dark.

Rhoda is a farm worker. She is tall, with beautiful dark eyes, and works long hours for not much money. Gertrude does not work. She is pretty, has small white hands, a sweet smile, and beautiful dresses. Mr Lodge is a farmer, with a big farmhouse, and many fine cows on his rich farm. Which of the two women is the wife of Farmer Lodge? Which woman did he love, which woman does he love, which woman is the mother of his son?

And which of these people has a withered arm? A poor, thin, withered arm, an arm with the marks of fingers on it, an arm that grows thinner and more withered, week by week. How did those marks get there? Nobody knows, nobody can explain them. But people say they are a witch's marks...

The milkmaid and the wife

It was six o'clock on a warm April evening, milking time for Farmer Lodge's eighty cows. They stood quietly in the dairy, and the milkmaids were all at work.

'They say Farmer Lodge is coming home with his new wife tomorrow,' said one milkmaid.

'Yes. And she's young and pretty, I hear,' a second girl said.

She looked past her cow to the other end of the dairy. There was another milkmaid there, a thin, older woman, about thirty years old.

The first girl looked at the older woman too. 'I'm sorry for her ,' she said quietly to her friend.

'I'm sorry for her,' the milkmaid said to her friend.

'Oh no,' said the second girl. 'That was years and years ago. Farmer Lodge never speaks to Rhoda Brook these days.'

When the milking was finished, the milkmaids left the dairy and went home. The thin woman, Rhoda Brook, did not walk to the village with the other girls. She went up the hill behind the farm to a little house near the trees. It was a poor house, of only two rooms, and the roof did not keep the rain out.

At the door of the house the woman met her son, a boy of about twelve, and they went inside.

'I heard something at the dairy today,' the woman said. 'Your father is bringing his young wife home tomorrow. I want you to go and look at her.'

'Yes, mother,' said the boy. 'Is father married then?'

'Yes... You can go into town and do my shopping for me. And when you see her, there or on the road, look at her carefully.'

'Yes, mother.'

'What is she like? I want to know. Is she tall, is she short? Are her eyes blue or brown or green? Look at the colour of her hair, the colour of her dress. And look at her hands. Does she have small white hands, or the hands of a milkmaid, a worker's hands? You must look at all these things, and tell me.'

'Yes, mother,' the boy said again. He took a piece of bread from the table and began to eat it.

His mother said nothing more, but turned her thin, pale face to the open door. Her beautiful dark eyes stared out at the trees, seeing and not seeing.

The next evening was warm and sunny. The road from the town to the farm went up and down a number of hills, and near the top of one big hill the boy saw a carriage behind him. It was Farmer Lodge with his new wife. She was a pretty young thing, much younger than her husband, with a sweet, innocent face.

The boy carried a heavy bag, and was happy to stop and stare for a minute. The carriage came slowly up the hill, and the boy took a good long look at the farmer's wife. His eyes never left her face.

The boy took a good long look at the farmer's wife.

The farmer did not look at the boy once, and at the top of the hill the carriage went faster, leaving the boy behind.

'How that poor boy stared at me!' said the young wife.

'Yes, my love. I saw that,' the farmer said.

'Is he a boy from the village?'

'No. I think he lives with his mother on one of these hills.'

'He knows you, then.'

'Of course. And everyone is going to stare at you at first, my pretty Gertrude.'

'Yes, I know. But that poor boy had a very heavy bag. Perhaps he wanted us to help him with the bag.'

'Oh, these country boys can carry anything,' said her husband. 'They do it all the time.'

The carriage went quickly on. After a time the boy left the road and went up the hill to his mother's house.

She was home before him. She took the heavy bag from him and began to take the things out.

'Well, did you see her?'

'Yes. I had a good look at her on the road.'

'And what is she like?'

'She's nice.'

'Is she young?'

'Well, she's older than me.'

'Of course she is. But is she older than me ?'

'No, she's younger.'

'Ah. What colour is her hair?'

'It's a brown colour, and her face is very pretty.'

'Are her eyes dark?'

'No, they're blue, and her mouth is very nice and red, and when she smiles, you can see white teeth.'

'Is she tall?' said the woman, a little angrily.

'I couldn't see. She was in the carriage.'

'Then tomorrow you must go to church. Go early, before she and Mr Lodge arrive, and watch her when she walks in. Then come home and tell me.'

'Very well, mother. But why don't you go and look at her?'

'Never! I don't want to see her. She was with Mr Lodge, of course. Did he look at you or speak to you?'

'No.'

The next day the boy went to church, and waited and watched. When Mr and Mrs Lodge arrived, everybody – not just the boy – stared at the new wife with interest.

When the boy reached home, his mother said, 'Well?'

'She's not tall. She's short,' the boy said.

'Ah!' said his mother, pleased.

'But she's very pretty – very. She had a beautiful white dress on, and it made a lot of noise when she moved. Mr Lodge looked very happy with her.'

'Mr Lodge looked very happy with her,' the boy said.

'No more now,' said the woman. 'You can tell me more later.'

In the next days, Rhoda Brook heard more and more from her son about the new wife. The boy often saw Mrs Lodge around the farmhouse, but his mother never saw her, and never went near the farmhouse.

At the dairy the other milkmaids talked a lot about the new wife. They usually stopped when Rhoda was near, but she heard some of it. She remembered everything, and forgot nothing.

And slowly Rhoda Brook made a picture in her head of the young Mrs Lodge – a picture as good, as true as a photograph.

挤奶女工和夫人

这是个温暖的四月傍晚，六点钟是给洛奇农场主的80头奶牛挤奶的时间。奶牛们静静地站在棚中，挤奶女工们都在忙活。

“听说洛奇场主明天要跟他的新夫人回家来了。”其中一个挤奶女工说。

“是的。而且我听说她又年轻又漂亮。”另一个女孩儿说。

她的目光越过眼前的奶牛，望向奶牛场的另一头。那边还有一个挤奶女工，瘦瘦的，年龄稍大，三十岁上下。

第一个说话的女孩儿也在望着那个年纪大些的女工。“我真替她 难过。”她悄悄地跟自己的同伴说。

“嗐，算啦，”第二个女孩儿说，“那都是多少年前的事了。现在洛奇场主从来不跟罗达·布鲁克说话。”

挤奶工作结束后，女工们离开奶牛场回家了。那个瘦瘦的女人罗达·布鲁克没有跟其他女孩儿一起走回村子。她走上农场后面的小山，来到树旁的一幢小房子跟前。房子很破旧，只有两间屋，屋顶已经遮不了雨。

女人在门口碰到了她12岁上下的儿子，两人一起进了屋。

“我今天在奶牛场听说了件事情。”女人说，“你爸爸明天要带着他年轻的妻子回家来了。我想让你去看看她。”

“好的，妈妈。”男孩儿说，“这么说爸爸是结婚了？”

“是啊……你可以到镇子上去，替我买点儿东西。在镇子上或是路上碰到她时，仔细看看她。”

“好的，妈妈。”

“我想知道她长什么样儿。高还是矮？眼睛是蓝色的、棕色的，还是绿色的？看看她头发的颜色，裙子的颜色。再看看她的手，看她长了一双小巧白皙的手，还是一双挤奶女工的、劳动的手？这些都要看看，然后告诉我。”

“好的，妈妈。”男孩儿再次答应。他从桌上拿起一片面包，吃了起来。

他的母亲没再说别的，只是把她瘦削苍白的脸转向敞开着的门。她美丽的黑眼睛凝望着门外的树木，似乎在看，又似乎没在看。

第二天傍晚，天气晴朗又暖和。从镇子到农场的路要上上下下翻过几座山。在快走到一个高高坡顶的时候，男孩儿看到他身后有一辆马车。车里坐的是洛奇农场主和他的新婚妻子。那女人很年轻，比她丈夫年轻得多，面容甜美无邪。

男孩儿背着沉重的包，很高兴能停下来看上一会儿。马车缓缓地爬上山来，让他有机会好好端详了一番农场主的妻子。他的眼睛一直盯着她的脸。

农场主看都没看男孩儿一眼。到了山顶以后，马车加快了速度，男孩儿被甩在了后面。

“那个可怜的男孩儿怎么那样盯着我！”年轻的妻子说。

“哦，亲爱的，我看到了。”农场主说。

“他是村子里面的孩子吗？”

“不是。我想他跟他妈妈一起住在这里的某座小山上。”

“那他认识你啦。”

“当然认识。谁第一次见到你都会盯着你看的，我美丽的格特鲁德。”

“是，这我知道。可是那可怜的孩子背着那么重的包，说不定他是想让我们帮他带一程呢。”

“放心吧，这些乡下的男孩子什么都扛得动。”她的丈夫说，“他们整天都在做这些活儿。”

马车继续向前疾驰。过了一会儿，男孩儿离开了大路，走上小山，回到了母亲的房子。

他母亲比他先到了家。她从孩子肩上取下沉重的包，开始把里面的东西往外拿。

“我说，你见到她了吗？”

“见到了。我在路上好好瞅了瞅她。”

“她长什么样儿？”

“挺好看的。”

“年轻吗？”

“哦，至少比我大。”

“她当然比你要大。我是问她比我 大吗？”

“不，比你年轻。”

“哦。她的头发是什么颜色的？”

“是棕色的。她长得非常好看。”

“她的眼睛是黑色的吗？”

“不是，是蓝色的。她的嘴巴很漂亮，红红的，一笑起来就露出白白的牙齿。”

“她个子高吗？”女人问，语气有些气恼。

“我看不出来。她坐在马车里。”

“那你明天得去趟教堂。早早地去，抢在她和洛奇先生之前到那儿，等她走进来的时候看看她，然后回来告诉我。”

“完全可以，妈妈。可是为什么你 不去看看她呢？”

“我不去！我不想见到她。她刚才肯定是跟洛奇先生在一起的。洛奇先生看你了吗？跟你说什么了吗？”

“没有。”

第二天，男孩儿去了教堂，边等边张望。当洛奇夫妇到达的时候，每个人——不仅仅是男孩儿——都饶有兴致地盯着那位新夫人。

等男孩儿回到家里，他母亲问：“怎么样？”

“她个子不高，挺矮的。”男孩儿说。

“哦！”他母亲开心了一点儿。

“可是她非常漂亮——非常。她穿了一条好看的白裙子，一动就窸窸窣窣地响。洛奇先生跟她在一起看起来非常幸福。”

“就说到这儿吧！”女人说，“你改天再跟我说其他的。”

接下来的几天里，罗达·布鲁克从儿子那里听到了越来越多关于那位新夫人的情况。男孩儿经常在农舍附近看到洛奇夫人，但他母亲从来没见过她，也从来不去农舍附近。

在奶牛场，其他的挤奶女工经常谈论这位新夫人。罗达在附近的时候，她们通常会停住不说，可罗达还是听到了些只言片语。她把听到的话都记在了脑子里，一句都没忘掉。

慢慢地，罗达·布鲁克在她的头脑中勾画出了一幅年轻的洛奇夫人的画像——一幅跟照片一样真实、生动的画像。

The dream

One night, two or three weeks later, when the boy was in bed, Rhoda Brook sat by the dying fire in her little house. She stared at the fire for a long time, but she saw only the picture in her head of the new wife. At last, tired from her day's work, she went to bed.

But the picture of Gertrude Lodge did not go away. When Rhoda slept, the young wife was still there in Rhoda's dreams. She sat on Rhoda's body in the bed, staring into Rhoda's face. Her blue eyes were cold, and with a cruel laugh, she put her left hand in front of Rhoda's eyes. There, on the third finger, was her wedding-ring. And the phantom of Gertrude Lodge laughed again.

Rhoda turned this way and that way, but the phantom was still there. It sat, heavier and heavier, on Rhoda's body, and now Rhoda could not move. Always in her ears was that cruel laugh, and always in front of her eyes was that left hand with its wedding-ring.

Always in her ears was that cruel laugh, and always in front of her eyes was that left hand with its wedding-ring.

At last, half-dead with terror, Rhoda suddenly put out her right hand, took hold of the phantom's left arm, and pulled it hard.

The phantom fell off the bed onto the floor, and Rhoda sat up.

'Dear God!' she cried. She felt cold, so cold. 'That was not a dream – she was here!'

She could still feel the young woman's arm under her hand – a warm, living arm. She looked on the floor for the woman's body, but there was nothing there.

Rhoda Brook slept no more that night, and at the dairy early the next morning, she looked pale and ill. She could not forget the feel of that arm under her hand.

When she came home for breakfast, her son asked her,'What was that noise in your room last night, mother? Did you fall off the bed?'

'Noise? What time did you hear it?'

'About two o'clock. But what was it, mother? Something fell, I heard it. Was it you?'

Rhoda did not answer, and after breakfast she began to do her work in the house. At about midday she heard something, and looked out of the window. At the bottom of the garden stood a woman – the woman from her dream. Rhoda stood still, and stared.

The boy came to look out of the window too.

'Oh, there's Mrs Lodge,' he said. 'She told me—'

'Told you?' said his mother. She looked angry. 'Why did you speak to her? I told you not to.'

'She spoke to me first. I met her in the road.'

'When was this?'

'Yesterday.'

'What did you tell her?'

'Nothing. She began to talk to me, and then she saw my old shoes. She said, "Do they keep the rain out?" And I said, "No, they don't, but mother and I have no money for new shoes." Then she said, "I can give you some better shoes." She's bringing them now, I think. Perhaps they're in her bag. She's very nice, mother – she gives things to lots of people.'

By now Mrs Lodge was at the door. Rhoda wanted to run away, but there was no back door in her little house. So she waited, and the boy ran to open the door.

The boy ran to open the door.

'This is the right house then,' said Mrs Lodge, smiling at the boy. 'And this is your mother, is it?'

The face and body were the same as those of the phantom in Rhoda's dream, but there was nothing cruel in this face. The blue eyes were warm, and the smile was sweet and kind.

The young woman took the shoes out of her bag, and gave them to the boy. She smiled and talked in a warm and friendly way.

'How kind she is!' thought Rhoda. 'How young and sweet and innocent! Why did I have that bad dream about her? She's a friend, not an enemy.'

Two days later Mrs Lodge came again, with a new shirt for the boy, and twelve days after that she visited Rhoda a third time. The boy was out that day.

'I like walking up here on the hill,' Mrs Lodge told Rhoda. 'And your house is the only one up here.'

They talked about the weather and the village, then Mrs Lodge got up to leave. 'Are you well, Rhoda?' she asked. 'You look pale.'

'Oh, I'm always pale,' said Rhoda. 'But what about you, Mrs Lodge? Are you well?'

'Yes, I am, but... there is something... It's nothing very bad, but I don't understand it.'

'There is something... It's nothing very bad, but I don't understand it,' said Mrs Lodge.

She uncovered her left hand and arm. There were marks on the arm, yellowy-brown marks, like marks made by fingers. Rhoda stared at them.

'How did it happen?' she asked.

'I don't know,' said Mrs Lodge. 'One night, when I was in bed, I had a dream... and then suddenly, my arm hurt very badly. Perhaps I hit it on something in the daytime, but I don't remember it.' She laughed. 'My dear husband says it's nothing very much, and he's right, of course.'

'Yes... Which night was that?' said Rhoda.

Mrs Lodge thought for a moment. 'It was two weeks ago today. It was two o'clock in the night – I remember, because I heard the clock.'

It was the same night, the same hour, as Rhoda's dream of the phantom. Rhoda remembered the terror of it, and felt cold.

'How can this be?' she thought, when Mrs Lodge left. 'Did I do that? But why? She is innocent and kind – I don't want to hurt her. And how can a thing like that happen? Only witches can do things like that...'

梦

两三周后的一天夜里，男孩儿睡下以后，罗达·布鲁克坐在她那小房子里即将熄灭的炉火旁。她朝炉火望了很长时间，脑子里却只有那位新夫人的影像。最后，累了一天的她终于上床入睡了。

可是格特鲁德·洛奇的影像却没有离去。罗达睡着之后，那位年轻夫人又出现在她的梦中。她来到床边，坐在罗达身上，死死盯着罗达的脸。她蓝色的眼睛冷冰冰的，残忍地笑着，并把左手伸到罗达眼前。那只手的无名指上，戴着她的结婚戒指。接着，格特鲁德·洛奇的幻影再一次笑了起来。

罗达辗转反侧，可幻影一直挥之不去。它坐在罗达身上，越来越重，现在罗达已经动弹不得了。她的耳朵里灌满了那残忍的笑声，眼前一直晃动着那只戴着结婚戒指的左手。

终于，吓得半死的罗达猛地伸出右手，抓住了幻影的左臂，用力一拉。

幻影从床上摔到地板上，罗达也坐了起来。

“天啊！”她叫道。她感到冷，特别冷。“这不是梦——她刚才就在这儿！”

她仍能感受到那年轻女人的胳膊握在她的手中——那是一只温热的、活生生的胳膊。她望向地板，寻找那女人的身体，但地上什么都没有。

那天夜里，罗达·布鲁克再也睡不着了。第二天一大早在奶牛场里，她看起来面色苍白，病恹恹的。她忘不了手中抓着那只胳膊的感觉。

回家吃早饭的时候，儿子问她：“妈妈，昨天夜里你屋子里的响动是怎么回事？是你从床上掉下来了吗？”

“响动？你什么时候听到的？”

“大概两点钟。到底是怎么回事，妈妈？什么东西掉下来了，我听到了。是你吗？”

罗达没有回答。吃过早饭，她开始做家务。大约正午时分，她听到有声音，就向窗外望了望。有个女人站在花园的尽头——正是她梦里的女人。罗达动也不动地站着，注视着她。

男孩儿也凑过来，向窗外望去。

“哦，那是洛奇夫人。”他说，“她跟我说——”

“她跟你说？”他母亲说。她看上去生气了。“你为什么跟她说话？我告诉过你不要跟她说话的。”

“是她先跟我说话的。我在路上碰到她来着。”

“什么时候？”

“昨天。”

“你跟她说什么了？”

“没说什么。她跟我聊起天来，后来看到我的旧鞋子，就问：‘这鞋能挡雨吗？’我说：‘不行，挡不了。可我和妈妈没钱买新鞋子。’然后她说：‘我可以给你双好点儿的鞋子。’我想她现在是把鞋子带来了，可能就在她的袋子里。她人很好，妈妈——她给很多人送过东西。”

这时候，洛奇夫人已来到了门前。罗达想跑掉，可她家的小房子没有后门，她只得等在那里。男孩儿跑去开门。

“看来就是这座房子啦。”洛奇夫人冲男孩儿微笑着说，“这是你妈妈，对吗？”

这面容，这身材，跟罗达梦里的幻影一模一样，只是她的脸上没有半点儿残忍的样子。她那蓝色的眼睛里流露着温暖，她的微笑甜美又善良。

年轻女人从包里拿出鞋子，递给了男孩儿。她微笑着，说话的语气温和而友善。

“多好的一个人啊！”罗达心想，“那么年轻，那么可爱，那么纯真！为什么我会做那个关于她的噩梦？她是朋友，不是敌人啊。”

两天之后，洛奇夫人又给男孩儿送来一件新衬衫。十二天之后，她第三次造访了罗达的家。男孩儿那天没在家。

“我喜欢走到山坡上来。”洛奇夫人对罗达说，“而你家是这地方唯一的房子。”

她们聊了聊天气和村里的事，之后洛奇夫人起身告辞。“你身体好吗，罗达？”她问，“你的脸色看起来很苍白。”

“哦，我脸色总是苍白的。”罗达说，“您呢，洛奇夫人？您身体好吗？”

“我还好，只不过……有点儿……不是什么很严重的问题，可我不明白是怎么回事。”

她挽起衣袖，露出左手和左臂。她的胳膊上有一些黄褐色的印迹，像是被手指抓过似的。罗达盯着这些印迹。

“这是怎么回事？”她问。

“我不知道。”洛奇夫人说。“一天夜里，我睡觉的时候做了一个梦……接着，我的胳膊突然就疼得厉害。或许我白天撞到了什么东西，自己没察觉。”她笑着说，“我亲爱的丈夫说没什么大不了的，我肯定他说得对。”

“对，没事……这是哪天夜里的事？”罗达问。

洛奇夫人想了一会儿。“两周以前的今天。时间是夜里两点——我记得，因为我听到了钟声。”

这件事发生在罗达梦到幻影的同一天夜里，同一个时间。罗达记起了那可怕的梦，感到浑身发冷。

“怎么会这样？”洛奇夫人离开后，她想，“确实是我做的吗？可这是为什么？她那么纯真，那么善良——我不想伤害她。怎么会发生这样的事情？这种事只有女巫才可以做到啊……”

The face in the glass

The days went past, and Rhoda Brook was afraid to meet Mrs Lodge again. She liked her, and did not want to remember the strange dream or the strange marks on the young wife's arm. But she could not stop thinking about them.

One day they met on the road from the village. They began to talk, and after a minute or two Rhoda said, 'How is your arm, Mrs Lodge? Is it better now?'

'No, it isn't. It's worse than before. Sometimes it hurts very badly.'

'What does the doctor say about it?' asked Rhoda.

'He doesn't understand it. He just says, "Put the arm in hot water for five minutes twice a day." Well, I do that, but it doesn't help.'

'Can I look at your arm?' asked Rhoda.

Once again, the younger woman uncovered her arm, and Rhoda stared at it.

The arm was thinner, and a little withered. And the marks looked more and more like marks made by fingers. Rhoda remembered her dream, and the feel of the arm under her hand – in just the same place.

'It looks like the marks of fingers,' Gertrude Lodge said. She tried to laugh. 'My husband says they are a witch's marks. A witch put her hand on my arm, he says, and it's killing the flesh.'

'No, no,' said Rhoda quickly. She felt cold and afraid. 'Don't listen to those old stories.'

The young wife's face was unhappy. 'No, but... you see, I think he begins to... to love me less, because of these marks on my arm. Men always like their wives to be pretty, don't they?'

'Some men do,' said Rhoda. 'But don't show him the arm. Cover it all the time, and then he can't see it.'

'Ah, but he knows the marks are there.' Gertrude looked away, but Rhoda could see the tears in her eyes.

'I hope your arm is better soon, Mrs Lodge,' she said quietly.

She said goodbye and began to walk home. She felt sorry for the poor, innocent young wife, and did not want to hurt her. But she did not feel sorry for the husband. She walked home, thinking about him. 'So, Farmer Lodge,' she thought.'You loved me once, but then you left me, and did nothing to help me. You wanted a new, younger and prettier woman for your wife. But she is not so pretty now, is she?'

The next day Rhoda walked home from the dairy after evening milking at the usual time. She was nearly at her house when she saw Gertrude Lodge behind her. Rhoda went down the hill to meet her.

'Oh, Rhoda!' called Gertrude. 'I wanted to see you – to ask you...' Her face was pale and worried, and she held her left arm with her other hand. 'Somebody told me,' she said, 'about a man at Egdon Heath. They don't know his name, but they say he is a famous Wise Man, and can help people with... with things like this.'

Rhoda could see the tears in her eyes.

She looked down at her left arm, and then looked at Rhoda, with hope in her eyes. 'They say you know about him, this Wise Man. Do you know his name?'

'Perhaps they mean Mr Trendle,' Rhoda said slowly. She felt ill. This man Trendle, people said, could do many strange things. He could understand dreams, he could drive phantoms out of houses, he could stop the work of witches... 'I am not a witch,' she thought. 'I am not ! I do not believe in these things.'

Gertrude watched her. 'You know him,' she said. 'I can see it in your face. Of course, I don't believe in Wise Men. What can they do? But... well, I can just go and see him. Is it far to his house?'

'Yes – about five miles,' said Rhoda.

'Well, I must walk there. I cannot tell my husband about this. Can you come with me, Rhoda, to show me the way? Perhaps tomorrow afternoon?'

'Oh no, it's... I...' Rhoda began.

'Please!' said Gertrude.

And in the end Rhoda could not say no. Mrs Lodge was good and kind, and she needed a friend's help. But perhaps a Wise Man could see into people's dreams. Rhoda did not want to meet this man Trendle, and she was afraid...

The next afternoon she met Gertrude by the trees near her house, and they began the long walk across the hills to Egdon Heath. It was a cold day, and the sky above the hills was dark and unfriendly.

They found Mr Trendle's house outside the village. He was at home when they arrived. He was an old man with grey hair, and he looked long and hard at Rhoda when he saw her. Mrs Lodge told him about her arm, and he looked at it carefully.

'No, doctors can't do anything for this,' he said. 'This is the work of an enemy.'

Rhoda moved away a little.

'An enemy? What enemy?' asked Mrs Lodge.

'I don't know,' said the Wise Man, looking at her. 'But perhaps you do. I can show the person to you. Do you want me to do that?'

'Yes,' said Gertrude. 'Yes, please show me.'

Mr Trendle took Gertrude into another room, but the door was open, and Rhoda could see into the room.

The Wise Man took an egg, and did something to it. Then he put a glass of water on the table, and carefully broke the egg open. The white of the egg went down into the water, changing to a milky white colour, and moving slowly round and round.

He put the glass in front of Gertrude. 'Look down into the water,' he said. 'Look for a face.'

'Look down into the water. Look for a face.'

Gertrude stared down into the water.

'Do you see a face?' the Wise Man asked quietly.

Gertrude whispered something, but Rhoda could not hear. She turned away from the door.

When Mrs Lodge came out, her face was pale – paler than Rhoda's. Mr Trendle closed the door behind her, and the two women began to walk home. But things were not the same between them.

'Did he – did he ask for money?' Rhoda said quietly.

'Oh no, nothing. He did not want a penny,' said Gertrude.

'And what did you see?' asked Rhoda.

'Nothing... I – I don't want to speak about it.'

Gertrude did not look at Rhoda. Her pretty young face looked ten years older, and was now more like the face of the phantom in Rhoda's dream.

They did not speak for a long time, then Gertrude said suddenly, 'Did you want me to come here and see this Wise Man? How strange of you!'

'No, I didn't. But now, I am not sorry we came.'

For the first time since her dream Rhoda felt a little pleased. Life was cruel, she thought, and Gertrude Lodge must learn that lesson too.

On the long walk home they did not speak again about their visit to the Wise Man. But other people did, and whispered stories about it in all the farms and dairies. Mrs Lodge could no longer use her withered arm to do anything, and people began to put the word 'witch' in front of the name 'Rhoda Brook'.

Rhoda said nothing to anybody about the phantom of her dream, but her face got thinner and paler. And in the spring she and her boy left their house and went away into the hills in the west.

They went away into the hills in the west.

玻璃杯中的面孔

日子一天天过去，罗达·布鲁克害怕再次见到洛奇夫人。她喜欢洛奇夫人，不想回忆那个奇怪的梦，还有年轻夫人胳膊上奇怪的印迹。可是她没办法不去想。

有一天，她们在从村子过来的路上相遇了。两人交谈了一两分钟后，罗达问：“洛奇夫人，您的胳膊怎么样了？好些了吗？”

“没有。比以前更严重了。有时候疼得厉害。”

“大夫怎么说呢？”罗达问。

“大夫也说不清楚，只是说：'把胳膊放进热水里泡，每天两次，每次五分钟。'唉，我照做了，可是没什么用。”

“我能看看您的胳膊吗？”罗达问。

年轻的夫人再次挽起衣袖，露出胳膊，罗达仔细地看了看。

胳膊变细了，有些萎缩。那些印迹越来越像手指抓过的痕迹。罗达记得她的梦，记得手中抓着那只胳膊的感觉——就在同一个位置。

“看起来像手指印。”格特鲁德·洛奇说。她努力想笑一笑。“我丈夫说这是女巫留下的印迹。他说有个女巫用手碰过我的胳膊，所以上面的肉慢慢萎缩了。”

“不，不。”罗达急忙说。她感到又冷又怕。“不要听信那些老掉牙的传说。”

年轻夫人满脸愁苦：“我没有，可是……你知道吗，我想他开始……开始不那么爱我了，因为胳膊上的这些印迹。男人们都希望他们的妻子漂漂亮亮的，不是吗？”

“有些男人的确是这样。”罗达说，“不过别给他看您的胳膊呀。一直把胳膊盖着，他就看不到了。”

“嗯，但他知道那些印迹还在。”格特鲁德把目光移开，可罗达看得到她眼中的泪。

“希望您的胳膊早点儿好起来，洛奇夫人。”罗达低声说。

她跟洛奇夫人道了别，开始往家走。她为既可怜又无辜的年轻夫人感到难过，不想伤害她。但她一点儿也不为那位丈夫难过。她一边往家里走，一边想着这个男人。“好啊，洛奇场主，”罗达想，“你曾经爱过我，却离开了我，而且没给我一点儿帮助。你想娶一个更年轻、更漂亮的新妻子。可她现在也不那么漂亮了，不是吗？”

第二天，罗达干完晚上挤奶的活儿后，从奶牛场往家走。快要到家的时候，她看见格特鲁德·洛奇跟在她后面。罗达走下山来，迎上了她。

“啊，罗达！”格特鲁德叫着，“我要见你——我想问你……”她苍白的脸上满是焦虑，右手托着她的左胳膊。“有人告诉我，”她说，“在埃格登荒原有个人，大家不知道他的名字，但都说他是位有名的'大师'，说他能帮人们解决……这种事。”

她低头看了看自己的左胳膊，又看了看罗达，目光中透着期待。“他们说你知道这个人，这位大师。你知道他的名字吗？”

“他们说的可能是特伦德尔先生。”罗达缓缓地说。她感到有些不舒服。这位特伦德尔先生，人们说他可以做到很多稀奇的事情。他能解梦，能将幻影从房子中驱逐出去，还能破解巫术……“我不是 女巫！”她想，“我不是 ！我根本不信这些东西。”

格特鲁德望着她。“你认识他，”她说，“我从你的表情能看出来。其实，我也不相信什么'大师'。他们能做什么呢？可是……唉，我只能去找找他了。去他家的路远吗？”

“很远——大概五英里。”罗达说。

“唉，我只能走着过去。我不能跟我丈夫说这件事。罗达，你能跟我一起去，帮我带路吗？明天下午行不行？”

“哦，不……这……我……”罗达吞吞吐吐道。

“求你了！”格特鲁德说。

最终，罗达还是没能推辞。洛奇夫人为人善良，心肠又好，她需要朋友的帮助。可是，或许大师真的能够看透梦境。罗达不想去见这位特伦德尔先生，她害怕……

第二天下午，罗达和格特鲁德在房子边的树旁会合，然后开始了长途跋涉，穿过群山，往埃格登荒原走去。那天天很冷，山顶上方的天空阴沉沉的，透着不祥的感觉。

在村子外面，两人找到了特伦德尔先生的房子。她们到的时候，他正巧在家。这是一位头发花白的老人。见到罗达，他死死地盯着她看了好长时间。洛奇夫人跟他讲起自己胳膊的事，他便仔细查看起那只胳膊来。

“没错，大夫拿这个没辙。”他说，“这是你的敌人搞出来的。”

罗达往后缩了缩。

“敌人？什么敌人？”洛奇夫人问。

“我不知道，”大师看着她说，“但你自己可能知道。我可以让你看到那个人。你想让我这么做吗？”

“嗯，”格特鲁德说，“我想，请让我看到吧！”

特伦德尔先生将格特鲁德带到另一间屋子，不过没把门关上，罗达可以看到屋子里面的情形。

大师拿出一只鸡蛋，施了些法术。然后，他在桌子上放了杯水，小心地把鸡蛋磕破。蛋清流进水中，变成了奶白色，缓缓地打着转。

他把玻璃杯放到格特鲁德面前。“低头看水里面，”他说，“找一张脸。”

格特鲁德低头向水里凝视。

“你见到一张脸了吗？”大师轻声问。

格特鲁德低声回答了什么，但是罗达听不到。她从门旁边走开了。

洛奇夫人从里面出来时，面色苍白——比罗达的脸色还要差。特伦德尔先生在她身后关上了门。两个女人开始往回走，可两人之间的关系已经跟来时不一样了。

“他——他跟您要钱了吗？”罗达小声地问。

“哦，没，没要。他一分钱都不要。”格特鲁德说。

“那您看见了什么？”罗达问。

“没什么……我——我不想说这个。”

格特鲁德没有看罗达。她年轻漂亮的脸仿佛一下子老了十岁，现在看起来更像罗达梦中的那个幻影了。

她们沉默了许久。之后，格特鲁德突然说：“你是故意想 让我来这儿见这位大师的吗？你这么做太不可思议了！”

“不，我没想让您来。可是现在我也不后悔我们来了。”

自从上次的梦以后，罗达第一次感到有点儿高兴。她想，生活是残酷的，格特鲁德·洛奇必须学到这个教训。

在余下来长长的路程当中，两个人再没有提起造访大师的事。可是其他人却相反，所有农场和奶牛场的人们都在悄悄谈论着这件事。洛奇夫人已经不能用她萎缩的胳膊做任何事了，而罗达·布鲁克的名字前面也被人们加上了“女巫”两个字。

罗达没跟任何人提起过她梦中的幻影，可她的脸却愈发瘦削，愈发苍白。春天的时候，她和儿子搬离了原来的家，到西面的山里去了。

The cure for a curse

Six years went past, and Mr and Mrs Lodge's married life was not happy. The farmer said little, and did not often smile. His wife had a withered arm, and there were no children to call him 'father', and to run laughing around the farmhouse. He thought of Rhoda Brook and her son. His son. But that was the past, and he could not change it now.

Gertrude Lodge was a different woman too. She was only twenty-five, but she looked older. Once a happy, smiling woman, she was now sad and worried all the time. She loved her husband, but he no longer loved her, and she knew it.'Six years of married life, and only a few months of love,' she sometimes whispered.

Her left arm was no better. She tried one thing after another, but nothing helped it. Some of the things were a little strange, and her husband did not like them.

'You think too much about your arm,' he said. 'You need somebody to talk to – somebody to be around the house. At one time there was a boy... I wanted him to come and live with us, but he is too old now. And he went away. I don't know where.'

'You think too much about your arm,' Farmer Lodge said.

Gertrude knew about this boy now, and all of Rhoda Brook's story, but she and her husband never spoke about it. And she never said anything to him about her visit to the Wise Man of Egdon Heath, or about the face in the glass.

She wanted so much to find a cure for her arm. 'My husband cannot love me because of this arm,' she thought. 'So I must find a cure for it, I must. The Wise Man helped me before. Perhaps he can help me again.'

So one day she walked to Egdon Heath. She did not know the way, but at last she found the house.

'You can send away other things, I know,' she said to Trendle. 'Hair on women's faces, and things like that. Why can't you send this away?' She uncovered her poor, withered arm.

'No, I'm sorry, but I can't help you,' said Trendle. 'Your arm is withered because of a curse. It's not easy to find a cure for that.'

'Is there no cure, anywhere?' asked Gertrude sadly.

'Is there no cure, anywhere?' asked Gertrude sadly.

'There is one thing...' Trendle began slowly. 'But it's not easy for a woman to do.'

'Oh, tell me!' said Gertrude. 'Please!'

'You must put the withered arm on the neck of a hanged man. You must do it before he's cold – just after they take his body down.'

Gertrude's face was pale. 'How can that do good?'

'It can turn the blood, and that changes many things in the body. You must go to the jail when they hang someone, and wait for the body when they bring it in. In the old days lots of people did it; these days, not so many do it. But it is still the best cure for a curse.'

Back at home Gertrude thought about this for a long time. She tried to forget it, but she couldn't. She wanted to be pretty again, she wanted her husband to love her again. Yes, she must try this cure, she must.

'But how do I do it?' she thought. 'Where is the nearest jail? How can I get there? How often do they hang people? And when there is a hanging, how can I learn about it before it happens?'

So many questions. There was no one to help her, but slowly she began to find the answers. She asked careful questions in the village, because country people always know everything.

One old man was very helpful. 'The nearest jail is at Casterbridge, fifteen miles away,' he told Gertrude. 'They have trials there every three months, and there's usually a hanging after the trials. Some poor man or boy takes a cow or a sheep, or just some bread, and they hang him for it. Lots of people go to watch the hangings. I don't know why.'

'There's usually a hanging after the trials.'

The next trials were in July, Gertrude learnt. She asked her husband about them, but Lodge said very little. He was colder to her than usual, and she did not ask him again. He was often away these days, so she did not see much of him.

July came, and Gertrude went to see the helpful old man in the village again. 'Just one hanging this time,' he told her. 'It's for arson, I think. They're going to hang him next Saturday.'

Gertrude walked slowly home. 'I cannot tell my husband about this... this cure,' she thought. 'And how can I be away from home for two nights? What can I say to him?'

But in the end it was easy. On the Thursday before the hanging, Lodge came to her. 'I'm going away for three nights,' he said. 'It's about farm work, so you can't come with me.'

'That's all right,' Gertrude said quietly. 'I'm happy to stay at home.'

They said nothing more, and on Thursday Lodge drove away in the carriage.

解咒的灵方

六年过去了，洛奇先生和夫人的婚姻生活并不幸福。农场主几乎不怎么说话，也很少笑。他的妻子有一条胳膊萎缩了，他们也没有孩子，没有人在农舍里欢笑奔跑、叫他“爸爸”。他想到罗达·布鲁克和她的儿子。他的儿子。但一切都已成为过去，他现在无力改变了。

格特鲁德·洛奇也完全变了样。她才25岁，看起来却老得多。她曾经是个快乐、爱笑的女人，现在却变得整天郁郁寡欢，忧心忡忡。她爱她的丈夫，可丈夫却不再爱她，她清楚这一点。“六年的婚姻，只有几个月的爱。”她有时这样轻声自语。

她的左胳膊毫无起色。她试了一个又一个办法，却没有一个管用。有些办法有点儿怪异，她丈夫很不喜欢。

“你想你的胳膊想得太多了。”他说，“你需要跟人聊聊天——家里应该多个人。曾经有个男孩儿……我曾经想让他过来跟我们生活在一起，可现在他年纪已经太大了。他走了。我都不知道他在哪儿。”

格特鲁德此时已经知道这个男孩儿以及所有关于罗达的事，但她从来没跟丈夫提起过。她也从来没跟他说过去埃格登荒原拜访大师的事，更没说过在杯子中看到的面孔。

她非常想找到一个能治愈她胳膊的法子。“我丈夫是因为这只胳膊才不爱我的。”她想，“所以我必须找到治疗的方法，必须。大师曾经帮过我，或许他还能再帮我一次。”

于是有一天，她又步行去了埃格登荒原。她不认得路，但最终还是找到了那座房子。

“我知道您可以赶走很多东西，”她对特伦德尔说，“比如女人脸上的毛发什么的。为什么您不能把这个东西也赶走呢？”她露出她那可怜的、萎缩的胳膊。

“不能，对不起，我没办法帮你。”特伦德尔说，“你的胳膊是由于诅咒而萎缩的。要找到一个破解的方法很不容易。”

“真的没有办法？哪儿都没有？”格特鲁德伤心地问。

“办法倒是有一个……”特伦德尔欲言又止，“可是对于一个女人来说太难做到了。”

“啊，快告诉我！”格特鲁德说，“求您了！”

“你得把萎缩的胳膊放到一个被绞死的男人的脖子上。必须赶在他的尸体变冷之前——就在尸体刚被抬下来时。”

格特鲁德脸色煞白：“这样做能有什么用呢？”

“这样能流转血脉，也就能改变身体里的许多东西。你必须在监狱要执行绞刑的时候到那儿去，等着他们把尸体抬回来。过去好多人用过这个法子，现在没那么多人用了。但这仍然是解除诅咒的最好办法。”

回到家以后，格特鲁德为这件事想了很久。她想忘掉，可怎么都忘不掉。她想变回漂亮的样子，想让丈夫重新爱上自己。是的，她必须试试这个办法，必须。

“可是我该怎么做？”她想，“最近的监狱在哪里？我怎么才能到那儿？他们多长时间执行一次绞刑？他们执行绞刑的时候，我怎么才能提前知道？”

问题太多了。没有人帮她，不过慢慢地，她还是找到了答案。她小心地向村子里的人们询问，因为乡下人总是什么都知道。

一个老人帮了她很大的忙。“离这儿最近的监狱在卡斯特桥，有十五英里远。”他告诉格特鲁德，“每三个月那里会进行一次审判，每次审判之后一般会有一次绞刑。哪个穷人或穷孩子偷了一头牛或一只羊，甚至只是些面包，就会被绞死。很多人会去观看绞刑，我也不明白为什么。”

格特鲁德得知下一次审判是在七月份。她向自己的丈夫询问审判的事，但洛奇说得很少。他对她比以往更加冷漠，她也就不再问他了。最近这段时间他总是出去，所以她也很少见到他。

七月到了，格特鲁德又去村子里见那位帮她忙的老人。“这次只绞死一个人。”他告诉她，“好像是因为纵火。他们要在下周六把他绞死。”

格特鲁德慢慢地走回了家。“我不能告诉丈夫这件事……这个解咒的办法。”她想，“而且我怎么才能离开两个晚上呢？该怎么跟他说呢？”

可到了最后，问题反倒很容易便解决了。绞刑前的那个周四，洛奇来到她跟前。“我要出去三个晚上，”他说，“是农活儿的事，所以你不能跟我一起去。”

“好的。”格特鲁德轻声说，“我乐意待在家里。”

他们没再说别的。周四那天，洛奇驾着马车离开了。

The hangman

The next morning Gertrude got ready to leave for Caster bridge. She did not want to go by road because she did not want to meet any of her husband's friends. So she took one of the heavy horses from the farm, and rode west across the hills.

She was afraid of riding with a half-dead arm, but the farm horse was quiet and slow, and easy to ride. He carried her uphill and downhill, past rivers and through trees, moving west all the time.

The sun slowly went down in the sky, and it was nearly eight o'clock when Gertrude stopped for a moment at the top of a hill. It was the last hill before the town, and she could see the roofs of Casterbridge below. There was a big building on a hill at the end of the town, with a white roof. She knew this was the jail, and she could see a lot of workmen on the roof.

Gertrude could see the roofs of Casterbridge below.

'What are they doing?' she thought. 'They're building something up there on the roof... Oh!'

Suddenly, she understood, and quickly turned her eyes away. It was a warm summer evening, but she shivered with cold.

'Tomorrow they're going to hang a man on that roof,' she thought. 'And when he is dead...'

She shivered again, but then she remembered her husband's cold words and his unsmiling face, and she rode on down into the town.

She found a room to stay for the night, and then went out into the town.

'What do I do now?' she thought. 'How can I get into the jail tomorrow? Who must I talk to? The men at the jail, or the hangman?'

She was afraid to go to the jail, so she went to find the hangman. He had a house down by the river, a boy in the town told her.

When she found the house, she stood outside for some minutes, afraid to go to the door. Then the door opened and a man came out.

'Who are you?' he called out. 'What do you want?'

'Who are you?' the man called out. 'What do you want?'

'I want to speak to you for a minute.'

He came nearer, and looked at her. 'Well, well, that's a pretty face,' he said. 'Come into the house.'

They went inside. Davies (that was his name) was a hangman on some days, but a gardener on other days.

'Is it about gardening work?' he asked Gertrude. 'I can't do any tomorrow, because I'm working at the jail.'

'Yes, yes, I know. That's why I'm here.'

'Ah! I thought so. Is the poor man one of your family then? Perhaps your young brother? No,' – Davies looked at Gertrude's dress – 'I don't think so. Was he one of your farm workers perhaps?'

'No. What time is the hanging?'

'The same as usual – twelve o'clock.'

'And it is... it is going to happen, yes?'

'Oh yes, nothing can stop the hanging now,' said Davies.'But I'm sorry for this young man, I truly am. He's only eighteen. They say it was arson, but I don't know. He was there when the fire began, but there were twenty other men there too. So how do they know? I think they just want to hang someone... anyone. But what can I do for you, my pretty?'

'I need a cure,' Gertrude said, 'a cure for a curse. And a Wise Man told me about the hanged man, and – and turning the blood...'

'Oh yes, miss! Now I understand. People sometimes come for that. But not pretty young things like you. Well, well. What's the cure for?'

'It's this.' Gertrude uncovered her left arm.

'Ah! It's all withered,' said the hangman, looking at it.

'Yes,' she said.

'Well, a hanged man's neck is the best cure for that,' he said. 'Your Wise Man was right.'

'So can you help me?' Gertrude whispered.

'Usually people go to the jail, and take their doctor with them, and give their name and address... But yes, I can help you – for a little money, perhaps.'

'Oh, thank you!' Gertrude said. 'It's better like this. I don't want people to know about it.'

'Don't want your lover to know, eh?'

'No – husband.'

'Aha! Very well. You can touch the body.'

'Where is it now?' she said, shivering.

'It? – He , you mean; he's still alive tonight. He's in the jail, a little room right at the top.'

'And what must I do tomorrow?' Gertrude said.

'There's a little door at the back of the jail. Be there at one o'clock, no later. I can open the door from inside, and can take you to the body when they bring him in. Goodnight. Don't be late. And you don't want people to see you, so cover your face. Goodnight, my pretty!'

'There's a little door at the back of the jail.'

Gertrude went away, and walked up to the jail on the hill. She wanted to find the little door at the back, to know it for tomorrow. Then she went back down into the town and went to her room, and waited for the morning.

刽子手

第二天一早，格特鲁德准备出发前往卡斯特桥。她不想走大路，因为不想碰到任何她丈夫的朋友。于是她牵了农场上一匹健壮的马，翻山越岭朝西而去。

拖着一条几乎残废的胳膊骑马赶路，她有点儿担心，好在这匹马温顺，走得也慢，不难驾驭。马儿驮着她跋山涉水，穿过树林，一直朝西走。

太阳慢慢地从天空落了下去，快到八点的时候，格特鲁德在一座山的山顶稍作停歇。这是到达镇子前的最后一个山头，她能看到山下卡斯特桥镇上房子的屋顶了。在镇子尽头的山上，有一座很大的建筑，屋顶是白色的。她知道这就是监狱。她还看到屋顶上有好多工人。

“他们在做什么？”她想，“在屋顶上把什么东西竖起来……啊！”

她突然明白过来，于是立刻把目光转向了别处。这是个温暖的夏夜，她却冷得发抖。

“明天他们就要在屋顶上绞死一个人。”她想，“他死了以后……”

她又打了个寒战。但转念想起丈夫冷漠的话语和没有笑容的面孔，她又继续骑着马朝镇上走去。

她先是找了间过夜的屋子，然后出门去了镇上。

“我现在该做什么？”她想，“我明天怎么才能进到监狱里面？我要去找谁说？是监狱里的人，还是执行绞刑的刽子手？”

她不敢去监狱，只好去找刽子手。镇子里的一个男孩告诉她，刽子手在河的下游有座房子。

找到房子之后，她在外面站了几分钟，不敢去敲门。这时，门开了，一个男人走了出来。

“你是谁？”他喊道，“你想干什么？”

“我想跟您谈几句话。”

男人来到她跟前，看着她。“唔，不错，好漂亮的脸蛋儿。”他说，“进来吧！”

他们进到屋内。戴维斯（这是男人的名字）有些日子做刽子手，其他时候则是个园丁。

“是园艺活儿吗？”他问格特鲁德，“我明天做不了，因为得给监狱干活儿。”

“是，是，我知道。这正是我来这儿的原因。”

“啊！我猜就是这样。那个可怜的家伙是你的家人？大概是你弟弟吧？不对，”戴维斯看着格特鲁德的裙子——“应该不是你弟弟。他是你农场上的工人吧？”

“不是。绞刑什么时候执行？”

“跟平常一样——十二点钟。”

“那……那是 会执行了，对吗？”

“哦，是的。现在没有什么能阻止这次行刑了。”戴维斯说，“不过我倒是替那个年轻人难过，真心难过。他才十八岁。他们说他是纵火犯，我看倒是不见得。火着起来的时候他是在那儿，可还有另外二十个人也在那儿啊。他们怎么知道是谁放的火呢？我猜他们就是为了要绞死个人……管他是谁。对了，我能为你做点儿什么呢，美人儿？”

“我需要一个秘方，”格特鲁德说，“一个解除咒语的秘方。一位大师告诉我要找个刚绞死的人，这样——这样就能流转血脉……”

“哦，对啊，小姐！现在我明白了。有时是有些人会为这事而来。不过还没有像你这么漂亮的。好吧，好吧。这个秘方是要治什么？”

“治这个。”格特鲁德露出左胳膊。

“啊！萎缩成这样了。”刽子手看着胳膊说。

“是啊。”她说。

“没错，绞刑犯的脖子是治这个的最好办法。”他说，“你的大师说得对。”

“那您能帮我吗？”格特鲁德小声问。

“病人通常要到监狱去，还要带着他们的大夫，报上名字和地址……不过没关系，我能帮你——只要你给点儿钱。”

“哦，谢谢您！”格特鲁德说，“这样更好。我不想让别人知道这件事。”

“不想让你的情人知道，是吗？”

“不——是丈夫。”

“啊哈！好吧。可以让你摸那具尸体。”

“它现在在哪儿？”她颤抖着问。

“它？——你说的是他 吧。他今儿晚上还活着，就在监狱顶层的一个小监房里面。”

“我明天要怎么做？”格特鲁德问。

“监狱后面有扇小门。一点钟的时候等在那里，别来晚了。我从里面把门打开，等他们把尸体抬回来，我就把你带过去。晚安。别来晚了。不想让别人看见你，就把脸遮上吧。晚安，我的美人儿！”

格特鲁德离开之后，走到小山上的监狱跟前。她想找到监狱后面那扇小门，好知道明天怎么走。随后，她下山回到了镇子里自己的房间，等待着早晨的到来。

The blood turns

At half past twelve on Saturday Gertrude Lodge walked up the hill to the jail. She went there by the small back streets, because there were so many people in the town. They were there for a holiday, to watch the hanging.

At one o'clock she was inside the jail. The hangman took her to a long dark room with a table. 'Wait there,' he told her.'Two or three minutes, no more.'

He went away, and Gertrude waited. She had a veil over her face, and her left arm was uncovered, ready. She stood still, with her eyes closed, listening, and shivering with terror.

Soon she heard noises, and could hear heavy feet on the stairs. The heavy feet came nearer, and four men came into the room with a long box. It was open, and in it was the body of a young man, with a cover over his face. The men put the box down on the table.

Four men came into the room with a long box.

'Now!' said a voice in Gertrude's ear. 'Now!'

But the young woman was half-dead with terror, and at first she could not move. Then she opened her eyes and came up to the table. She could hear other noises outside the room. There were more people coming.

Davies the hangman was by her side. He uncovered the body's face, took Gertrude's hand, and put her arm across the dead man's neck.

Gertrude screamed.

And at once there was a second scream. A woman's scream, but not Gertrude's. Gertrude turned round.

Behind her stood Rhoda Brook, her face pale, and her eyes red with crying. Behind Rhoda stood Gertrude's husband. He looked old and sad, but there were no tears in his eyes.

'You! What in God's name are you doing here?' he whispered angrily.

'Oh, cruel, cruel woman!' cried Rhoda. 'Why do you come between us and our child now? This is the true meaning of my dream! You are like that cruel phantom at last!'

When Gertrude saw her husband with Rhoda, she knew at once that the dead young man was Rhoda's son. She stared at Rhoda, with terror in her eyes.

Then Rhoda ran to Gertrude, closed her hand round the younger woman's arm, and pulled her away from the table. When she let go of the arm, the young wife fell down, at her husband's feet.

Rhoda ran to Gertrude, and pulled her away from the table.

She never opened her eyes again. They carried her out of the jail into the town, but she never got home alive. Perhaps it was the 'turning of the blood', perhaps it was her withered arm, perhaps it was her terror in the jail when she turned and saw Rhoda behind her. Doctors came and looked at her, but they could do nothing to help her, and three days later she died.

In those days the unhappy parents of a hanged man came and took the body away after the hanging. That was why Farmer Lodge was at the jail with Rhoda that day. It was not his first visit to the jail. With Rhoda, he went many times to visit his son that summer, and that was why he was away from the farm so often.

But after his young wife died, nobody ever saw Farmer Lodge in Casterbridge again. He went home to his farm, but he did not stay there long. After a short time he sold the farm and the farmhouse, and all the cows and sheep and horses. Then he went away to live in a small town by the sea. He lived very quietly, without any friends or family near him.

When he died two years later, he left a lot of money. Most of it went to a home for poor boys, but there was money for Rhoda Brook too.

For some time nobody could find Rhoda. Then one day she came back to her old house near the dairy. But she never took a penny of Farmer Lodge's money. She went back to work in the dairy, and worked there for many long years, milking the cows in the morning, and again in the evening. Her dark hair turned white, and her sad pale face looked thin and old.

Most people knew Rhoda's story, and sometimes they watched her at milking time. What did she think about, all those long days, at morning and evening milking?

But nobody ever asked her, and nobody ever knew the answer.

血脉流转

周六十二点半，格特鲁德·洛奇走上山，来到了监狱。因为镇子上人太多，她是沿着隐蔽的小街来到这里的。人们都像过节似的赶来看绞刑。

一点钟的时候，她进到了监狱里面。刽子手把她带到一个黑洞洞的狭长房间，房间里有一张桌子。“在这儿等着，”他告诉她，“两三分钟，不会很久。”

刽子手走开了，格特鲁德等在那里。她的脸上遮着面纱，左胳膊露在外面，已经准备好。她一动不动地站着，双眼紧闭，侧耳倾听，怕得直发抖。

很快，她听到了嘈杂的声音，还有沉重的上楼梯声。沉重的脚步声越来越近，四个人抬着一只长条箱子走进了房间。箱子敞开着，里面是一个年轻人的尸体，脸上盖着块布。那几个人把箱子放在桌子上。

“快！”格特鲁德耳边传来一个声音，“快！”

可是这年轻的妇人已经吓得半死，一时间连动都不能动。过了一会儿，她才睁开眼睛来到桌子前。她听到房间外面还有声音，更多的人过来了。

刽子手戴维斯站在她旁边。他揭开了尸体脸上的布，抓着格特鲁德的手，把她的胳膊搭在那个死人的脖子上。

格特鲁德尖叫起来。

几乎在同时，又一声尖叫传来。也是一个女人的尖叫，但不是格特鲁德的声音。格特鲁德转过身来。

在她身后站着罗达·布鲁克，脸色惨白，眼睛哭得通红。罗达身后站着格特鲁德的丈夫。他看起来苍老而又悲伤，可是眼睛里却没有泪水。

“是你！你 究竟来这儿干吗？”他愤怒地低声问道。

“啊，残忍啊，残忍的女人！”罗达哭喊着，“为什么现在来挡在我们和孩子之间？这才是我那个梦的真正含义！你到底变成了那个残忍的幻影！”

格特鲁德一看到她丈夫跟罗达在一起，立刻就明白了那个死去的年轻人是罗达的儿子。她注视着罗达，眼睛里充满了恐惧。

这时，罗达跑向格特鲁德，用手抓住年轻女人的胳膊，把她从桌子旁拉开。等到罗达把手松开，年轻夫人摔倒在丈夫的脚下。

她再也没有睁开眼睛。人们把她从监狱里抬到了镇上，而她却没能活着回家。或许是因为“血脉流转”，或许是因为萎缩的胳膊，又或许是因为在监狱中转身见到罗达时受到的惊吓。大夫来看过她，却无力回天，三天之后，她死了。

在那个年代，不幸的父母会到监狱来把被绞死的孩子的尸体带走。正因为如此，洛奇农场主和罗达那天才会出现在监狱中。这并不是洛奇农场主第一次去监狱。那年夏天，他和罗达到监狱去了很多次，去探望他们的儿子，这也正是他经常离开农场的原因。

然而，自从洛奇农场主年轻的妻子死后，再没有人在卡斯特桥见到过他。他回了农场，但没待多长时间。没过多久，他就卖掉了农场、农舍，以及所有的牛、羊和马。后来，他搬到海边的一个小镇居住。他悄无声息地活着，身边没有朋友，也没有家人。

两年之后他死了，留下了一大笔钱。大部分钱给了一家穷苦孩子的收容所，也有一点儿钱留给了罗达·布鲁克。

有一段时间，没人能找到罗达。后来有一天，她回到了奶牛场附近的老房子。可她没拿洛奇农场主的一分钱。她回到奶牛场工作，并且在那里干了很多年，每天早上挤一次牛奶，晚上再挤一次。她的黑发变成了白发，苍白忧伤的脸看起来瘦削而苍老。

大多数人都知道罗达的故事，有时还会在她挤牛奶的时候望望她。在那些漫长的日子里，每天早晚挤牛奶的时候，她在想些什么呢？

没有人问过她，也没有人知道答案。

A LITTLE PRINCESS

Ralph Crewe lives in India, with his little daughter Sara. He is a rich man, and when he brings Sara to Miss Minchin's school in London, Miss Minchin is very pleased. She likes girls with rich fathers, because it is good for her school. Mr Crewe loves Sara very much, and he buys her lots of beautiful dresses, and books, and dolls. Miss Minchin smiles, but she says to her sister: 'Sara looks like a little princess, not a schoolgirl!'

Mr Crewe goes back to his work in India, and Sara begins her new life at school. She is a kind, friendly girl. Everybody likes her, and she soon makes friends.

But when you are rich, everybody is your friend. On Sara's eleventh birthday, there is some terrible news from India. Poor Sara is very unhappy, and she quickly learns who her true friends are...

1

School in England

One cold winter day a little girl and her father arrived in London. Sara Crewe was seven years old, and she had long black hair and green eyes. She sat in the cab next to her father and looked out of the window at the tall houses and the dark sky.

'What are you thinking about, Sara?' Mr Crewe asked. 'You are very quiet.' He put his arm round his daughter.

'I'm thinking about our house in India,' said Sara. 'And the hot sun and the blue sky. I don't think I like England very much, Father.'

'Yes, it's very different from India,' her father said. 'But you must go to school in London, and I must go back to India and work.'

'Yes, Father, I know,' said Sara. 'But I want to be with you. Please come to school with me! I can help you with your lessons.'

Mr Crewe smiled, but he was not happy. He loved his little Sara very much, and he did not want to be without her. Sara's mother was dead, and Sara was his only child. Father and daughter were very good friends.

Soon they arrived at Miss Minchin's School for Girls and went into the big house.

Miss Minchin was a tall woman in a black dress. She looked at Sara, and then gave a very big smile.

'What a beautiful child!' she said to Mr Crewe.

Sara stood quietly and watched Miss Minchin. 'Why does she say that?' she thought. 'I am not beautiful, so why does she say it?'

Sara was not beautiful, but her father was rich. And Miss Minchin liked girls with rich fathers, because it was good for the school (and good for Miss Minchin, too).

'Sara is a good girl,' Mr Crewe said to Miss Minchin. 'Her mother was French, so she speaks French well. She loves books, and she reads all the time. But she must play with the other girls and make new friends, too.'

'Of course,' said Miss Minchin. She smiled again. 'Sara is going to be very happy here, Mr Crewe.'

Mr Crewe stayed in London for a week. He and Sara went to the shops, and he bought many beautiful, expensive dresses for his daughter. He bought books, and flowers for her room, and a big doll with beautiful dresses, too.

Miss Minchin smiled, but she said to her sister Amelia: 'All that money on dresses for a child of seven! She looks like a little princess, not a schoolgirl!'

*　　*　　*

When Mr Crewe left London, he was very sad. Sara was very sad too, but she did not cry. She sat in her room and thought about her father on the ship back to India.

'Father wants me to be happy,' she said to her new doll. 'I love him very much and I want to be a good daughter, so I must be happy.'

It was a very big, and very beautiful doll, but of course it could not answer.

Sara soon made new friends in the school. Some little rich girls are not very nice children—they think they are important because they have money and lots of expensive things. But Sara was different. She liked beautiful dresses and dolls, but she was more interested in people, and books, and telling stories.

She was very good at telling stories. She was a clever child, and the other girls loved to listen to her. The stories were all about kings and queens and princesses and wonderful countries across the sea.

'How do you think of all those things?' asked her best friend, Ermengarde.

'I have all these pictures in my head,' said Sara. 'So it's easy to tell stories about them.'

Poor Ermengarde was not clever. She could never remember any of her school lessons, and Miss Minchin was always angry with her.

Sara often helped Ermengarde with her lessons. 'Listen, Ermie,' she said. 'You remember that French king, Louis the Sixteenth? Well, this is a story about him. One day in 1792...'

And so Ermengarde learnt her lessons through Sara's stories, and she loved her friend very much. But not everybody was Sara's friend. Lavinia was an older girl. Before Sara came, Lavinia was the richest and the most important girl in the school. But Sara's father was richer than Lavinia's father. So now Sara was more important than Lavinia, and Lavinia did not like that.

'Oh, Sara is so clever!' Lavinia often said. 'Sara is so good at French! Her dresses are so beautiful, and she can sing so well! And she is so rich! Of course Miss Minchin likes her best!'

Sara did not answer when Lavinia said these things. Sometimes, it was not easy, but Sara was a kind, friendly girl, and she did not like to be angry with anyone.

1 ．英国的学校

那是一个寒冷的冬天。一个小女孩儿跟她的父亲来到了伦敦。小女孩儿名叫萨拉·克鲁，7岁了，有着长长的黑发，眼睛碧蓝明亮。她坐在出租车里父亲的身边，眼睛望着窗外高大的房屋和昏暗的天空。

“你在想什么呢，萨拉？”克鲁先生问她，“怎么不说话？”他搂着自己的女儿说。

“我想我们在印度的房子，”萨拉说，“还有火热的太阳和蓝蓝的天空。我觉得我不怎么喜欢英国，爸爸。”

“是的，这里跟印度很不一样，”父亲说道，“可你得在伦敦上学，我得回印度工作。”

“是的，爸爸，我知道，”萨拉回答，“可我想跟你在一起。跟我一起来上学吧！我会帮你学习功课的。”

克鲁先生笑了，可他并不高兴。他非常爱他的小萨拉，也不想离开她。萨拉的母亲去世了，萨拉是他唯一的孩子。父亲和女儿是很好的朋友。

他们很快来到了明钦小姐的女子学校，走进了那座高大的建筑。

明钦小姐个头很高，一身黑色的衣着。她望着萨拉，笑容可掬。

“这孩子长得真漂亮！”她对克鲁先生说。

萨拉静静地站着，看着明钦小姐。“她为什么这么说呢？”她想，“我不漂亮呀，可她为什么那样夸我？”

萨拉确实不漂亮，可她父亲很有钱。明钦小姐就喜欢父亲有钱的女孩儿，因为这样对学校有好处（当然对明钦小姐也有好处）。

“萨拉是个好姑娘，”克鲁先生对明钦小姐说道，“她妈妈是法国人，所以她法语说得很好。她喜欢书，经常读书。可她也得跟其他姑娘一起玩，也得交些新朋友。”

“当然是了，”明钦小姐说着又笑了，“克鲁先生，萨拉在这里会很快乐的。”

克鲁先生在伦敦待了一周时间。他和萨拉一同逛了许多商店，给女儿买了许多漂亮、昂贵的衣服，还给她的屋里买了书和花儿，还有一个穿着漂亮衣服的洋娃娃。

明钦小姐面带笑容，可她对她姐姐阿米莉亚说：“给一个7岁的女孩儿花那么多钱买衣服！她看起来就像个小公主一样，不像学生！”

*　　*　　*

克鲁先生离开伦敦时心里非常难受。萨拉也很难过，可她并没有哭出来。她坐在自己的房间里，心里惦记着乘船返回印度的父亲。

“爸爸要我生活得快乐，”她对她的新洋娃娃说，“我这么爱他，我要做他的乖女儿，所以我必须高兴起来。”

那个洋娃娃很大，也很漂亮，可它当然不会回答她。

萨拉在学校里很快就交上了新朋友。一些家里有钱的小姑娘并不是好孩子——她们因为家里有钱，自己拥有很多贵重的东西而觉得自己很了不起。可萨拉不是这样。她也喜欢漂亮的衣服和洋娃娃，可更喜欢跟人们交往，喜欢读书，喜欢讲故事。

她很会讲故事。她脑瓜儿很聪明，别的女孩儿都爱听她讲故事。她讲的故事都是关于国王、王后、公主，还有大海另一边的美丽国家的。

“你怎么能记得住那么多事情呢？”她最好的朋友埃芒加德问她。

“所有这些东西的样子就装在我的脑袋里，”萨拉回答，“所以讲关于它们的故事就很容易。”

可怜的埃芒加德没那么聪明。她老是记不住老师课上讲的东西，所以明钦小姐总是生她的气。

萨拉经常在学习上帮助埃芒加德。“听着，埃米，”她说，“记得法国国王路易十六吧？好，下面我讲一个关于他的故事。1792年的一天……”

于是埃芒加德就通过萨拉的故事学习了功课，她非常爱她这个朋友。但并不是每个人都是萨拉的朋友。拉维尼娅是个年龄大一些的女孩儿，萨拉来之前，她是学校里最有钱最受宠的女孩儿。可萨拉的父亲比拉维尼娅的父亲更有钱，于是现在萨拉比拉维尼娅更受宠，拉维尼娅对此耿耿于怀。

“哦，萨拉这么 聪明！”拉维尼娅经常这样说，“萨拉法语学得这么 好！她的衣服都这么 漂亮，歌又唱得这么 好！她这么 有钱！明钦老师当然最喜欢她！”

拉维尼娅这么说的时候，萨拉默不作声。有时候能做到这样并不容易，可萨拉为人和善、友好，她不想跟任何人闹别扭。

The diamond mines

And so three years went by. Sara's father wrote to her often, and Sara wrote loving little letters back to him. One day a very exciting letter arrived. Everybody in the school talked about it for days.

'My friend,' wrote Mr Crewe, 'has some mines in northern India, and a month ago his workers found diamonds there. There are thousands of diamonds in these mines, but it is expensive work to get them out. My friend needs my help. So, Little Missus' ( this was Mr Crewe's special name for Sara), 'I am putting all my money into my friend's diamond mines, and one day you and I are going to be very rich...'

Sara was not interested in money, but a story about diamond mines in India was exciting. Nearly everybody was very pleased for Sara, but not Lavinia, of course.

'Huh!' she said. 'My mother has a diamond. Lots of people have diamonds. What's so interesting about diamond mines?'

'But there are thousands of diamonds in these mines,' said Ermengarde. 'Perhaps millions of them!'

Lavinia laughed. 'Is Sara going to wear diamonds in her hair at breakfast, then? Or is it "Princess Sara" now?'

Sara's face went red. She looked at Lavinia angrily, but said quietly, 'Some people call me "princess". I know that. But princesses don't get angry or say unkind things, so I'm not going to say anything to you, Lavinia.'

'To me, you are a princess,' Ermengarde said to Sara later. 'And you always look like a princess, in your beautiful dresses.'

*　　*　　*

Sara was a princess to another girl, too. This was Becky. She was a servant in Miss Minchin's school, and she was only fourteen years old, but she worked all day and sometimes half the night. She carried things upstairs and downstairs, she cleaned the floors, she made the fires, and she was always tired and hungry and dirty. She and Sara had very different lives.

But one day Sara came into her bedroom, and there was Becky, sleeping in a chair.

'Oh, you poor thing!' Sara said.

Then Becky opened her eyes and saw Sara. She got up at once. 'Oh, Miss!' she said. 'I'm very sorry, Miss! I just sat down for a minute and—'

'Don't be afraid,' said Sara. She gave Becky a friendly smile. 'You were tired. That's all.'

'Are you—are you going to tell Miss Minchin?' asked Becky. She began to move to the door.

'Of course not,' said Sara. 'Please don't run away. Sit down again for a minute. You look so tired.'

'Oh, Miss, I can't!' Becky said. 'You're very kind, Miss, but Miss Minchin—'

'Please,' said Sara. She took Becky's hand. 'You're only a little girl, like me. Let's be friends.'

And so Becky sat down again, and soon she and Sara were friends. Nobody knew about this, of course. Rich little girls at Miss Minchin's school did not make friends with servant-girls, and it was a wonderful thing for Becky. Nearly every day she and Sara met in Sara's bedroom, just for five or ten minutes. Becky was always hungry, and Sara often bought nice things for her to eat. They sat and talked, and sometimes Sara told Becky some of her stories. Becky loved that.

'Oh, Miss,' she said. 'You tell them so beautifully! Sometimes I like your stories better than things to eat.'

And after those visits to Sara's room, Becky always felt better—not so tired, and not so hungry.

*　　*　　*

Some months later Sara had her eleventh birthday. Lessons stopped for the afternoon and there was a big party for all the girls in the school.

'This party is expensive for us,' Miss Minchin said to her sister Amelia. 'But it looks good for the school.'

That afternoon there was a visitor to the school—Miss Minchin's lawyer. He went with Miss Minchin into her office and they closed the door. In the schoolroom next door there was a lot of noise from Sara's party. Everybody in there was very happy.

But in the office Miss Minchin was not happy. She looked at the lawyer angrily. 'What are you saying? Mr Crewe has no money? What about the diamond mines?'

'There are no diamond mines,' said the lawyer. 'Well, there are mines, but there are no diamonds in them.'

'But Mr Crewe's good friend—' began Miss Minchin.

'Mr Crewe's good friend,' said the lawyer, 'ran away with all Mr Crewe's money. Ralph Crewe was ill with a fever, and when he heard about this, he got worse. A week later he was dead.'

'Dead!' cried Miss Minchin. 'But what about his daughter Sara? And this expensive birthday party?'

'Sara Crewe has no money,' said the lawyer. 'Not a penny in the world, Miss Minchin. Not a penny.'

'She must leave my school at once,' Miss Minchin said angrily. 'She must go this afternoon!'

'Where?' said the lawyer. 'Out into the streets? An eleven-year-old girl? That's not going to look very good for your school, Miss Minchin.'

Miss Minchin's face went red.

'You can't put her out in the streets,' said the lawyer. He stood up. 'But perhaps she can work for you.'

The lawyer left, and Miss Minchin called her sister Amelia. 'Bring Sara Crewe here at once,' she said.

Two minutes later Sara, in her beautiful blue party dress, stood in front of Miss Minchin.

'Have you a black dress, Sara?' Miss Minchin said coldly.

'Yes, Miss Minchin,' said Sara. 'But it's very small.'

'Go and put it on at once,' said Miss Minchin. 'Your father is dead. There were no diamond mines, and your father's friend ran away with all his money. You have nothing. Not a penny. But I am going to be very kind to you. You can stay in my house, but now you must be a servant and work for your bread. You can sleep in a servant's room upstairs, next to Becky's room.'

2 ．钻石矿

很快，三年过去了。其间萨拉的爸爸经常给她写信，萨拉也写些短信给爸爸回过去，表达自己的爱。一天她收到了一封让人非常兴奋的信。有好些日子，学校里的人都在谈论这封信的事情。

“我的一位朋友，” 克鲁先生在信中写道，“在印度北部拥有几座矿山，一个月前工人们在那里发现了钻石。矿区里有许多许多钻石，不过开采它们会是一项高投入的工作。我的朋友需要我的帮助，所以小米萨斯”（这是克鲁先生对萨拉特殊的昵称），“我把我所有的钱都投到了我朋友的钻石矿上，有一天我们会变得非常有钱……”

萨拉对钱并不感兴趣，可在印度发现钻石矿的故事却挺让人振奋的。几乎所有的人都为萨拉感到高兴，当然除了拉维尼娅。

“哼！”她开腔了，“我妈妈就有一颗钻石。很多人都有钻石。发现一个钻石矿有什么了不起的？”

“可是那些钻石矿里有成千上万颗钻石，”埃芒加德说道，“说不定有数百万颗呢！”

拉维尼娅笑了：“难道萨拉吃早饭时头上也要戴着钻石吗？或者说现在真要叫她‘萨拉公主’吗？”

萨拉听到后脸红了。她生气地看着拉维尼娅，但仍平静地说：“有人叫我‘公主’，这我知道，不过公主是不会随便生气，也不会说让人不愉快的话的，所以我什么也不想跟你说，拉维尼娅。”

“对我来说你就是 一位公主，”后来埃芒加德对萨拉说，“你穿着美丽的衣服，看起来一直就像一位公主。”

*　　*　　*

在另外一个女孩儿眼里，萨拉也是一个公主。她叫贝基，是明钦小姐学校里的一个仆人，只有14岁，可她整天都在忙着干活，有时还要忙到半夜。她把东西搬上搬下，又拖地板又生火，老是又累又饿，还脏兮兮的。她与萨拉过着完全不同的生活。

可是有一天萨拉回到房间里的时候，贝基正躺在一张椅子上睡觉。

“哦，真可怜啊！”萨拉说道。

贝基睁开眼睛看到了萨拉。她马上站了起来。“哦，小姐！”她说道，“非常抱歉，小姐！我刚刚坐下，还——”

“别害怕，”萨拉说着，冲贝基友好地笑了笑，“你太累了嘛，就是因为这个。”

“你——你是不是要告诉明钦小姐？”贝基边问边开始向门口挪动。

“当然不会，”萨拉说道，“不要跑开，再坐一会儿，你看起来很疲倦。”

“哦，小姐，不行！”贝基说，“你真好，小姐，可是明钦小姐她——”

“别这样，”萨拉说着握住贝基的手，“你还只是个小姑娘呀，跟我一样。让我们做朋友吧。”

于是贝基又坐了下来，两个人很快就成了朋友。当然没有人知道这件事情。在明钦小姐的学校里，有钱人家的女孩子是不会跟女仆交朋友的，所以这对于贝基来说真是一件了不起的事情。几乎每天她都要在萨拉的房间里与萨拉见面，虽然只有5到10分钟的时间。贝基老是感到饥饿，萨拉就经常买些好吃的给她吃。她们坐在那里聊天，有时萨拉给贝基讲些故事。贝基非常喜欢听。

“哦，小姐，”她说道，“这些故事你讲得真好！有时候比起那些吃的来，我更喜欢你讲的故事。”

每次从萨拉屋里出来后，贝基总是会感觉好多了——不再那么累，也不再那么饿了。

*　　*　　*

几个月后，萨拉要过她11岁的生日了。那天下午学校停了课，给所有的孩子们举办了一个非常盛大的宴会。

“宴会对我们来说挺奢侈的，”明钦小姐跟她姐姐阿米莉亚说道，“不过可以让学校看起来有光彩。”

那天下午学校里来了一位客人——他是明钦小姐的律师。他跟着明钦小姐走进她的办公室，然后关上了房门。隔壁教室里因为有萨拉的生日宴会而传来很大的喧闹声。宴会上的每个人都很高兴。

可办公室里的明钦小姐却高兴不起来。她生气地看着她的律师。“你说什么？克鲁先生没钱了？那钻石矿呢？”

“根本没有 什么钻石矿，”律师说，“不错，那里的确有矿藏，可里面根本没有钻石。”

“可克鲁先生的好朋友——”明钦小姐开口了。

“克鲁先生的好朋友，”律师说，“带着克鲁先生所有的钱跑了。拉尔夫·克鲁发烧生了病，当他听到这个消息后病情更加严重，一周后就撒手西去了。”

“死了！”明钦小姐叫了起来，“那他女儿萨拉怎么办？还有这昂贵的生日宴会怎么办？”

“萨拉·克鲁没有钱，”律师说道，“她在这个世界上一分钱都没有，明钦小姐，一分都没有。”

“那她得马上离开我的学校，”明钦小姐生气地说，“她今天下午就得走！”

“去哪儿？”律师问道，“到大街上流浪？你让一个11岁的女孩儿到大街上去流浪？那样看起来对你的学校可不太好，明钦小姐。”

明钦小姐的脸有些发红。

“你不能把她丢到街上不管，”律师说着站起身来，“不过她也许能为你做些活。”

律师走了，明钦小姐把她姐姐阿米莉亚叫了过来。“马上把萨拉·克鲁带来。”她说道。

两分钟后，萨拉穿着漂亮的蓝色礼服来到了明钦小姐面前。

“有黑衣服吗，萨拉？”明钦小姐冷冷地问。

“有呀，明钦老师，”萨拉答道，“可是很小。”

“马上去把它穿上，”明钦小姐说道，“你爸爸死了。根本没有什么钻石矿，你爸爸的朋友带着他所有的钱跑了。你什么也没有了，一分钱都没有了。可我还是不想亏待你。你可以住在我这里，但现在你是一个仆人了，你得干活养活自己。你可以住楼上仆人们的房间，就在贝基房间的隔壁。”

The new servant-girl

That evening, in the little attic room, Sara sat on the bed in her old black dress. She did not cry, but her face was white and she did not move or speak for hours.

Late at night the door opened quietly, and Becky looked in. Her eyes were red from crying. 'Oh, Miss,' she said. 'All the servants are talking about it. I'm so sorry—so sorry!' She looked at Sara's white face, and began to cry again. Then she ran to Sara, and took her hand.

At last Sara moved. Slowly, she turned her head and looked at Becky. 'Oh, Becky,' she said. And that was all.

That first night in the attic was very long. Sara did not sleep. 'Father is dead,' she whispered, again and again. 'Father is dead. I'm never going to see him again.'

The next morning Sara's new life began. She learnt to clean floors and to make fires. She ran upstairs and downstairs, and she worked in the kitchen.

The cook was a big woman with a red, angry face. 'So,' she said, 'the little rich girl with the diamond mines is now a servant, eh?' She looked at Sara. 'Now, I'm making apple pies this morning. Run down to the shops and get me some apples. And be quick!'

So Sara ran to the shops, and carried a big bag of apples back to the house. Then she cleaned the kitchen floor, and carried hot water up to all the bedrooms.

She worked every day, from early in the morning to late at night. She helped in the school, too.

'You speak French well,' Miss Minchin said to her coldly. 'So you can teach French to the younger children. But you're only a servant. Don't forget that.'

The first months of Sara's new life were very hard. She was always tired and hungry, but she never cried. At night, in her little attic, she thought about her father, dead in India all those miles away.

'I must be brave,' she said. 'Father always wanted me to be brave. And I have a bed to sleep in, and something to eat every day. Lots of people don't have that.'

At first Sara's only friend was Becky. Every day Becky came into Sara's room. They did not talk much, but it helped Sara a lot to see Becky's friendly, smiling face.

The girls in the school were sorry for Sara, but Sara was a servant now, and they could not be friendly with a servant. Lavinia, of course, was pleased. 'I never liked Sara Crewe,' she told her friends. 'And I was right about the diamonds—there weren't any!'

Ermengarde was very unhappy. When she saw Sara in the school, Sara walked past her and did not speak. Poor Ermengarde loved Sara and wanted to be friendly, but she was not clever, and she did not understand.

One morning, very early, she got quietly out of bed, went upstairs to the attics, and opened Sara's door.

'Ermengarde!' Sara said. 'What are you doing here?'

Ermengarde began to cry. 'Oh, Sara, please tell me. What is the matter? Why don't you like me now?'

'I do like you,' Sara said. 'Of course I do. But, you see, everything is different now. Miss Minchin doesn't want me to talk to the girls. Most of them don't want to talk to me. And I thought, perhaps, you didn't want to...'

'But I'm your friend !' cried Ermengarde. 'I'm always going to be your friend—and nobody can stop me!'

Sara took Ermengarde's hands. She suddenly felt very happy. Perhaps she cried a little, too. Who can say?

There was only one chair, so the two friends sat on the bed. Ermengarde looked round the attic. 'Oh, Sara, how can you live in this room? It's so cold and—and dirty.'

'It's not so bad,' said Sara. 'And I've got lots of friends. There's Becky in the next room, and—come and see.'

She moved the table under the window, and then she and Ermengarde stood on it and looked out of the window, over the roofs of the houses. In her pocket Sara had some small pieces of bread. She put her hand out of the window, with the bread on it. 'Watch,' she said.

After a minute a little brown bird flew down to Sara's hand and began to eat the bread. Then a second bird came, and a third, and a fourth.

'Oh Sara, how wonderful!' said Ermengarde.

'They know I'm their friend,' said Sara, 'so they're not afraid. Sometimes they come into the room, too.'

Ermengarde looked across the roof to the next attic window. 'Who lives in that house?' she asked.

'Nobody,' said Sara sadly. 'So I never see anybody at that window, and I can only talk to the birds.'

*　　*　　*

But one night, two or three weeks later, Becky came into Sara's room. She was very excited.

'Oooh, Miss!' she said. 'An Indian gentleman is moving into the house next door. Well, he's English, but he lived in India for years and years. And now he's going to live next door. He's very rich, and he's ill. Something bad happened to him, but I don't know what.'

Sara laughed. 'How do you know all this?' she said.

'Well, Miss, you know the Carmichael family across the street?' Becky said. 'I'm friendly with their kitchen-girl, and she told me. Mr Carmichael is the Indian gentleman's lawyer, so they know all about him.'

3 ．新女佣

那天晚上，萨拉穿着黑色的旧衣服，坐在阁楼上她那间狭小的房间的床上。她没有哭，可是脸色苍白，一连几个小时一动不动，也没有说话。

夜很深了，门悄悄地打开，贝基探着脑袋往屋里看。她的眼睛红红的，显然是哭过。“哦，小姐，”她说，“所有的仆人都在谈论这件事。我好难过——真的好难过！”她看着萨拉苍白的脸，忍不住又哭了。接着她跑到萨拉跟前，握住她的手。

萨拉终于动了动。她慢慢抬起头看着贝基。“哦，贝基。”她开口说话了，但就说了这么一句。

住在阁楼里的第一个夜晚是漫长的。萨拉没有睡成觉。“爸爸死了，”她一遍又一遍地嘟囔着，“爸爸死了，我再也见不到他了。”

第二天早上，萨拉开始了她的新生活。她学着拖地板，学着生火，她楼上楼下地跑来跑去，还在厨房里干活。

厨子是个大块头的女人，长着一张发红的脸，脸色凶巴巴的。“看吧，”她说，“家里有钻石矿的富家小姐现在成了仆人，嗯？”她看着萨拉，“好了，我今天早上要做苹果派。下楼到商店里给我买些苹果来。要快！”

于是萨拉跑到商店里拎回来一大袋苹果。接着又把厨房里的地板拖了，还给楼上的寝室里送了热水。

她每天从早到晚地干活，还在学校里帮忙。

“你法语说得不错，”明钦小姐冷冷地对她说，“所以你可以给小孩子上法语课。但你仅仅是个仆人，别忘了这一点。”

萨拉新生活的第一个月非常艰难。她常常感到又累又饿，可她从来没哭过。夜幕降临时，在阁楼上狭小的房间里，她想起了死在千万里之外遥远的印度的父亲。

“我一定要勇敢起来，”她说道，“爸爸一直都要我做个勇敢的人。而且我每天还有一张床睡，有东西吃，很多人都没有这些呢。”

起初萨拉只有贝基一个朋友。贝基每天都到萨拉的房间里来。她们说的并不多，可看到贝基友好、微笑着的脸，萨拉就能获得很大的鼓舞和帮助。

学校里的姑娘们都为萨拉感到难过，可萨拉现在是个女仆了，她们不能跟仆人要好。当然拉维尼娅很是高兴。“我一直都不喜欢萨拉·克鲁，”她对她的伙伴们说，“我当初说那里没有什么钻石也没错——那里就是没有嘛！”

埃芒加德非常难过。她在校园里见到萨拉时，萨拉总是一句话不说就匆匆而过。可怜的埃芒加德非常喜欢萨拉，想跟她好。可脑筋并不怎么灵光的她却怎么也弄不懂萨拉为什么会这样。

一天早上，她起得非常早，悄悄下了床，来到楼上的阁间，推开了萨拉的房门。

“埃芒加德！”萨拉叫道，“你来这里干什么？”

埃芒加德哭了起来。“哦，萨拉，请告诉我，究竟 出什么事了？你现在怎么不喜欢我了？”

“我是 很喜欢你，”萨拉说，“我当然喜欢你。可是，你知道吗，现在一切都不一样了。明钦老师不让我跟女孩子们说话。大部分女孩子也不愿意跟我说话。我想可能你也不愿意……”

“可我是你的朋友 呀！”埃芒加德哭着说，“我要永远 和你做朋友——谁 也阻止不了我！”

萨拉握住埃芒加德的手。她突然感到非常幸福，不过也许她也在暗自神伤。谁又能说得准呢？

房间里只有一把椅子，于是两个好朋友就坐在床上。埃芒加德环顾狭小的房间。“哦，萨拉，你怎么住这个房间？又冷又——又脏的。”

“这里还可以，”萨拉说，“我还有很多朋友。贝基就住在隔壁，还有——快来看。”

她把桌子移到窗户底下，和埃芒加德一起站上去，从窗口向外看到了房子的屋顶。萨拉口袋里装着一些面包屑。她把面包屑放在手上，从窗口伸了出去。“看！”她说。

过了一会儿，一只棕色的小鸟飞下来落在了萨拉的手上，吃起了她手上的面包屑。然后又来了第二只，第三只，第四只。

“哦，萨拉，太棒了！”埃芒加德说道。

“它们知道我是它们的朋友，”萨拉说，“所以它们不怕我。有时它们还进屋来呢。”

埃芒加德从屋顶上向隔壁小阁屋的窗子望去。“谁住在那个房子里呀？”她问道。

“没有人住，”萨拉难过地说，“我从来没有看到那扇窗子里有人，我只能跟这些鸟儿说说话。”

*　　*　　*

可是，两三个星期后的一天晚上，贝基来到萨拉的房间。她非常兴奋。

“嚯，小姐！”她说，“有个印度绅士要搬到隔壁的房子里住了。对了，他是个英国人，但是在印度生活了好多年。现在他马上就要住在隔壁了。他非常有钱，不过他生病了。好像有什么不幸的事发生在他的身上，可我不知道是什么事。”

萨拉笑了。“你是怎么知道这些的？”她问道。

“是这样的，小姐，你知道住在街对面的卡迈克尔一家吗？”贝基说，“我跟那家厨房的女佣很要好，这事是她告诉我的。卡迈克尔先生是那个印度绅士的律师，所以他们对他的情况都很了解。”

Ram Dass and the monkey

Every morning, when Sara gave the birds their bread, she looked across to the attic window next door. But nobody opened it. Nobody called out 'Good morning!' across the roof, or gave Sara a friendly smile.

'Perhaps the Indian gentleman's servants all sleep downstairs,' she thought sadly.

Her life was very lonely now. She saw Becky every day, of course, but they did not have much time for talking. The cook and the other servants were not friendly. Sometimes, at night, Ermengarde came up to Sara's room, but it was not easy for her to come often.

Then one evening, Sara was in her attic when she heard a noise on the roof. She looked up — and there at the open window was a small monkey.

'Oh, you dear little thing!' cried Sara.

At once, the monkey jumped down and began to run round the room. Sara laughed. She got up on the table and looked out of her window, and at the next window she saw a face—the smiling face of an Indian lascar.

'Oh,' cried Sara, 'have you got a monkey? He's in my room.'

The lascar's name was Ram Dass, and yes, it was his monkey. He gave Sara a big smile.

'I'm so sorry,' he said. 'Can I come and get him?'

'Oh yes, please,' said Sara. 'I think he's afraid of me. And he runs so fast! But can you get across the roof?'

Yes, Ram Dass could, and a minute later he was in Sara's room. Soon the monkey jumped into his arms, and Ram Dass thanked Sara again and again. Then he went away, across the roof, back into the house next door.

*　　*　　*

Sara went to the shops five or six times a day, and when she walked past the house next door, she often thought about the Indian gentleman. She felt sorry for him. He had no wife or family, and the doctor visited the house every day. Mr Carmichael the lawyer often visited, too, and sometimes the Carmichael children went with him.

Sara was pleased about that. 'It's nice to see friendly faces when you are ill,' she thought.

The Indian gentleman thought that, too. He liked children very much, but he was a very unhappy man. Mr Carmichael was his friend, and he talked to him a lot. But they talked about only one thing.

'I must find the child,' said the Indian gentleman (his name was Mr Carrisford). 'I must find her and take care of her. But where is she? Here I am, with all this money from the diamond mines—and half of it is Ralph Crewe's money. Oh, Carmichael, why did I leave my friend and run away when things looked bad? Why?'

'You ran away because you were ill with a fever,' said Mr Carmichael. 'It nearly killed you, remember?'

'And it did kill poor Ralph,' said Mr Carrisford. 'He put all his money into the mines because I was his friend. But at first we didn't find any diamonds, and all Ralph's money was gone. I was afraid to tell him, so I ran away. And later, when we did find diamonds, Ralph was dead.' He laughed, angrily. 'What a brave friend I was!'

'It's not easy to be brave,' Mr Carmichael said quietly, 'when you're ill with a fever.'

Mr Carrisford looked into the fire. 'Ram Dass tells me,' he said, 'about a little servant-girl next door. The monkey ran away, and Ram Dass went across the roof to get him back from her room. The poor child sleeps in a cold, dirty attic, and works about sixteen hours a day. Is Ralph's daughter living like that? I can't stop thinking about it.'

'We're going to find her one day,' said Mr Carmichael.

'But how?' said Mr Carrisford. He put his head in his hands. 'I never saw her. I don't know her name! Ralph always called her his "Little Missus". We talked all the time about the mines. He never told me the name of her school. Her mother was French, so did he take her to a school in France? Or was it in England?'

'Well, we know there was a child at a school in Paris,' said Mr Carmichael, 'with the name of Carew or Crewe. Her father died suddenly, and a Russian family took her away with them, because she was a friend of their daughter. Perhaps this girl is Ralph Crewe's child. Next week I'm going to Moscow to look for her.'

'I want to go with you, but I'm not well,' said Mr Carrisford. 'I must find her, Carmichael. I must. Every night, in my dreams, I see Ralph Crewe's face, and he says:"Tom, Tom, where is my Little Missus?" And I have no answer for him.' Mr Carrisford took his friend's hand. 'Help me to find her. Help me.'

*　　*　　*

Winter came, with its short, dark days, and the attic rooms were very cold. There were no fires for servant girls, and often Sara and Becky could not sleep because of the cold. Sara was taller now, and her old black dress was very short. Her shoes were old, and she had no warm coat for the winter weather. She was thin, too. She did not get very much to eat, and she was always hungry.

She carried big baskets of shopping through the rain and the snow. One day she found a sixpence in the snow, and she bought some hot new bread with it. Then she saw a child by the door of the shop. The child had no shoes and no coat, and her thin face was blue with cold.

'She is hungrier than I am,' thought Sara. And she gave her hot new bread to the child.

When she got back to the school, Miss Minchin was angry. 'Cook is waiting for you, Sara. Why are you late?'

'I can't walk quickly through the snow,' said Sara. 'My shoes are old, Miss Minchin, and my feet get very cold.'

Miss Minchin did not like to hear this. 'Don't speak to me like that!' she said. 'I am kind to you, I'm giving you a home, but you never say "thank you" to me.'

Sara looked at her. 'You are not kind,' she said quietly. 'And this is not a home.'

'Go to your room at once!' said Miss Minchin.

On the stairs Sara met Lavinia. Lavinia looked at her and gave a little laugh. 'Oh, here's Princess Sara,' she said, 'in her old dress and her dirty shoes!'

In the attic, Sara sat down on the chair by her table.

'I must be brave,' she whispered. 'A princess is always brave, so I must be, too. But it's not easy.' She put her head down on her arms. 'Oh, Father, do you remember your Little Missus? Can you see me now?'

And in the house next door Mr Carrisford sat by a warm fire. Moscow is a long way from London, and he could only wait, but he thought about Ralph Crewe's child every day. He thought about other children, too.

'Ram Dass,' he said. 'How is that poor little servant-girl next door? Can we do something for her?'

'I see her in the street every day,' said Ram Dass. 'In the rain, in the snow. She looks thin and hungry. But we can help her. I can easily get in through her attic window. Listen...' And he talked for some minutes.

Mr Carrisford smiled. 'Yes,' he said to Ram Dass. 'Yes, I like it. Let's do it.'

4 ．拉姆·达斯和猴子

每天早晨当萨拉给鸟儿喂面包的时候，她都要看看隔壁阁楼的窗子。可没有人打开窗子，没有人隔着屋顶向她说“早上好！”，也没有人给她以友好的微笑。

“可能印度绅士的仆人们全都睡在楼下。”她难过地想。

她如今生活得非常孤独。她每天都去看贝基，不过，她们当然没有多少时间在一起聊天。厨子还有其他仆人并不友好。有时，埃芒加德会在晚上来萨拉的屋里看她，可她并不能经常来。

一天晚上，萨拉正在屋里待着，这时她听到房顶上有什么动静。她抬头看去——只见开着的窗户上有一只小猴子。

“哦，你这可爱的小家伙！”萨拉叫了出来。

那只猴子立刻跳了下来，开始在屋子里跑来跑去。萨拉笑了。她站到桌子上透过窗户向外看去，看到隔壁窗户里有一张脸——一张东印度水手微笑着的脸。

“哦，”萨拉叫道，“你是不是有一只猴子？它在我屋里呢。”

东印度水手名叫拉姆·达斯，是的，那猴子就是他的。他冲萨拉灿烂地笑着。

“对不起，”他说道，“我可以进来逮住它吗？”

“哦，当然可以，请吧，”萨拉回答，“我想它有点儿怕我。它跑得真快！可你能从屋顶上过来吗？”

是的，拉姆·达斯可以，一转眼的工夫他就来到了萨拉的屋里。那只猴子立即就跳到了他胳膊上，拉姆·达斯一遍又一遍地向萨拉道谢。接着他从屋顶走回到了隔壁的房子里。

*　　*　　*

萨拉一天要去五六趟商店，每当她经过隔壁的房子时，就会经常想起那个印度绅士。她很为他感到难过。他没有妻室，大夫每天都去看他。律师卡迈克尔先生也经常去看他，有时候还带着他家的孩子们。

萨拉为此感到高兴。“生病时能看到人们友善的面庞真好。”她这样想。

那个印度绅士也是这么想的。他非常喜欢孩子，可他是个非常不幸的人。卡迈克尔先生是他的朋友，他跟他谈了很多话，可他们只谈论一件事情。

“我一定要 找到那个孩子，”印度绅士（他名叫卡里斯福特）说道，“我一定要找到她并照顾她。可她在哪儿呢？我带着所有开采钻石矿赚来的钱来到这里——那笔钱有一半是拉尔夫·克鲁的。哦，卡迈克尔，为什么当时形势看起来不好时我要丢下我的朋友逃跑呢？为什么？”

“你出走是因为你当时生病发烧了，”卡迈克尔先生说道，“还记得吗？那场病差点要了你的命。”

“那场病的确 要了可怜的拉尔夫的命，”卡里斯福特先生说，“因为我是他的朋友，他把他所有的钱都投在了那个钻石矿上。可一开始我们根本找不到钻石，拉尔夫的钱全赔进去了。我不敢把这事告诉他，所以就一走了之。后来，当我们真的 找到钻石的时候，拉尔夫已经死了。”他生气地冷笑着，“我真是个勇敢的朋友！”

“要想真正勇敢起来并不容易，”卡迈克尔心平气和地说道，“特别是在你生病发烧的时候。”

卡里斯福特先生看着炉火。“拉姆·达斯告诉我，”他说，“隔壁有个小女佣。拉姆·达斯的猴子跑了，他沿着屋顶过去把猴子从她屋里捉了回来。可怜的小女孩儿住在又冷又脏的小阁屋里，每天干大约16个小时的活。拉尔夫的女儿也过这样的日子吗？我老是禁不住那样想。”

“我们总有一天会找到她的。”卡迈克尔先生说道。

“可怎么找呢？”卡里斯福特先生说。他用手抱着头，“我从没见过她，我连她的名字都不知道！拉尔夫经常管她叫他的‘小米萨斯’。我们在一起时说的也都是采矿的事。他从来没跟我说过她所在学校的名字。她母亲是法国人，那他是不是把她送到法国的学校了？还是就在英国呢？”

“对了，我们得知巴黎的一所学校里有个孩子，”卡迈克尔先生说，“叫卡鲁还是克鲁的，她父亲突然去世了，一个俄国家庭收养了她，把她带走了，因为她是他们家女儿的朋友。也许这个女孩儿就是拉尔夫·克鲁的孩子。我下周就去莫斯科找她。”

“我想跟你一起去，可我身体不好，”卡里斯福特先生说，“我必须找到她，卡迈克尔。我必须找到她。每天晚上我都梦到克鲁的脸，他对我说：‘汤姆，汤姆，我的小米萨斯在哪里？’我都无言以对。”卡里斯福特先生握着朋友的手，“帮我找到她。帮帮我。”

*　　*　　*

冬天来了，天变得很短，很阴暗，小阁屋里非常冷。女仆们的屋子里没有火取暖，萨拉和贝基经常被冻得睡不着觉。萨拉现在长高了，她那件黑色的旧衣服显得非常短。她的鞋旧了，也没有冬天穿的棉衣。她还很瘦，没有多少东两吃，经常挨饿。

她经常拎着买东西的篮子雨里雪里地跑来跑去。一天她在雪地里发现了6便士，于是就用这点钱买了一些新烤出来的热面包。可后来她在商店门口看到一个小孩儿，没穿鞋子，也没有外套，消瘦的脸冻得发紫。

“她肯定比我更饿。”萨拉想。于是她就把热面包给了那个孩子。

当她回到学校的时候，明钦小姐很生气。“厨子等着你呢，萨拉。你怎么这么晚才回来？”

“在雪地里我走不快，”萨拉说道，“我的鞋子旧了，明钦小姐，我的脚冷极了。”

明钦小姐不喜欢听到这些。“不准那样跟我说话！”她说道，“我对你不薄，我给了你一个家，可你从来都没对我说声‘谢谢’。”

萨拉看了看她。“你对我不 好，”她平静地说，“这里也不是 一个家。”

“马上回你的房间去！”明钦小姐说道。

萨拉在楼梯上碰到了拉维尼娅。拉维尼娅看了她一眼，还轻蔑地笑了一声。“哦，这不是萨拉公主吗，”她说道，“穿着旧衣服和脏鞋子的萨拉公主！”

在小阁屋里，萨拉坐在桌旁的椅子上。

“我一定要勇敢起来，”她轻声对自己说，“公主从来都是勇敢的，所以我也要勇敢起来。可做到这个并不容易。”她把头枕在胳膊上，“哦，爸爸，你还记得你的小米萨斯吗？你现在能看到我吗？”

在隔壁房子里，卡里斯福特先生坐在温暖的炉火旁。莫斯科离伦敦很远，他只能等待，可他每天都在想拉尔夫·克鲁的女儿，他也想起其他的孩子。

“拉姆·达斯，”他说，“隔壁那个可怜的小女佣怎么样了？我们能为她做些什么吗？”

“我每天都在街上见到她，”拉姆·达斯说，“不管下雨还是下雪。她看起来很瘦弱，也很饿。可我们能够帮助她。我可以很容易地从她小阁屋的窗子爬过去找她。听着……”接着他们在一起商量了一会儿。

卡里斯福特先生笑了。“行！”他对拉姆·达斯说道，“行，我觉得可以。就那样做吧。”

The magic

One night, a week later, Ermengarde got quietly out of bed and went upstairs to the attic. Sara was not there, so Ermengarde sat on the bed and waited. At ten o'clock Sara came slowly up the stairs and into the room.

Ermengarde looked at her. 'Oh, Sara!' she cried. 'Are you ill? Your face is white, and you look so tired!'

'It was a hard day, Ermie,' said Sara. She sat down. 'Miss Minchin was angry with Cook. Then Cook was angry with us. Becky and I had no dinner and no tea.'

'Does that happen often?' said Ermengarde unhappily. 'You never told me. Are you—are you hungry now?'

Sara looked at her. 'Yes,' she whispered. 'Yes, I am. I would like to eat that table. I would like to eat you .'

Ermengarde jumped up. 'Sara,' she cried. 'I had a box of things from home today. There's a big cake in it. I'm going to get it—now! You and Becky can eat it all!'

Soon, Ermengarde was back. The three girls sat on Sara's bed, and there were some happy smiles when Ermengarde opened her box and took out the cake.

'Oh, Miss, look at that!' said Becky.

'You are kind , Ermie,' said Sara. She laughed. 'It's magic, you know. When things are very bad, something nice always happens. Here we are, having a party!'

Ermengarde gave Sara and Becky some cake, and they began to eat. Suddenly, they stopped. There was a noise of feet on the stairs. They listened.

'Oh no!' whispered Becky. 'It's—it's Miss Minchin!'

'Yes,' said Sara. Her face was white again.

Then the door opened, and Miss Minchin came in.

'So, Lavinia was right,' she said angrily. 'Tea with Princess Sara! Becky, get back to your attic at once!'

'Oh, please, Miss Minchin!' cried Ermengarde. 'It was my cake, from home. We're only having a party.'

'Go back to your room, Ermengarde,' Miss Minchin said coldly, 'and take these things with you. And tomorrow' —she looked at Sara— ' there's no breakfast, no dinner, and no tea for you. Remember that!'

*　　*　　*

Soon the attics were quiet again. Tired and hungry, the two servant-girls went to sleep. But after an hour or two Sara opened her eyes. Was it a noise from the window perhaps?

'Something is different,' Sara whispered. 'What is it?' She sat up in bed and looked round the room. She looked again and again, and her eyes were very big.

The room was different—very different. There was a wonderful hot fire. There were new, warm blankets on her bed, and beautiful pictures on the walls.

Sara slowly got out of bed. 'Is this a dream?' she said. 'Where did all these things come from?' She put out her hand to the fire. 'No, it's not a dream. The fire is hot—I can feel it. And oh! Look at the table!'

There was a red cloth on the table, and cups and plates. There was hot tea, and wonderful things to eat—hot meat pies and sandwiches and cake, oranges and apples.

Sara ran to Becky's room. 'Becky,' she whispered. 'Come quickly. The magic is here again. Come and look.'

When Becky saw the room, she could not speak at first. Then she said, 'Oh, Miss! What is it? How did all these things get here?'

'I don't know,' said Sara. 'It's magic. At first I thought it was a dream, but it isn't. Look—these pies are hot. Let's eat them. Hot meat pies aren't a dream!'

They sat down by the fire, and ate and drank.

'Oh, those pies were good, Miss!' Becky said. 'And the tea and the cake. I don't understand magic, but I like it!'

Sara looked round the room. 'Oh, Becky, look! There are some books, too. I didn't see them before.'

She ran to look at them, and opened the top book. 'There's some writing here! Listen. It says, "To the little girl in the attic. From a friend." Oh, Becky!' Sara closed the book and looked up. 'I have a friend, Becky,' she said slowly. 'Someone is my friend.'

*　　*　　*

The next morning Becky met Sara in the kitchen.

'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'Was the magic there this morning? Or did it go away in the night?'

'No, it's still there,' Sara whispered back. 'I ate some cold meat pie for breakfast. And the fire was still warm!'

Becky laughed happily. 'Oh my! Oh my!' she said.

Miss Minchin could not understand it. When Sara came into the schoolroom, she looked happy and well. Miss Minchin wanted to see a white, unhappy face, and eyes red from crying. 'How can that child smile?' she thought angrily. But of course, she did not know about the magic.

And the magic did not go away. Every evening, when Sara went up to bed, she found new things in the attic. There were more warm blankets, for her and for Becky. There were pictures on the walls; there were books, new shoes, and a winter coat. And best of all, there was always a fire, and a wonderful hot dinner on the table.

'But where does it all come from?' Becky said one night when they sat by the fire. 'Who does it, Miss?'

'A friend does it,' Sara said. 'A kind, wonderful friend. But he doesn't want us to know his name.'

They began to look at one of the new books, and then Becky looked up.

'Oh, Miss,' she whispered. 'There's something at the window. What is it?'

Sara got up to look. 'It's the monkey!' she said. 'The monkey from next door.' She opened the window, and the monkey jumped down into her arms. 'Oh, you poor little thing,' Sara said. 'You're so cold!'

Becky was very interested. 'I never saw a monkey before,' she said. 'He's not very beautiful, Miss! What are you going to do with him?'

'It's very late now,' said Sara. 'He can stay in my room tonight, and I can take him home in the morning.'

5 ．奇迹

一周后的一天晚上，埃芒加德悄悄下了床来到了楼上的阁屋里。萨拉不在，于是埃芒加德坐在床上等她。10点钟的时候，萨拉慢慢上了楼梯，回到了屋里。

埃芒加德看着她。“哦，萨拉！”她叫出了声，“你病了吗？你的脸色怎么这么苍白，你看起来怎么这么疲惫！”

“今天过得真惨，埃米，”萨拉说着坐了下来，“明钦小姐对厨子不满，厨子就拿我们出气。我和贝基都没晚饭吃，也没有茶喝。”

“经常会这样吗？”埃芒加德难过地问道，“你从来没跟我说过。你——你现在饿吗？”

萨拉看了看她。“饿，”她低声说，“是的，我饿。我恨不得把那张桌子吃了，恨不得把你 也吃了。”

埃芒加德跳了起来。“萨拉，”她大声说，“我今天从家里收到一盒东西，里面是一个大蛋糕。我这就去取——现在就去！你和贝基可以把它都吃掉！”

不一会儿埃芒加德就回来了。三个女孩子坐在萨拉的床上，当埃芒加德打开盒子拿出蛋糕时，大家都露出了幸福的微笑。

“哇，小姐，看！”贝基说。

“你真好 ，埃米，”萨拉笑着说，“你知道，有时候很神奇，当情况很糟糕时，总有些好的事情会发生。来，我们开个聚会吧！”

埃芒加德给了萨拉和贝基一些蛋糕，她们吃了起来。突然，她们停了下来。楼梯上传来了脚步声。她们都听着。

“哦，不好！”贝基小声说道，“是——是明钦小姐！”

“是她。”萨拉说着脸又变白了。

门开了，明钦小姐走了进来。

“没错，拉维尼娅说对了，”她生气地说，“跟萨拉公主喝茶！贝基，马上回你的阁屋去！”

“哦，求你了，明钦小姐！”埃芒加德哭着说，“那是我从家里带来的蛋糕。我们只想开个聚会。”

“埃芒加德，回你的房间去。”明钦小姐冷冷地说，“把东西带走。还有，明天”——她看了看萨拉——“明天没有你的早餐、晚餐，也没有你的茶。给我记住这些！”

*　　*　　*

阁楼很快又安静下来了。两个女仆去睡了，又累又饿的。可过了一两个小时以后，萨拉睁开了眼睛。是不是窗子那里有什么动静？

“有点不对劲儿，”萨拉嘟囔道，“是什么东西呢？”她从床上坐了起来环视着房间。她睁大眼睛，看了一遍又一遍。

屋里跟原来相比是 不一样了——非常不一样。屋子里有一炉烧得很旺的火，床上有暖和的新毯子，墙上还挂着漂亮的画。

萨拉慢慢下了床。“是不是在做梦呀？”她说，“这些东西都是从哪儿来的呀？”她把手伸到炉火上。“不，这不是做梦。火是热的——我能感觉到。哇！看桌子上！”

桌子上铺着一块红布，还摆着杯子和盘子，里面盛着热茶和其他好吃的东西——热气腾腾的肉馅饼、三明治、蛋糕，还有橘子和苹果。

萨拉跑到贝基的房间里。“贝基，”她轻声说道，“快过来，奇迹又出现了，快过来看。”

当贝基看到房间里的这一切时，刚开始她惊得说不出话来。过了一会儿才说道：“哦，小姐！这是怎么回事？这些东西都是怎么来的？”

“我不知道，”萨拉说，“这是个奇迹。起初我以为是在做梦，可这不是梦。看——那些馅饼是热的。我们吃吧，热腾腾的肉馅饼不是梦！”

她们坐在火炉旁，吃喝起来。

“哦，这些馅饼的味道可真棒，小姐！”贝基说道，“还有这茶和蛋糕也不错。我不懂什么是奇迹，可我非常喜欢！”

萨拉环视自己的房间。“哇，贝基，看！那儿还有一些书。我刚才没有发现。”

她跑过去打开最上面那本书。“这里写着字呢！听着，上面写的是：‘送给阁楼里的小女孩儿。一个朋友。’喔，贝基！”萨拉合上书，抬起头来。“我有个朋友，贝基，”她慢慢地说道，“有人是我的朋友。”

*　　*　　*

第二天早上，贝基在厨房里见到了萨拉。

“哦，小姐，”她轻声说道，“今天早上那些神奇的东西还在吗？还是晚上就消失了？”

“没有消失，还在呢，”萨拉轻声回答，“我吃了一些凉的肉馅饼当早餐。炉火还暖和着呢！”

贝基高兴地笑着。“太好了！太好了！”她说道。

明钦小姐无法理解这些事情。当萨拉来到教室时，她显得很高兴，很有精神。明钦小姐希望看到的是一张苍白、忧愁的脸和一双哭红了的眼睛。“这孩子怎么能笑得出来呢？”她生气地想。不过，当然了，她不知道有奇迹发生。

奇迹没有消失。萨拉每天晚上上楼睡觉时，就会发现小阁屋里有新的东西。有更多的暖和的毯子，是给她和贝基两个人的；墙上有画；还有书、新鞋子和冬天穿的棉衣。最让人高兴不过的是老是有温暖的炉火，桌子上还放着热乎乎的晚餐。

“可这些都是从哪儿来的呢？”一天晚上她们在炉火前坐着时贝基问道，“这是谁做的呢，小姐？”

“一个朋友，”萨拉答道，“一个善良的、非常好的朋友。可他不想让我们知道他的名字。”

她们拿出一本新书看了起来，过了一会儿贝基抬起头来。

“哦，小姐，”她轻声说道，“窗户上有什么东西。是什么呀？”

萨拉起身过去看。“是那只猴子！”她说道，“是隔壁房子里的猴子。”她打开窗户，猴子跳了进来，跳进了她怀里。“哦，可怜的小家伙，”萨拉说道，“你怎么这么冷！”

贝基非常好奇。“我以前从来没见过猴子，”她说，“它不是很好看呀，小姐！你要拿它怎么办？”

“现在天已经很晚了，”萨拉说，“就让它待在我的屋子里吧，我明天早上送它回家。”

Lost and found

The next morning, the first visitor to the house next door was Mr Carmichael, back from Russia. But when he came into the house, his face was sad. Mr Carrisford knew the answer at once.

'You didn't find her,' he said.

'I found her,' Mr Carmichael said. 'But it was the wrong girl. Her name is Emily Carew, and she's much younger than Ralph Crewe's daughter. I'm very sorry.'

'We must begin again,' said Mr Carrisford unhappily. 'But where? It's two years now. Two years!'

'Well, she isn't at a school in Paris. We know that,' Mr Carmichael said. 'Let's look at the schools in England now.'

'Yes,' said Mr Carrisford. 'Yes, we can begin in London. There's a school next door, Carmichael.'

Perhaps it was the magic again, but at that moment Ram Dass came .quietly into the room.

'The little servant-girl from the attic is here,' he said to Mr Carrisford. 'With the monkey. He ran away again last night to her room. Would you like to see her?'

'Yes,' said Mr Carrisford. 'Yes, I would. Bring her in.'

And so Sara came into the room and stood in front of the Indian gentleman. She smiled at him.

'Your monkey came to my room last night,' she said, 'and I took him in because it was so cold.'

Mr Carrisford watched her face with interest. 'That was kind of you,' he said.

Sara looked at Ram Dass by the door. 'Shall I give him to the lascar?' she asked.

'How do you know he is a lascar?' said Mr Carrisford.

'Oh, I know lascars,' Sara said. 'I was born in India.'

Mr Carrisford sat up suddenly. 'In India?' he said. 'But you're a servant at the school next door.'

'Yes, I am now,' said Sara. 'But I wasn't at first.'

The Indian gentleman looked at Mr Carmichael, and then Mr Carmichael looked at Sara.

'What do you mean by "at first", child?' he asked.

'When Father first took me to the school.'

'Where is your father?' said Mr Carmichael.

'He died,' said Sara, very quietly. 'His friend ran away with all his money, and there was no money for me. There was nobody to take care of me. So Miss Minchin put me in the attic and said I must work for my bread.'

The Indian gentleman moved in his chair. 'What—what was your father's name?' he said. 'Tell me.'

Sara looked at him sadly. 'Ralph Crewe,' she said. 'He died in India from a fever, two years ago.'

Mr Carrisford's face went very white. 'Carmichael,' he whispered, 'it is the child—the child!'

*　　*　　*

That was an exciting day for many people. At first poor Sara did not understand. But Mr Carmichael talked to her quietly and told her everything—the true story about her father's friend and the diamond mines, and the two years of looking for Ralph Crewe's daughter.

'And all the time,' she said later to Mr Carrisford, when they sat by his fire, 'I was in the house next door.'

Tom Carrisford took her hand. 'Yes,' he said. 'And you're never going back there. Your home is with me now. I'm going to take care of Ralph's Little Missus.'

Sara laughed, happily. 'And you were the friend, too. All those beautiful things in my attic came from you—you and Ram Dass. Becky and I thought it was magic!'

The Indian gentleman smiled at her. 'We were sorry for you,' he said. 'Ram Dass can move very quietly, and he carried the things across the roof when you were out. I couldn't find Ralph's daughter, but I wanted to help somebody. And then Ram Dass told me about this sad, lonely little servant-girl in the attic next door.'

And so the story ended happily for everybody—but not for Miss Minchin. Sara was very rich now, and Miss Minchin wanted her to come back to the school. She came to see Mr Carrisford, but he said some very angry things to her, and she went away with a red face.

Becky came to live in Mr Carrisford's house, too. She was Sara's servant, and she was very happy. She had a warm room, nice dresses, and good things to eat every day. And she loved Sara very much.

Ermengarde often came to visit Sara, and Sara helped her with her school lessons again. Ermengarde was not clever, but she was a true friend. On that first day in the Indian gentleman's house, Sara wrote a letter to her, and Ermengarde carried the letter into the schoolroom.

'There were diamond mines,' she told Lavinia and the other girls. 'There were ! There were millions and millions of diamonds in the mines, and half of them are Sara's. And they were her diamonds all the time when she was cold and hungry in the attic. And she was a princess then , and she's a princess now !'

6 ．失而复得

第二天早晨，第一个来到隔壁房子里的是卡迈克尔先生，他刚从俄国回来。可他进屋时表情非常难过。卡里斯福特先生立刻就知道了答案。

“你没有找到她是不是？”他说。

“找到了，”卡迈克尔先生说道，“不过她不是我们要找的人。那个女孩儿叫埃米莉·卡鲁，比拉尔夫·克鲁的女儿小得多。非常抱歉。”

“我们得重新开始找，”卡里斯福特先生沮丧地说，“可去哪儿找呢？都两年了，两年了呀！”

“嗯，我们知道，她没有在巴黎的学校读书。”卡迈克尔先生说，“我们现在开始搜寻英国的学校吧。”

“是的，”卡里斯福特先生说，“是的，我们可以先从伦敦找起。隔壁就是一所学校，卡迈克尔。”

或许这又是奇迹，可就在那时拉姆·达斯静静地走进了屋子。

“住在阁楼里的小女佣来了，”他对卡里斯福特先生说，“还带着那只猴子。它昨晚又跑到她屋里去了。你要不要见见她？”

“是的，”卡里斯福特先生说，“是的，我想见见她。带她进来。”

于是萨拉进了屋，站在这个印度绅士面前。她朝他微笑着。

“你的猴子昨晚跑到我的屋里去了，”她说，“我留下了它，因为它很冷。”

卡里斯福特先生饶有兴趣地看着她的脸庞。“你心肠真好。”他说道。

萨拉看看门口站着的拉姆·达斯。“我可以把它交给这个东印度水手吗？”她问道。

“你怎么知道他是东印度水手？”卡里斯福特先生问道。

“噢，我知道东印度水手，”萨拉说，“我是在印度出生的。”

卡里斯福特先生突然坐了起来。“你出生在印度？”他问道，“可你是隔壁学校的仆人呀。”

“是的，我现在是，”萨拉说道，“可我当初并不是。”

这位印度绅士看看卡迈克尔先生，接着卡迈克尔先生又看看萨拉。

“你说的‘当初’是什么意思，孩子？”他问道。

“就是我爸爸刚送我来学校的时候。”

“你爸爸在哪儿？”卡迈克尔先生问道。

“他去世了，”萨拉很平静地说道，“他的朋友卷着他所有的钱逃走了，我也就没有钱了，也就没有人照顾我了，于是明钦小姐就把我丢进了阁屋里，说我必须干活养活自己。”

印度绅士在椅子上挪动了一下。“你——你爸爸叫什么名字？”他问道，“告诉我。”

萨拉悲伤地看着他。“拉尔夫·克鲁，”她说，“他两年前在印度发烧病死了。”

卡里斯福特先生脸色变得苍白。“卡迈克尔，”他低声说道，“就是这个孩子——就是她！”

*　　*　　*

对于很多人来说，这是令人兴奋的一天。一开始可怜的萨拉弄不明白。可卡迈克尔先生平心静气地和她聊天，跟她说了所有的一切——她父亲朋友的真实故事和那钻石矿，还有两年来寻找拉尔夫·克鲁的女儿的事情。

“我一直，”后来他们一起坐在火炉旁边时，她对卡里斯福特先生说，“我一直都在隔壁住着呀。”

汤姆·卡里斯福特握着她的手。“是的，”他说，“你再也不用回到那里去住了。从现在起我这里就是你的家了。我要好好地照顾拉尔夫的小米萨斯。”

萨拉笑了，笑得非常开心。“你也就是那个朋友啦。我阁屋里所有美妙的东西都是你们——你和拉姆·达斯送的。我和贝基原来还以为是奇迹呢！”

印度绅士朝她微笑着。“我们为你感到难过，”他说，“拉姆·达斯的动作非常轻，你不在时他就翻过屋顶把东西送过去。我找不到拉尔夫的女儿，可我想帮助别人。后来拉姆·达斯就跟我说了隔壁阁屋里那个悲伤、孤独的小女仆的事。”

故事的结局让每个人都感到高兴——除了明钦小姐。萨拉现在又非常有钱了，明钦小姐想让她回去上学。她去找了卡里斯福特先生，可他非常生气地说了她一通，让她红着脸走了。

贝基也搬到卡里斯福特先生的房子里住了。她成了萨拉的女仆，感到非常高兴。她有了一个温暖的房间，漂亮的衣服，每天还有很多好吃的东西。她非常爱萨拉。

埃芒加德经常来看萨拉，萨拉又开始帮她学习功课了。埃芒加德没有那么聪明，可她是个真正的朋友。去印度绅士家里的头一天，萨拉给她写了封信，埃芒加德把信带到了学校。

“确实 有钻石矿，”她对拉维尼娅和其他姑娘们说道，“确实 有！钻石矿里有数不尽的钻石，其中有一半是属于萨拉的。那一直都是她的钻石，哪怕是当她住在小阁屋里，又冷又饿的时候。她那时 是一位公主，现在 也是！”

内容简介

世界上会发生一些奇怪的事。你能听到各种耸人听闻的故事，但它们是真人真事吗？你能相信谁呢？一些故事永远不会刊登在报纸上，因为政府不想让人们知道它们。但这样的故事会出现在奥米茄文件里。

有多少人知道奥米茄文件呢？不多——在布鲁塞尔恐怕只有30个人知道它。霍克和祖德就知道，因为文件里的许多故事都是他们收集来的。他们过着有趣的生活。一天，他们来到伦敦和一个青年交谈，他告诉他们一个关于某药品公司的离奇故事，但这是不是真的呢？又有一天，他们去苏格兰找一个生活在尼斯湖中的怪兽。当然，世上没有 怪兽——对吗？还有一次，他们在太平洋的一个小岛上，那里的人都在谈论一只宇宙飞船。可是这只宇宙飞船在哪里呢？谁又真正见过它呢？

它们都在那儿——在奥米茄文件里。

THE OMEGA FILES

SHORT STORIES

Some strange things happen in this world. You hear all kinds of frightening stories. But are they true? Who do you believe? Some stories never get into the newspapers, because governments want to keep them secret. And these are the stories in the Omega Files.

How many people know about the Omega Files? Not many— perhaps no more than thirty people in Brussels. Hawker and Jude know about them, because they bring back a lot of the stories that go into the Files. They have interesting lives. One day they're in London, talking to a young man. He has a strange story to tell them, about a drug company, but is it true? Another day they go to Scotland, to look for a monster in Loch Ness, but of course, there are no monsters—are there? Another time they're on an island in the Pacific Ocean, where everybody is talking about a spaceship. But where is this spaceship? And who has actually seen it?

It's all there, in the Omega Files.

European Department of Intelligence

There were two of them. Hawker and Jude. They had no other names. Just Hawker and Jude. They were young, fast, and clever. They worked for EDI, in the European Government.

You know about the Americans' CIA and the Russians' KGB? Well, this was EDI—the European Department of Intelligence. Big secrets. Very strange secrets. The secrets of the Omega Files. They don't get into the newspapers, and most people never hear about them. Most people don't know anything about EDI.

In the early years Hawker and Jude travelled a lot. Brussels, Strasbourg, Rome, Delhi, Washington... North Africa, South America, Australia... No home, no family, just work. They worked for the top man in the Brussels office of EDI, and only for him. He was called Arla. Nobody knew his real name, or much about him. Some said he was Latvian; others said he was from another planet. He always gave the hard jobs to Hawker and Jude. The jobs with questions, but not many answers. The Omega Files.

When I met them, many years later, Hawker and Jude were about seventy years old. They lived very quietly, in a little white house on a Greek island. They went walking, swimming, fishing; they sat in the sun, and slept a lot.

At first, they didn't want to talk about their work.

'We can't,' said Jude. 'Our work was secret. It's all in the government files, and nobody can read them.'

'After thirty years,' I said, 'people can read all secret government files.'

'Not these files,' Hawker said. 'It's a hundred years before people can read the EDI files.'

I looked at them. 'But I don't need to read the files,' I said. 'I can get the stories from you.'

霍克和祖德早年四处旅行，布鲁塞尔、斯特拉斯堡、罗马、德里、华盛顿……北非、南美、澳大利亚……他们没有家，也没有亲人，只有工作。他们为，且只为EDI在布鲁塞尔办公室的最高长官效力，这位长官名叫阿拉。他的真名及其他一切都无人知晓。有人说他是拉脱维亚人，也有人说他来自于另一个星球。他常把艰巨的任务交给霍克和祖德，这些任务通常问题较多，难以解决，这就是奥米茄文件。

多年以后，当我遇到霍克和祖德时，他们已是七旬老人了，恬静地生活在希腊一个岛上的一座白色的小房子里。他们散步、游泳、钓鱼；他们晒晒太阳，睡睡觉。

起初，他们不愿谈论他们的工作。

“我们不能说，”祖德说，“我们做的是保密工作。它们都记在政府的文件中，没人能看到。”

“30年后，”我说，“人们就可以看政府所有的保密文件了。”

“这些文件可不行，”霍克说，“可能要等到100年后人们才能看EDI的文件呢。”

我看着他们。“可我并不想看这些文件，”我说，“我只想听你们讲其中的故事。”

OMEGA FILE 349London, England

London, England

'There's a young man in London called Johnny Cook,' Arla said. 'He's about eighteen. He doesn't have a home, but he goes clubbing nearly every night. Those all-night dance clubs for young people. Here's a photograph of him.'

He put the photograph on the table, and Jude and Hawker looked at it.

'And?' Hawker said.

'He wants to sell a story to a newspaper,' Arla said. 'Some story about a drug company. Find him. Talk to him. What's his story? I want to know.'

Jude and Hawker took an afternoon plane from Brussels to London, and then went to a hotel.

'What are you going to wear tonight?' said Jude. 'Not those old jeans, please!'

'What's wrong with them?' Hawker said. 'We're going clubbing, not out to dinner at the Ritz Hotel.'

'Well, wear a different shirt, then. That one's dirty.'

'You can wash it for me,' Hawker said.

'Get lost!' said Jude.

They had dinner, watched television for an hour or two, and then went out. It was a warm night, with a little rain now and then.

'London weather,' said Hawker.

They found a taxi with a young driver, and got in.

'Where to?' said the driver.

'We want to go clubbing,' Jude said. 'Where's the best place this week? Do you know?'

'Bruno's,' the driver said. 'Or Garcia's, down by the river. Everybody's going there this week.'

'OK, let's go!' said Hawker.

They went to Garcia's first, then moved on to Bruno's. They found Johnny Cook in a third club, called Monty's. It was two o'clock in the morning.

'That's him, all right,' Hawker said. 'Look at his ear.'

Johnny Cook was tall and thin, with long yellow hair and two black earrings in his left ear.

'Johnny! Johnny Cook!' shouted Jude suddenly. She ran and put her arms round Johnny Cook's neck. 'Hi, Johnny! You remember me—Jude. We met last week, at Garcia's. You remember? Oh, this is my friend Hawker.'

'Hi, Johnny. Good to meet you,' said Hawker.

'Hi,' said Johnny Cook. He looked at Jude. 'Did we meet at Garcia's?'

'Of course we did,' laughed Jude. 'I was with Sara and Patti and the others, remember?'

'Oh. Yeah,' said Johnny. 'I remember.' He looked around. 'Are they here tonight?'

'No, it's just me and Hawker tonight,' said Jude. 'Come on, let's dance.'

They danced for two hours. Then they left with about ten other people, and went across the river to a new club. The music there was louder and the dancing was very fast. After two more hours of dancing, Hawker was hot, tired, and thirsty.

'I'm getting old,' he said to Jude. 'Don't these people ever go to bed?'

'You're only twenty-five !' said Jude. 'That's not old. And you can't stop yet. He's getting very friendly now, and we can take him to breakfast soon.'

At seven o'clock the club closed, and Jude and Hawker took Johnny back to their hotel. Jude picked up the phone and asked for three big breakfasts in the room.

Hawker took his shoes off. 'Ah, that's better,' he said. He looked at Johnny. 'How often do you go clubbing, Johnny? And what do you do in the daytime?'

'Not a lot. Sleep, usually. I go clubbing most nights.'

'Where do you live?' Hawker asked.

'On the streets,' said Johnny. 'When I'm rich, I'm going to get a boat and live on that.'

'Rich?' Jude said. 'Oh yes, we all want to be rich!'

'But I am going to be rich,' Johnny said. 'I've got a good story, see?' He laughed. 'I'm going to sell it. A newspaper wants to give me 100,000 Euros for it. They gave me 1,000 last month, and I'm going to get the other 99,000 very soon.'

'Great!' said Jude, 'So what's the story then, Johnny? Have some more coffee, and tell us all about it.'

'Well, you know the Tyler Drug Company?' Johnny began. 'They make drugs and medicines.'

'Yes,' Hawker said. 'It's a very big European company. They've got offices in all the big cities.'

'Yeah, that's right,' Johnny said. 'Well, they're taking young people off the streets, and using them for tests.'

Jude laughed. 'Nobody's going to believe that !' she said. 'Drug companies use animals, not people, for their tests. Some new drugs can be very dangerous at first. Nobody wants people to die from a new medicine!'

'It's true!' Johnny said angrily. 'Think about it. All those young homeless people in London. They sleep every night along the Strand, and other streets. Nobody wants to know them, nobody asks questions about them. They've got no home, no family, nothing.'

'But they've got legs,' Hawker said. 'They can run away. '

'You don't understand,' said Johnny. 'Listen. I know, because I was there ! I live on the streets, right? And late one night, along the Strand, they came and took me and some other people—a boy and two girls. They wanted to help us, they said. Hot food, nice beds, new clothes—everything! They took us to this big house—'

'Where?' said Hawker.

'I'm not saying where,' said Johnny.

'And what happened?' asked Jude.

'They gave us food, and new clothes, and beds to sleep in, all right. But we couldn't get out of the house, and men in white coats watched us all the time. And they put drugs in our food.'

'How do you know that?' Hawker asked.

'I felt ill. My eyes went strange, and I couldn't see very well. And one of the girls—she got very ill one night. She screamed and screamed, and the men in white coats came. I was in the next room and I listened through the wall. "This is very strange," one of the men said. "She had 20 grams of Coplas in her dinner tonight. Was that too much, do you think?" "I don't know," said a second man. "We don't want to kill her. Let's try 20 grams again tomorrow, on this girl and on one of the boys. We can't stop this test now. We must get answers quickly." After that, they talked more quietly, and I couldn't hear. But I didn't eat any more food in that house, and the next night I got into an office downstairs and took some papers. Then I broke out of the house and ran away fast.'

'What papers?' said Hawker.

'Papers with Tyler Drug Company's name on them.'

'And where are those papers now?' asked Jude.

'That's my secret,' Johnny said. 'When the newspaper gives me the money, I'm going to tell them. But I'm not going to tell you. '

*　　*　　*

The next day Jude and Hawker flew back to Brussels and went to Arla's office. Arla listened to Johnny Cook's story, but he didn't say anything.

'So, what do we do now?' Jude said. 'Do we look for this big house and—'

Arla picked up his telephone. 'Come back in an hour,' he said. 'Get a coffee or something.'

An hour and three coffees later they went back.

'OK，' said Arla. 'You can forget all about this. Cook's story isn't true.'

Jude stared at him. 'Who told you that?' she said.

'I want to talk to Johnny Cook again,' Hawker said.

'You can't,' said Arla. 'He's dead.'

Hawker looked at Jude, and then back at Arla. 'He was alive yesterday,' said Hawker.

'Well, he isn't alive today. He came out of a club at three o'clock this morning and fell in the river Thames. When they got him out, he was dead.'

'But—' Jude began.

'Forget it, Jude. The file is closed.'

□　□　□

'And was that the end of it?' I asked, when Jude and Hawker finished telling the story.

'Yes,' said Hawker. 'Arla never spoke about it again.'

'And did you believe Johnny's story about the drug company?' I asked.

'Before a company can sell a new medicine to people,' said Hawker, 'there are years and years of tests. They do the tests on animals, of course. But they learn much more quickly from tests on people. There are lots of drug companies, and every company wants to be the first with a new medicine.'

'About five years later,' Jude said, 'the Tyler Drug Company began to sell a new drug, called Coplastin. It was a medicine to stop some kinds of cancer, and it worked. Everybody wanted it. The company made a lot of money—and so the government got a lot of money from the company in taxes. Governments like rich companies and big, fat taxes. They're not very interested in homeless young people sleeping on the streets.'

'So Johnny Cook's story was true,' I said. 'And he didn't fall into the river — somebody pushed him.'

'Of course they pushed him,' said Jude. 'Dead men can't talk, can they?'

奥米茄文件第349号：英国，伦敦

英国，伦敦

“伦敦有个青年叫约翰尼·库克，”阿拉说，“18岁左右。他没有家，几乎每晚都泡在俱乐部里，就是那些专为年轻人开设的通宵舞厅。这是他的照片。”

他将照片放在桌上，霍克和祖德看了看。

“还有呢？”霍克问。

“他想向一家报社出卖个故事，”阿拉说，“是有关一个药品公司的。找到他，和他谈谈。他要讲一个什么样的故事呢？我想知道。”

祖德和霍克坐下午的班机从布鲁塞尔飞往伦敦。他们到达之后先去了一家旅馆。

“今晚你准备穿什么呢？”祖德问霍克，“拜托，别再穿那些旧牛仔服了！”

“旧牛仔服怎么啦？”霍克说，“我们要去俱乐部，又不是去里茨饭店赴晚宴。”

“噢，那就换件衬衫吧，你这件脏了。”

“那你帮我洗了呗！”霍克说。

“去你的！”祖德答道。

两人吃过晚饭，又看了一两个小时的电视，之后就出去了。这是个温暖的夜晚，偶尔飘落点儿雨丝。

“地道的伦敦天气。”霍克说。

他们叫了一辆出租车，开车的是个年轻人。

“去哪儿？”司机问。

“我们想去俱乐部，”祖德说，“这周最热闹的地方是哪里？你知道吗？”

“布鲁诺酒吧，”司机回答，“加西亚酒吧也行，就在河下游的岸边。这周人人都去那儿。”

“好，就去那儿！”霍克说。

他们先去加西亚酒吧，然后又赶到布鲁诺酒吧。但他们最后是在一个叫蒙蒂的酒吧找到约翰尼·库克的，而那时已是凌晨两点了。

“就是他，没错，”霍克说，“看他的耳朵你就知道了。”

约翰尼·库克长得又高又瘦，留着一头金色的长发，在他的左耳上有两个黑色的耳环。

“约翰尼！约翰尼·库克！”祖德突然大喊，她跑过去搂住约翰尼·库克的脖子，“嗨，约翰尼！还记得我吗？——我是祖德啊。我们是上星期在加西亚认识的，不记得啦？哦，这是我的朋友霍克。”

“你好，约翰尼。见到你很高兴。”霍克说。

“你好，”约翰尼·库克说。他看了看祖德，“我们在加西亚见过吗？”

“当然啦，”祖德大笑，“我那天和萨拉、帕蒂还有其他几个人在一起，想起来了吗？

“噢。对了，”约翰尼说，“我记起来了。”他四处望了望，问：“她们今天晚上来了吗？”

“没有，今晚就我和霍克来了，”祖德说，“走，去跳舞吧。”

他们跳了两个小时的舞。然后他们和其他大约十个人一起渡过河去了另一个夜总会。那儿的音乐声更嘈杂，舞蹈节奏更快。又跳了两小时的舞以后，霍克感到又热、又累、又渴。

“我老了，”他对祖德说，“这些人难道就不睡觉吗？”

“你才25岁！”祖德说，“谈不上老。你现在还不能停下来，他跟我们越来越熟了，过会儿我们还可以带他去吃早餐。”

七点钟的时候，夜总会关门了，于是祖德和霍克带约翰尼回到了旅馆。祖德拿起电话，要了三份丰盛的早餐，让送到房间来。

霍克脱了鞋。“哦，舒服多了，”他说，眼睛看着约翰尼，“约翰尼，你经常去夜总会吗？你白天干什么？”

“去得不算多吧。我白天通常是睡觉，晚上差不多都在夜总会泡着。”

“那你在哪儿住？”霍克又问。

“露宿街头，”约翰尼回答，“等我有钱了，就弄条船，住在那上面。”

“有钱？”祖德说，“哦，是啊，谁不想有钱呢！”

“而我确实 就要有钱了，”约翰尼说，“我有个好故事，明白吗？”他笑了，“我要卖了它。一家报社愿出10万欧元。他们上个月付给我1,000块，我很快就能得到剩下的9万9千块了。”

“太棒了！”祖德赞叹，“约翰尼，是个什么故事呀？再来点儿咖啡，给我们讲讲吧。”

“你们知道泰勒药品公司吧？”约翰尼于是开始讲了，“那儿生产各种药品。”

“知道，”霍克回应道，“那是个欧洲的大公司。它在各大城市都有代理处。”

“对，对，”约翰尼说，“嗯，就是它搜罗浪迹街头的青年，并在他们身上做试验。”

祖德笑出声儿来。“没人会相信你！”她说，“医药公司用动物做试验，不会用人的。一些新药会有毒副作用，服用它们可能会出人命，没人想那样做！”

“是真的！”约翰尼生气地嚷嚷起来，“想想伦敦那些无家可归的年轻人吧。每晚他们都露宿在斯特兰德大街还有其他几条街上，无人过问。他们没有家也没有亲人，一无所有。”

“可他们有腿呀，”霍克说，“他们可以跑嘛。”

“你根本不明白，”约翰尼说，“听着，我了解 这个是因为我去过那儿！我住在大街上，对吧？一天深夜，在斯特兰德大街，他们来了，把我和其他几个人——一个男孩儿和两个姑娘——带走了。他们说，他们要帮我们。有热饭热菜，舒服的床铺，新衣新裤——应有尽有！他们把我们带到一幢大房子里——”

“在哪儿？”霍克问。

“不告诉你们。”约翰尼说。

“后来呢？”祖德问。

“他们给我们东西吃，还给新衣服穿，还让我们整晚都睡在床铺上。但我们不能离开那房子，身穿白大褂的男人一直监视着我们。他们在我们的饭里放了药。”

“你怎么知道的？”霍克问。

“我感觉不对劲儿。我的眼睛出问题了，看不清东西。两个姑娘中的一个——一天夜里病得很厉害，她不停地尖叫。穿白大褂的男人来了。我刚好住在隔壁。我耳朵贴着墙。‘这种情况很奇怪。’其中一个人说，‘她今天的晚饭里有20克的科普拉斯，难道放得太多了吗，你觉得呢？’‘不知道，’另一个说，‘我们也不想把她弄死。明天我们还用20克的剂量，仍旧给这个女孩儿，再找个男孩儿试试。我们现在决不能停止这个试验，必须尽快得出结果来。’之后，他们就压低了声音，我也就听不清了。但我再没在那房子里吃过任何东西。第二天晚上，我设法进入楼下的一间办公室，拿了几份文件。后来，我飞快地逃离了那幢房子。”

“什么文件？”霍克问。

“上面印着泰勒药品公司字样的文件。”

“现在那些文件在哪儿呢？”祖德问。

“这是个秘密，”约翰尼回答，“报社给我钱，我才会告诉他们。不过我是不会告诉你们的。”

＊　　＊　　＊

第二天，祖德和霍克飞回布鲁塞尔，赶到阿拉的办公室。阿拉听了约翰尼·库克的故事，但并没有说什么。

“那我们现在做什么？”祖德问，“是不是去找那幢大房子并且——”

阿拉拿起电话。“一小时后再回来，”他说，“去喝杯咖啡什么的。”

他们喝了三杯咖啡，一个小时就过去了。他们又回到了阿拉的办公室。

“好了，”阿拉说，“忘了库克的故事吧，那是编造出来的。”

祖德盯着他。“谁告诉你的？”她问。

“我要再找约翰尼·库克谈谈。”霍克说。

“来不及了，”阿拉答道，“因为他已经死了。”

霍克看了看祖德，又转向阿拉。“他昨天还活着呢。”霍克说。

“嗯，他今天死的。今晨3点他从一家夜总会出来，掉进了泰晤士河。把他捞上来时，他已经死了。”

“可是——”祖德还想说些什么。

“祖德，忘了这事吧。文件就此收尾。”

□　□　□

“这就是结局吗？”祖德和霍克讲完了故事，我问道。

“是啊，”霍克回答，“阿拉再也没提起过这件事。”

“那你相信约翰尼所讲的关于药品公司的故事吗？”我问他。

“一个公司在出售一种新药之前，”霍克说，“需要做很多年的药物试验，当然，他们拿动物做试验。可是，如果用人来做试验他们就能大大缩短试验进程。药品公司很多，而每个公司都想首先研制出一种新药来。”

“大概是那件事发生后的第五年，”祖德接着说，“泰勒药品公司的一种叫科普拉斯酊的新药上市了。它能医治某些癌症并且效果显著。所有人都想买这种药，因而药品公司挣了大把的钱——政府也由此获得了大笔的税收。政府喜欢的是有钱的公司和巨额的税收，至于那些露宿街头无家可归的青年，政府是不感兴趣的。”

“这样看来，约翰尼·库克的故事是真的了。”我说，“他并非失足 落水——而是有人把他推了下去。”

“当然是他们干的，”祖德说，“杀人灭口嘛！”

OMEGA FILE 451Loch Ness, Scotland

Loch Ness, Scotland

'I want you to take the next plane to Scotland,' said Arla. 'Then get up to Loch Ness. '

'Oh, great,' said Hawker. 'Are we looking for the Loch Ness monster—old Nessie?'

Jude laughed.

'Don't laugh,' said Arla. 'You are looking for a monster. '

'Oh, come on, Arla,' Jude said. 'You don't mean that. '

'This photo came by email from Edinburgh,' said Arla. 'Look...' He turned to his computer and opened a file. 'It's a night-time photo and not very good.'

Hawker and Jude stared at the photo on the computer screen. They could see water, and something big and grey, half in and half out of the water.

'It's got arms and a head,' said Hawker. 'But what is it?'

'It kills sheep, cats, and dogs,' Arla said. 'And perhaps small children next. People in Fort Augustus are screaming at London, and London is screaming at us. Go and find it. '

'What do we do with it when we find it?' asked Jude.

'Kill it,' said Arla. 'Before it kills you.'

Hawker and Jude waited for a minute, but Arla turned away and began to read his emails.

'Are you telling us everything, Arla?' asked Hawker.

'Of course.' Arla put his hands on the table. There were only two fingers on his left hand. 'I always tell you everything. You know that.'

'Huh!' said Jude.

*　　*　　*

They took a plane to Inverness, then drove along the side of Loch Ness to Fort Augustus. It was a grey November day—grey sky, grey water, grey hills.

Hawker looked across the loch. 'It's easy to believe in monsters here,' he said. 'Loch Ness is about 200 metres deep. The third deepest lake in Europe. Did you know that? A hundred monsters could live down there.'

'How are we going to find this thing?' asked Jude.

'Talk to people in Fort Augustus first,' Hawker said. 'Then take it from there.'

They talked to people in their hotel, and to people in the streets in Fort Augustus. Everybody had a lot to say.

'It killed Mrs Fraser's dog,' said one woman. 'She has a house down by the water. The monster came into her garden one night. Her little dog went to look, and the monster killed him—just like that. '

'Killed six of my brother's sheep,' said a man called Dugald. 'He's very angry about it.'

'Can we meet your brother?' asked Jude. 'Ask him some questions?'

Dugald's brother, Archie, lived at Invermoriston, about nine kilometres up the loch. He was a big man, with black hair and blue eyes. He was not very friendly at first.

'Who are you?' he asked. 'Are you army people?' '

'No,' said Hawker. 'Why do you ask that?' '

There's an army laboratory in the hills above the loch. Lots of strange people there. And lots of boats on the loch at night. Coming and going.'

'Mmm. Interesting,' said Jude. 'But tell us about the Loch Ness monster and your dead sheep.'

'It wasn't Nessie. Nessie doesn't kill sheep,' Archie said. 'This... thing... broke their necks.'

'Did you see it?' asked Hawker.

'Well, I saw something big, but it moved very fast. It was back in the loch in seconds. And it was nearly dark.'

'Right,' said Hawker. 'Now, we'd like to look at your dead sheep, please. And then we need a boat. Where can we get a fast boat, Archie?'

'What do you want a boat for?'

'We're going to catch this thing,' said Jude, 'and stop it killing your sheep.'

For the next four days Hawker and Jude went up and down Loch Ness in Archie Campbell's boat. They talked to everybody around the loch. 'When you see this monster, please ring us. Any time. Day or night. Our mobile phones are always turned on.'

They slept a little in the day, and were out most of the night in the boat, with their guns, cameras, mobile phones, a big flashlight, and litres of hot coffee. Once they thought they saw the monster just north of Invermoriston. Another night a call came from a little place called Foyers. They got there at six in the morning. It was dark and cold, and everything was very quiet. They sat in the boat, looking up and down the loch.

'Look,' whispered Hawker. 'Down there, by the trees.'

Fifty metres away there were some tall trees by the side of the loch. There were some sheep under the trees—and something big and dark. Suddenly the sheep began to run.

'Start the engine,' said Hawker. 'Let's get down there.'

When they got to the trees, they found five sheep with broken necks, but no monster.

'It just kills, and goes away again,' said Jude. 'Horrible. '

The next night they were near Urquhart Castle when they saw two other boats. It was three in the morning.

'Those boats again!' said Hawker. 'We heard their engines last night. And the night before. Who are they? Let's go and see.'

Quietly, their boat moved nearer. There were four men in each boat—men in grey, young men with hard faces. They watched Hawker and Jude, and said nothing.

'Hullo,' said Jude, with a friendly smile. 'Who are you?'

A tall man in the nearest boat answered. 'Army,' he said. 'Who are you? What are you doing out here at this time of night?'

'We're visitors?' said Jude. 'Looking for Nessie, of course. What are you doing?'

'There's no monster in this loch,' said the tall man. 'Go back to your hotel and go to bed.' The two army boats moved away, down the loch.

'Nice,' said Hawker. 'Very friendly.'

Arla phoned them every morning. 'Get on with it,' he said. 'Before this thing kills someone. '

'We can't get near it,' Jude told him. 'This loch is thirty-six kilometres long and two kilometres across. There are only two of us, and we're not getting any sleep.'

'You can sleep later,' said Arla. 'Just catch this thing.'

'We met some army people last night,' Jude said. 'What are they doing here? What do they do at their laboratory?'

The phone went quiet. Then, 'What laboratory?'

'The army laboratory in the hills above Loch Ness.'

The phone went dead. 'Well, well,' Jude said to Hawker. 'He doesn't know. Or he's not telling.'

The monster came out of the loch and killed sheep nearly every night. Everybody around the loch wanted to help Hawker and Jude, and their mobile phones never stopped ringing. A lot of people thought the monster was Nessie, but Archie knew it wasn't.

'Nessie never killed anything in fifteen hundred years,' he said. 'This is something different, and it's going to start killing people soon. Look, you need some sheep.'

'Sheep?' said Hawker. 'Do you mean sleep?' He was very tired after ten nights on the loch.

'Of course!' said Jude. 'Clever Archie. Can you get us some old sheep then? Or perhaps we can use Hawker. He's nearly an old sheep by now.'

'Oh, shut up,' said Hawker.

They found a good place between Invermoriston and Urquhart Castle with some trees by the water, and took their six old sheep there. For three nights they watched, but no monster came. The men in grey were out every night too. They were never far away from Hawker and Jude, but never came to speak to them.

On the fourth night Hawker and Jude arrived at their sheep place later than usual. It was a warm, rainy night—soft Scottish rain that never stops.

When they turned the engine off, everything was quiet—just the rain whispering on the loch. Hawker got out of the boat and stood with the flashlight, watching and listening. Jude sat in the boat, with her gun in her hand.

'Where are the men in grey?' whispered Hawker.

'Don't know,' Jude whispered back. 'Behind us, I think. '

Then everything happened at once. There was a sudden noise of boats' engines behind them, and at the same time something moved in the water in front of them. A head and two long arms came out of the water.

'Light!' shouted Jude. 'Quick!'

Hawker turned on the flashlight, and at once the monster stood up and ran at Hawker through the water, its long arms going for Hawker's head.

'Get down, Hawker!' screamed Jude. In a second Hawker was under the water, and then came the sound of Jude's gun—once, twice, and then a third time.

When the monster stopped moving, Hawker and Jude went to look at it. It was a greeny-black colour, bigger than a man, and with very long arms and legs. It had a small head on a long neck. It was a strange, horrible thing.

A minute later, the men in grey arrived in their two boats. They got out and came to look at the dead monster.

'Oh dear,' the tall man said. 'Poor old Nessie.'

'That', said Hawker, 'is not Nessie. So what is it?'

'Visitors, aren't you?' said the tall man. 'Where from?'

Hawker and Jude stared at him and said nothing. Then Jude took something out of her pocket and held it up, in front of the tall man's eyes.

He looked at it. 'Oh,' he said. 'I see. EDI. Don't see many of those. OK, what do you want to know?'

'What—is—that—thing ?' said Jude.

The tall man looked unhappy. 'It is, or it was, one of the army's new fighters. It got away from our laboratory, and we just couldn't catch it.'

'But it was alive... a—a living thing,' said Hawker.

'You can make a lot of living things in a laboratory these days,' said the tall man. 'Genetic engineering is getting very clever. This fighter can run all night, live under water, see in the dark. But it's new. We haven't got it right yet.'

'And it's programmed to kill anything, is it?' said Jude.

'No, no,' the tall man said quickly. 'Not this one. This one just kills small animals with four legs—sheep, dogs, cats, things like that.'

'Well,' said Jude, 'that is nice to know.'

'And where are the other monsters?' asked Hawker. 'For killing men, women, and children—things like that.'

The tall man smiled. 'Can't answer that, I'm afraid. Talk to your people in Brussels. Well, we must get back. Lots to do, you know. Thanks for your help. Bye. '

The men in grey put their dead monster in one of the boats and went away up the loch into the dark and the rain.

□　□　□

'And what did Arla say about it all?' I asked.

'He was so angry!' Hawker said. 'He went crazy! He didn't know about the monsters, you see. Or the laboratory. The army didn't tell anyone in Brussels.'

'And Arla liked to know everyone's secrets,' said Jude.

'Did the army make any more monsters?' I asked.

'Not in Scotland,' said Hawker. 'The British army closed their laboratory after that. The Americans and the French made some monsters years later. They were smaller, like big cats, but with eight legs.'

'Where are they now?' I said. 'You don't hear anything about them.'

'Of course not,' said Jude. 'People don't want to hear about monsters.'

'They're in Antarctica. Or in a place deep under the ground,' said Hawker. 'Nice and secret. Just waiting for the next war.'

'And so there isn't a Loch Ness monster, and never was one,' I said.

'Nessie?' said Jude. She looked me in the eyes and did not smile. 'Of course there's a Loch Ness monster. She's a blue-grey colour, has a small head, a very long neck, and is about fifteen metres long... Go and look at all the photos of her on the Internet.'

奥米茄文件第451号：苏格兰，尼斯湖

苏格兰，尼斯湖

“我要你们坐下一班飞机去苏格兰，”阿拉说，“然后赶往尼斯湖。”

“噢，太好了，”霍克说，“是让我们去找尼斯湖怪兽——老内西？”

祖德笑了起来。

“别乐了，”阿拉说，“你们真的是 要去找一个怪物。”

“哦，行了，阿拉，”祖德说，“你说的不是真的吧？

“这张照片是从爱丁堡用电子邮件发过来的，”阿拉说，“看……”他转向电脑，打开了一个电子文档。“这是晚上照的，不太清楚。”

霍克和祖德一起看着电脑屏幕上的照片。他们看见了水，还看见一个灰乎乎的庞然大物从水中探出半个身子来。

“它有胳膊，还有一个脑袋，”霍克说，“可它是什么呀？”

“它杀羊、杀猫、杀狗，”阿拉说，“或许就要杀小孩了。奥古斯都堡人向伦敦政府求助，伦敦政府又向我们求助。去找到它。”

“找到了怎么处置它呢？”祖德问。

“杀掉它，”阿拉说，“在它杀死你们之前。”

霍克和祖德又等了一会儿，但阿拉却转过身去看电子邮件了。

“阿拉，你把所有的情况都告诉我们了吗？”霍克问。

“当然。”阿拉把手放在桌子上。他的左手只有两个指头，“你们知道，我什么时侯都会向你们说明一切的。”

“嗬！”祖德应道。

＊　　＊　　＊

他们乘飞机到因弗内斯，然后开车顺着尼斯湖的岸边去奥古斯都堡。那是阴霾的11月的天气——灰色的天空，灰色的湖水，灰色的山。

霍克放眼朝湖面望去。“的确很容易相信这儿有怪物。”他说，“知道吗？尼斯湖有大约200米深，其深度在欧洲排第三。说100个怪物躲在这儿也有人信。”

“我们怎么找到它呢？”祖德问。

“先和奥古斯都堡人谈谈，”霍克回答，“然后再抓它。”

他们找旅馆的人谈了谈，又和奥古斯都堡大街上的人谈了谈。一说起怪物，每个人似乎都有一堆话要说。

“它吃了弗雷泽太太的狗。”一个妇女说，“她住在湖边的一幢房子里。一天夜里怪物闯入她的花园，她的小狗出来咬它，怪物就把它弄死了——就是那样。”

“我兄弟的六只羊被它弄死了，”一个叫杜格尔德的人说，“为此他很恼火”。

“我们能见一见你兄弟吗？”祖德问他，“问他点儿问题，可以吗？”

杜格尔德的兄弟阿奇住在距湖九英里处的因弗莫利斯通。他是个大块头，长着黑头发，蓝眼睛。一开始他并不友好。

“你们是什么人？”他问，“是当兵的吗？”

“不是，”霍克回答，“你为什么要问这个？”

“湖上面的山里有一个军事实验室，那儿有许多奇怪的人。一到夜里湖上就有许多船，来来往往。”

“嗯，挺有意思。”祖德说，“再给我们讲讲尼斯湖怪兽和你死掉的羊吧。”

“那可不是内西，内西才不会杀羊呢，”阿奇说，“那个……东西……扭断了羊的脖子。”

“你看见它了？”霍克问。

“喔，我看见一个庞然大物，但它移动的速度很快，几秒钟时间它就钻回了湖里。那时天还未黑透。”

“知道了。”霍克说，“现在请让我们看看你那些死羊吧。然后我们还需要一条船。阿奇，知道到哪儿能弄条快船吗？”

“你们要船干吗？”

“我们要抓这怪物，”祖德说，“以免它再杀死你的羊。”

接下来的四天里，霍克和祖德乘阿奇·坎贝尔的船在尼斯湖上转来转去。他们和每个居住在湖畔的人攀谈。“见到怪物就请打电话通知我们。白天黑夜，什么时侯都行。我们的手机会一直开着的。”

他们白天睡一会儿，夜间的大部分时间乘船出去，带着枪、照相机、手机，一只大手电筒和几升热咖啡。一次，在因弗莫利斯通北部，他们以为自己见着怪物了。另有一天夜里，他们接到一个电话，是从一个叫福耶斯的小地方打来的。他们早上6点赶到那儿时，天还是黑的，天气很冷，四周静悄悄的。他们坐在船上，在湖上四处张望。

“看，”霍克轻声说，“那儿！树丛边上。”

50米开外的湖边有一些高大的树木，树下有一群羊——还有一个庞大的黑影！突然羊群跑动起来。

“发动马达，”霍克说，“我们赶过去。”

当他们赶到树林时，只发现五只被扭断脖子的羊，但没看见什么怪兽。

“它杀死它们就走了，”祖德说，“太可怕了。”

第二天夜里，他们在厄克特城堡附近看见另外两只船。当时是凌晨3点钟。

“又是那些船！”霍克说，“昨天夜里我们听见它们发动机的声音。前天晚上也听到了。船上是什么人呢？我们去看看吧。”

他们悄悄地把船移近了，看见每只船上有四个人——四个身穿灰色衣服神情严肃的年轻人。他们望着霍克和祖德，一言不发。

“你们好！”祖德友好地微笑着说，“你们是干什么的？”

近处的那艘船上一个高个儿男人回答说：“军人。”他说道，“你们呢？这个时候你们在这儿做什么？”

“我们是观光的，”祖德说，“当然，是找内西的。你们在做什么呢？”

“这湖里没有怪兽，”高个儿男人说，“回你们的旅店睡觉去吧。”两只军用船开向湖的深处去了。

“不错，”霍克说，“真够友好的。”

阿拉每天早上都和他们通电话。“继续找。”他总是说，“在它杀人之前找到它。”

“我们无法靠近它，”祖德对阿拉说，“湖面有36公里长、两公里宽，而我们只有两个人，不让我们睡觉了吗？”

“觉以后再睡吧，”阿拉说，“先找到这傢伙。”

“昨晚我们遇到一些当兵的，”祖德说，“他们在这儿干什么？他们在他们的实验室里干什么呢？”

电话那端沉默了一会儿，然后问：“什么实验室？”

“尼斯湖边山里的军方实验室。”

电话那端又不作声了。“哦，哦，”祖德对霍克说，“要么他不知道，要么他不想告诉我们。”

怪物几乎每晚都要从湖里出来杀羊。住在湖边的每个人都想帮霍克和祖德，他们的手机响个不停。许多人认为这个怪物就是内西，可阿奇却认为不是。

“在这1,500年里，内西从不伤害任何东西，”他说，“这个东西就不一样。它就要开始杀人了。对了，你们得弄几只羊来。”

“羊？”霍克说，“你是说睡觉吧？”在湖上转了十个晚上，他已疲惫不堪了。

“当然了！”祖德回答，“你太聪明了，阿奇。那你能为我们弄几只老羊吗？没准儿霍克也能算一个。他现在差不多是一只老羊了。”

“行了，你给我闭嘴！”霍克说。

他们在英弗莫利斯通与厄克特城堡之间发现了一个水边有树林的好地方，于是就把他们的六只羊带到那儿去了。他们接连观察了三天都不见怪物的踪影。穿灰衣服的男人每晚也会出现，就在离霍克和祖德不远的地方，但从不和他们交谈。

第四天夜里，霍克和祖德比平时晚一些来到羊群那里。那是个温润的雨夜——天空一直飘着苏格兰的绵绵细雨。

他们关掉引擎后，四周便一片寂静——只听见雨滴落在湖面上发出的“沙，沙”的声音。霍克下了船，拿着手电筒站在那儿静静地看着、听着。祖德坐在船上，手里拿着枪。

“穿灰衣服的人哪儿去了？”霍克悄声问道。

“不知道，”祖德轻声回答，“我想可能在我们后面。”

一切都在瞬间发生了。他们身后突然响起船发动引擎的声音，同时他们看见有个东西在面前的水里移动，接着一个头和两个长胳膊露出了水面。

“用手电照一下！”祖德大叫，“快！”

霍克拧亮手电，怪物突然在水中直立起来，朝霍克扑过去，长胳膊伸向他的头。

“霍克，低头！”祖德尖叫。霍克一下子就钻到了水里，然后是祖德开枪的声音——一声，两声，三声。

怪物不动了，霍克和祖德走过去看它。它的皮肤是墨绿色的，比人类高大，胳膊和腿极长，它那长脖子上长着一个小脑袋，看起来怪异恐怖。

一分钟以后，穿灰衣服的人开着那两条船过来了。他们下了船，看着怪物的尸体。

“天哪！”高个儿男人说，“可怜的老内西。”

“这个东西，”霍克说，“不是 内西。它究竟是什么？”

“你们就是那两个来旅游的，对吗？”高个子说，“从哪儿来的？”

霍克和祖德盯着他，并不作声。祖德从口袋里拿出一件东西，把它举到高个子眼前。

他看了看。“哦，”他说，“原来是EDI呀。我还没见过多少EDI呢。好吧，你们想知道什么？”

“那——是——什么——东西 ？”祖德说。

高个子看起来不太高兴。他说：“它是，它曾是军方新研制的一种武器，从我们的实验室里逃出来了。我们一直没抓住它。”

“可它是活的……一个——一个生物呀。”霍克说。

“现在一个实验室能生产出许多这样的活物来，”高个子说，“生物工程越来越先进了。它能跑一整夜，生活在水下，有夜视眼。但它刚研制出来，我们还没有进一步完善它。”

“它被生产出来杀一切生物的，是吗？”祖德问。

“不，不，”高个子马上说道，“这只不是。它只杀四条腿的小动物——羊、狗、猫等等诸如此类的东西。”

“呵，”祖德说，“真是 个好消息。”

“其他怪物在哪儿呢？”霍克问，“那些专门造出来杀男人、女人和儿童——诸如此类的？”

高个子笑了笑说：“恐怕我无可奉告。和布鲁塞尔那边说说吧。好，我们得回去了，还有许多事要做。谢谢你们帮我们杀了它。再见。”

灰衣人把死了的怪物抬到其中一条船上，然后两只船向湖那边开去了，最后消失在漆黑的雨夜里。

□　□　□

“阿拉对此有何看法？”我问。

“他非常生气！”霍克说，“他简直气疯了！要知道他对怪物和实验室的事一无所知。军方没有向布鲁塞尔透露任何消息。”

“而阿拉却想知道一切秘密。”祖德说。

“军方后来又制造更多的怪物了吗？”我问。

“不在苏格兰了，”霍克说，“英国军方自那以后就关闭了他们的实验室。几年后美国和法国造出了一些怪物。它们个头小，像大型猫科动物，却有八条腿。”

“它们现在在哪儿？”我问，“你们就再没听到什么消息？”

“当然没有，”祖德回答，“人们总不爱听怪物的事儿。”

“它们在南极，或在地下深处。”霍克说，“悄悄地、安静地待在那儿，等待下一次战争的爆发。”

“这么说，没有尼斯湖怪兽了，而且从来也没有。”我说。

“内西？”祖德盯着我的眼睛，严肃地说，“当然有尼斯湖怪兽了。她有着墨绿色的皮肤，小小的脑袋，极长的脖子，身长大约有15米……去网上看她的照片吧。”

OMEGA FILE 522Galápagos, Ecuador

Galápagos, Ecuador

'Got your sun hats?' said Arla.

'Why?' asked Jude. 'Where are we going now?'

'South America,' Arla said.

'Big place,' said Jude. 'How about Chile? I like Chile.'

'No, it's Ecuador. You're going to the Galápagos Islands, a thousand kilometres out in the Pacific Ocean. '

'Oh, right,' Hawker said. 'Are you going to tell us why?'

Arla looked unhappy. 'There's something strange going on. EDI is getting emails every day from the Galápagos. They're all about Isabela Island and they all say things like this.' He gave Hawker and Jude a piece of paper.

* * * IMPORTANT NEWS* * * IMPORTANT NEWS* * *

A new time is coming for our planet.

The first visitors are now on Isabela Island, Galápagos.

Don't fight them. Don't be afraid of them. Be friendly.

Tell your government now.

Hawker and Jude looked at Arla, and then laughed. 'There are a lot of crazy people out there on the Internet,' said Jude. 'You don't believe this one—do you?'

'Perhaps it's crazy, and perhaps it's not,' said Arla. 'But when we email back with questions, they don't answer. The Americans are watching the island by satellite, but they don't want to tell us why. There are two Australian ships going there. The Mexicans are getting very excited, and the Ecuadorians are saying nothing... Something is happening on Isabela. What is it? We want to know. '

*　　*　　*

From Brussels to the Galápagos is a long way. Hawker and Jude took a plane to Cuba, a second plane to Ecuador, then a third plane out to Baltra Island, in the Galapagos. When they got out of the plane, a wall of hot air hit them.

'Whew,' said Hawker. He put on his sun hat quickly.

They went across to Santa Cruz Island and down to Puerto Ayora. There they found a boat, the Sea-Lion , to take them to Isabela, about 90 kilometres away. At first, the boatman, Gonzalo, did not want to take them.

'My boat can take ten people,' he said. 'It's a very good boat, but very expensive for only two people.'

Jude smiled at him. 'Not for two rich people.'

'Rich?' said Hawker. 'It's not our money—ouch!'

Jude hit him hard on the arm. 'We're on holiday,' she told Gonzalo. 'We want to see the giant tortoises on Isabela.' She looked at Hawker. 'Don't we?'

'Er, yes. That's right,' said Hawker quickly. 'We're very interested in the giant tortoises.'

On the way to Isabela Island Jude read a book about the Galápagos, and Hawker watched the sea. 'Isabela is a very young island,' Jude told him. 'And it has— listen to this ! —six volcanoes. One erupted only two years ago.'

'Oh, that's great!' said Hawker. 'Crazy emails, strange visitors in the middle of the Pacific, and now erupting volcanoes!Thank you, Arla!'

Not many people lived on Isabela, and Puerto Villamil was usually a sleepy place. But when the Sea-Lion arrived, there were about fifty people down by the sea. There were two small boats, and on them Hawker and Jude could see chairs and tables, beds, boxes and bags, and a bicycle.

Gonzalo called out in Spanish to the people on the boats, then turned to Hawker and Jude. 'Lots of people are leaving Isabela,' he said. 'They are afraid.'

'Afraid of what?' asked Jude. 'Go and talk to them, Hawker. Your Spanish is better than mine.'

Hawker came back half an hour later. 'You're not going to believe this,' he told Jude. 'The people here say there's a spaceship on Isabela. It came down ten days ago, right down inside Volcano Alcedo. And it's still there.'

'How do they know that?' said Jude.

'There's an Australian, Dr Jim Miller, up on Alcedo. He works here, studying giant tortoises. He saw the spaceship, and now he's waiting for the visitors to come out.'

'So the "visitors" in those emails are extraterrestrials. ETs. Little green men from another planet. Oh dear,' said Jude. 'Can we go home now, Hawker?'

Hawker laughed. 'No, we can't. We climb Volcano Alcedo,' he said. 'Talk to Dr Miller. Say hello to the ETs.'

'Oh dear,' Jude said again. 'I was afraid of that.'

Gonzalo took them in the Sea-Lion up to Shipton Cove. There, very early the next morning, Hawker and Jude began their climb up the volcano.

'There is a path,' Gonzalo told them, 'but it is five hours to the top and hard climbing. And very, very hot. You must carry water—two litres for one person for one day. You must sleep at the top and come down tomorrow— but not when the sun is high in the sky. And be careful, please !'

'Careful of the spaceship visitors, you mean?' said Jude.

'I don't know about spaceships,' smiled Gonzalo, 'but Volcano Alcedo is always a little excited — she is always doing something new.'

It was a very hard climb. After two hours, they stopped under some trees. They drank some water and looked out over the blue sea. The black volcanic rocks under their feet were hot from the sun.

'It's so beautiful here,' said Jude.

'Mmm. Yes and no,' said Hawker. Then, 'Hey, Jude! Look !That animal, over there by that rock. What—is—it?'

'Oh, wow!' whispered Jude. 'It's an iguana—a Galápagos iguana. Isn't he wonderful?'

The iguana stared at them with its hot orange eyes, and did not move. Its body was about a metre long, and an orange-yellowy colour.

'It looks about a thousand years old,' said Hawker. 'A very strange animal.'

'Everything about this island is strange,' said Jude.

They climbed and climbed, and the sun got hotter and hotter. After three more hours they came to the top, and looked down into the great crater of Alcedo, two hundred metres deep and seven kilometres across. To the north and the south they could see more volcanoes, and across the sea to the west the island of Fernandina—but they could not see Dr Miller or his camp.

'We need to go round the crater to the south,' said Hawker. 'It's another two hours' walk, the villagers said. '

It was hard walking over the black lava rock, and once Hawker nearly fell. Jude caught his arm.

'Don't break a leg here,' she said. 'I don't want to carry you back down to the boat.'

'Why not?' said Hawker. 'I carried you home once.'

'We weren't on top of a volcano then,' said Jude.

At last they saw Dr Miller's camp, and ten minutes later they arrived. Dr Miller was short, very brown, and angry.

'Go away!' he shouted. 'You're Americans, aren't you?'

'No, we aren't,' said Hawker. 'We're European. How do you do, Dr Miller?'

'What are you doing here?' he said angrily.

'We'd like to talk to you,' said Jude quietly. 'About the spaceship down in the crater. Why are you so angry?'

'Because nobody listens to me!' said Dr Miller. 'Nobody believes me! The Americans say, "Oh, crazy man!" The Australian government says, "Get some sleep!" What can I do? Something very important is happening on this planet, and nobody is listening !'

'Well, we're here now, and we're listening,' Jude said.

Dr Miller looked at them, 'Who do you work for?'

'Europe,' said Hawker. 'Europe is very interested in this spaceship. Please tell us about it. '

'Ah, the emails did get through, then,' said Dr Miller.

'Who did the emails come from?' asked Hawker.

'Ecuadorian friends,' said Dr Miller. 'Over on Santa Cruz. Look, I've got some beer here. You want one?'

They sat on the black lava rocks under the hot sun, and drank hot beer. Below them clouds of smoke and steam moved this way and that way across the crater. And was there, under those clouds, a spaceship from another planet?

'Sometimes I think I can see it down there,' said Jim Miller, 'but mostly I can't. It's a great white thing, and long legs came out of it when it came down.'

'But why here, Jim?' said Jude. 'Why into a volcano?'

'Who knows?' said Jim. 'Perhaps they like hot places. Perhaps they need something from the hot lava.'

'And why are you angry with the Americans, Jim?' Hawker asked. 'I know their beer's no good, but...'

'They watched this spaceship on their satellite. I know they did. They know it's here, but they don't want the world to know. They don't want people like you and me to meet any extraterrestrial visitors. Oh no! They want it all to be a big secret. Then they can be top dog. '

Just then there was a sudden noise, a BOOM deep below the ground. 'What... what was that, Jim?' asked Jude.

'Oh, Alcedo does that all the time,' said Jim. 'Then hot water comes up, and steam, dust—sometimes a little lava, but not much. That's why there are always clouds in the crater. You can never see anything down there.'

'Can we climb down into the crater?' asked Hawker.

'Are you crazy? It's dangerous down there!' Jim said.

All evening Hawker and Jude stared down into the crater, but they could see nothing through the clouds of steam and dust. Just before the sun went down, Hawker saw something near the top of the crater and shouted to Jude, but it was only two of the giant tortoises. They came slowly past the camp and went away down the other side of the volcano. Later, four more came past, going the same way, moving slowly and quietly over the black rocks.

'They're very strange animals!' said Jude.

Hawker and Jude did not sleep much. The rocks were hard, and below them they heard again and again the deep BOOM of the volcano. Late in the night they turned their radio on. It was very noisy, but through the noise they could hear a voice from Santa Cruz. Hawker listened hard.

'They're talking about Volcano Alcedo!' he said. 'They think it's going to erupt in the next twenty-four hours!'

Jude sat up. 'Oh no! We're seven hours away from the boat. Let's get moving! Go and call Jim.'

But Jim Miller did not believe Santa Cruz radio. 'It's the Americans again,' he said. 'They want us all to go away.'

'Please come with us, Jim,' said Jude. 'Please. You can come back in a day or two. '

'You two go,' said Jim, 'but I'm staying right here, and watching that spaceship. '

It was a hard climb down. When they got to the sea, they saw Gonzalo with the little boat. 'Hurry!' he shouted. 'Did you hear on the radio? Alcedo's going to erupt!'

Quickly, they went out to the Sea-Lion and climbed up onto the boat. 'Go! Go! Go!' Gonzalo shouted to his men, and before long the Sea-Lion was a kilometre out at sea.

Two hours later Volcano Alcedo erupted. There was asudden great BANG! —and then clouds of dust flew up into the sky. Red-hot lava came out of the volcano's sides and ran down to the sea. The noise did not stop, and with every bang, rocks flew hundreds of metres up into the sky, then fell slowly back down to the ground. For hours the night sky was filled with great flowers of red and orange light.

It was a beautiful, and a terrifying thing to watch.

□　□　□

'What happened to Dr Miller?' I asked.

'Poor Jim went to the great spaceship in the sky,' Jude said. 'Five hundred metres of red-hot lava fell on top of him.'

'And was there a spaceship in the volcano?'

'No', said Jude.

'Yes,' said Hawker.

He looked at Jude, and they laughed. Then Jude looked at me. 'What do you want to believe?' she asked. 'They weren't very clever extraterrestrials, were they?—sitting there in their spaceship in an erupting volcano!'

Hawker smiled. 'Ah, but perhaps the spaceship left just before the volcano erupted. Gonzalo and I saw something in the clouds of dust—a white light, moving very fast, faster than the dust. It went up very high.'

'Well, I didn't see anything,' said Jude. 'And that's because there wasn't anything in that volcano!'

Hawker looked up into the blue Greek sky. 'How do we know?' he said slowly. 'One day someone, or something, is going to visit us from out there. Perhaps that was the first visit, all those years ago in the Galápagos. Who knows?'

奥米茄文件第522号：厄瓜多尔，加拉帕戈斯

厄瓜多尔，加拉帕戈斯

“带你的太阳帽了吗？”阿拉问。

“干吗？”祖德说，“我们去哪儿？”

“南美洲。”阿拉回答。

“范围太大了，”祖德说，“去智利怎么样？我喜欢那儿。”

“不，是去厄瓜多尔。你们要到加拉帕戈斯群岛去，那儿是一片距陆地1,000公里远的太平洋小岛。”

“哦，好的，”霍克说，“告诉们去的目的吧。”

阿拉显得很不悦。“那儿有异常情况。EDI每天都能收到加拉帕戈斯发来的电子邮件，都是关于伊莎贝拉岛的，内容都是这样的。”说着，他递给霍克和祖德一张纸。

* * *重要消息* * *重要消息* * *

我们的星球迎来了一个新纪元。

第一批访问者已到达加拉帕戈斯的伊莎贝拉岛。

不要与他们交火。不要惧怕他们。友好地接待他们。

通知你们的政府。

霍克和祖德看了看阿拉，笑了。“网上有一些疯狂的人，”祖德说，“你不会相信这个的——对吗？”

“也许是疯狂之人干的，也许不是。”阿拉说，“可当我们发邮件询问时，他们并不回信。美国人正用卫星监视这个岛，但他们不告诉我们原因。有两艘澳大利亚船只正赶往那里。墨西哥人也很兴奋，但厄瓜多尔人却保持沉默……伊莎贝拉岛一定有什么事情 正在发生。是什么事呢？我们要知道。”

＊　　＊　　＊

布鲁塞尔离加拉帕戈斯很远。霍克和祖德先坐飞机到古巴，又从古巴飞到厄瓜多尔，然后又飞到加拉帕戈斯群岛之一的巴尔特拉岛。他们一下飞机，就感觉一股热浪袭来。

“哦！”霍克惊叹，急忙戴上了他的太阳帽。

他们穿过圣克鲁斯岛，先到达阿约拉港，在那儿找到一只名为“海狮”的小船，送他们前往约90公里远的伊莎贝拉岛。一开始船夫贡萨洛不愿送他们去。

“我的船能载十人，”他说，“它可是条好船，只载两人费用会很高的。”

祖德微笑着说：“要是载两个有钱人，那点儿费用就不算什么了。”

“有钱人？”霍克插嘴道，“那可不是我们的钱——啊呦！”

祖德狠狠地打了一下他的手臂。“我们是来度假的，”她对贡萨洛说，“想去看伊莎贝拉岛的巨龟。”她望着霍克说，“难道不是吗？”

“嗯，对，是这样的。”霍克连忙说，“我们对巨龟很感兴趣。”

在去伊莎贝拉岛的路上，祖德读一本关于加拉帕戈斯岛的书，而霍克则看着大海。“伊莎贝拉形成的时间并不长。”祖德对霍克说，”它有——天啊！——六个 火山。其中一个就在两年前喷发过一次。”

“哦，太好了！”霍克说，“疯狂的电子邮件，太平洋中央怪异的造访者，现在又添上了喷发的火山群！托你的福了，阿拉！”

伊莎贝拉岛上没多少居民，而维拉米尔港通常是个寂静的地方。可就在“海狮号”到达那里时，海边聚集了大约50个人。海边有两只小船，霍克和祖德看到船上有桌椅、床铺、箱包，还有一辆自行车。

贡萨洛用西班牙语和小船上的人打招呼，然后朝祖德和霍克转过身来。“许多人都要离开伊莎贝拉。”他说，“他们很害怕”。

“他们害怕什么？”祖德问道，“霍克，去和他们谈谈，你的西班牙语比我的好。”

霍克半小时后回来了。“你不会相信的，”他告诉祖德，“他们说伊莎贝拉岛上有一艘宇宙飞船。它降落在那儿十天了，恰好落在阿尔塞多火山口里。现在它仍在那里。”

“他们怎么知道的？”祖德问。

“有个澳大利亚人，吉姆·米勒博士，在阿尔塞多山上。他在那儿工作，研究巨龟。是他发现的那艘飞船，而现在他还在那儿等里面的天外来客出来。”

“原来电子邮件里说的‘访问者’就是外星人（ET）呀，那些从另一个星球来的矮小的、绿皮肤的生物。哦，天哪！”祖德说，“霍克，我们能回去了吗？”

霍克笑了。“不，还不能。我们得爬上阿尔塞多火山，”霍克说，“和米勒博士谈谈，还要和外星人打个招呼。”

“哦，天啊！”祖德又说，“我可不敢。”

贡萨洛的“海狮号”一直把他们送到希普顿海湾。第二天一大早，霍克和祖德就从那儿向火山进发了。

“那儿有条小路，”贡萨洛告诉他们，“可爬到顶需要五个小时，而且很难走，还非常非常的热。你们必须带够水——每人每天两升。你们必须在山顶上过夜，明天下山——千万别等太阳升起时才动身。一定要小心！”

“你是说小心飞船上的外星人吗？”祖德问。

“我可不知道什么宇宙飞船，”贡萨洛笑着说道，“但阿尔塞多火山的情绪总是有点不稳定——她总是做让人意想不到的事儿。”

上山的路很难走。走了两个小时后他们在几棵树下休息，喝了些水，望着远处的蓝色大海。他们脚下黑色的火山岩被太阳晒得烫脚。

“这儿真美。”祖德感叹。

“嗯，既美又不美。”霍克说。停了一会儿，他突然说：“嗨，祖德！你看哪！那里有个动物，就在那块岩石边。它是——什么——东西？”

“哦，哦！”祖德轻声说，“那是一只美洲大蜥蜴——一只加拉帕戈斯蜥蜴。他长得多漂亮啊！”

蜥蜴用它那凶狠的橘黄色眼睛盯着他们俩，一动不动。它有大约一米长，身体是橘黄色的。

“它看上去仿佛有1,000岁了。”霍克说，“真是一种奇怪的动物。”

“这个岛上所有的东西都很奇怪。”祖德说道。

他们继续爬呀爬，太阳也越来越灼人了。又过了三个小时，他们爬到了山顶，向脚下的火山口望去，只见此坑有200米深，直径有7,000米。他们还可看见此山北面和南面的另外几座火山，西面海上的费尔南迪纳岛——但他们却没看见米勒博士或他的帐篷。

“我们得沿着火山口到南面去，”霍克说，“村里人说，还要走两个小时才能到呢。”

在黑色的岩浆石上行走是很困难的。一次霍克差一点儿摔倒，祖德抓住了他的胳膊。

“别在这儿摔断了腿，”祖德说，“我可不想把你从这儿背回船上去。”

“为什么不想？”霍克问，“有一次可是我把你背回家的。”

“但那一次我们可不在火山顶上。”祖德说。

他们终于看见米勒博士的帐篷了，并花了十分钟走到了帐篷跟前。米勒博士个头矮小，皮肤呈棕色。他看见他们很生气。

“走开！”他大叫，“你们是美国佬，不是吗？”

“不，不是，”霍克说，“我们是欧洲人。米勒博士，你好吗？”

“你们来这儿干什么？”他气乎乎地问。

“我们想和你谈谈，”祖德心平气和地回答，“是有关火山口底下的那个飞船的。你为何如此生气？”

“因为没人听我的！”米勒博士说，“没人相信我！美国人说：‘哦，一个疯子！’澳大利亚政府说：‘你该去睡觉了！’我能做什么？一件重大的事情即将在地球上发生，却没人听我说！”

“好了，我们不是在这儿吗，我们在听你说。”祖德说。

米勒博士着看他们，问：“你们为谁工作？”

“欧洲，”霍克回答，“欧洲对这只飞船很感兴趣，请给我们讲讲吧。”

“啊，看来电子邮件发出去了。”米勒博士说。

“谁发的邮件？”霍克问。

“我的厄瓜多尔朋友们，”米勒博士说，“他们住在圣克鲁斯岛。看，我这儿有啤酒，来一杯吧？”

他们顶着烈日坐在黑岩浆石上喝着热啤酒。团团烟雾从他们脚下的火山口这里、那里冒上来。在这些烟雾下真有一艘外星飞船吗？

“有时我觉得在下面能看见它，”吉姆·米勒说，“但多数情况下我看不见它。它很大，是白色的，降落时船身里伸出许多长腿来。”

“吉姆，它为什么会降落在这儿？”祖德问，“为什么在一个火山口里？”

“谁知道。”吉姆答道，“也许他们喜欢待在热的地方，也许他们要从热岩浆里获取什么。”

“吉姆，你为什么生美国人的气？”霍克问，“我只知道他们的啤酒很糟糕，可……”

“他们用卫星监视这艘飞船，我知道他们在监视。他们知道 飞船在这儿，可他们不想让全世界知道。他们不愿让你们和我这样的人和任何外星人接触。哦，他们不想！他们想让它成为一个大秘密，这样他们就是世界上的老大了。”

就在那时，地下深处突然传来“嘭”的一声巨响。“那……那是什么声音，吉姆？”祖德问道。

“噢，阿尔塞多总是发出这样的声响，”吉姆回答她说，“响过以后会喷出些热水、水蒸汽及火山灰——偶尔还会有一点儿岩浆，但不多。这就是为什么火山口处总是云雾缭绕的原因了。因此，你永远看不清坑底有什么。”

“我们能爬下去吗？”哈克问。

“你疯了吗？下面太危险了！”吉姆说。

整个傍晚，霍克和祖德都盯着火山口的下面，可那儿烟雾弥漫，还有火山灰，他们什么也看不见。就在太阳快落山时，霍克看见靠近坑口处有一个东西，他连忙叫祖德，可最后发现那仅是两只巨龟。它们慢慢地从帐篷旁边爬过，下到火山的另一侧。过了一会儿，又有四只巨龟沿着同样的路线，慢吞吞、静悄悄地从黑色岩石上爬过。

“它们真是种奇怪的动物！”祖德说。

霍克和祖德没有睡多久就醒了。岩石太硬，而且火山在他们下面不时地发出巨响。后半夜他们拧开收音机。杂音特别大，但透过杂音他们能听见圣克鲁斯的一个电台。霍克仔细地听着。

“他们说的是阿尔塞多火山！”他说，“他们认为火山将在24小时内喷发！”

祖德一下子坐直了：“哦，不！我们离船还有七个小时的路。快走吧！叫上吉姆。”

可是吉姆·米勒并不相信圣克鲁斯电台。“这又是美国人的鬼把戏，”他说，“他们想让我们离开。”

“吉姆，和我们一起走吧！”祖德说，“求你了，你一两天以后可以再回来嘛。”

“你俩下山去吧，”吉姆说，“我是哪儿也不去，就在这儿守着飞船。”

历尽千辛万苦，两人终于下了山。当他们来到海边时，看见了贡萨洛和他的小船。“快点儿！”贡萨洛喊道，“听广播了吗？阿尔塞多就要喷发了！”

他们飞快地朝“海狮号”走去，爬上了船。“起锚！起锚！起锚呀！”贡萨洛冲他的水手大喊道。不一会儿，“海狮号”已离岸一公里了。

两小时后，阿尔塞多火山喷发了。惊天动地的一声巨响！——一团团火山灰被抛向空中，火红炙热的岩浆从火山口四处溢出来，流向大海。巨响一声连着一声，伴着每一次响声，岩石被抛向数百米的空中，然后又慢慢地落到地上。一连好几个小时，夜空里到处是红色和橘红色的火花。

那种景象既美丽非凡，又异常恐怖。

□　□　□

“米勒博士怎么样了？”我问道。

“可怜的吉姆上了空中的巨型宇宙飞船，”祖德回答，“500米高的火红炙热的岩浆从他的头顶上浇下来。”

“火山口里真有飞船吗？”

“没有。”祖德回答。

“有。”霍克回答。

霍克望着祖德，他们一起笑了。然后祖德看看我。“你相信谁？”她问，“外星人并不聪明，对吗？——居然把他们的飞船停落在一个喷发的火山口里！”

霍克笑了。“哦，也许飞船在火山喷发前就离开了。贡萨洛和我都看见漫天的火山灰里有一个东西——一个白色的光点，移动得很快，比灰尘还快。它向高空飞去。”

“噢，可我却什么也没看见，”祖德说，“因为火山里什么也没有！”

霍克抬头望着希腊蔚蓝色的天空。“我们又怎么会知道呢？”他缓缓地说，“总有一天，遥远的天际会有人或其他什么来造访地球的。或许多年前出现在加拉帕戈斯的飞船正是他们的首次访问。谁知道呢？”

费利克斯是个好警察。警长要他去抓一个谋杀犯，一个很重要的谋杀犯——他谋杀了总统。费利克斯必须迅速地找到凶手，并把他带回来——不论是死是活。他夜以继日地工作，开着车在这个国家来回奔波，也问了很多问题。

但是有些问题是很危险的，最好不要知道答案。而死人，当然了，既不会问问题，也不能回答问题……

THE PRESIDENT'S MURDERER

A good policeman is always asking questions. What happened? Why did it happen? Who did it? When? Where? Why? And a good policeman knows which answers are right, and which are wrong.

Felix is a good policeman, and the Chief of Police wants him to find a murderer. A very important murderer—the man who murdered the President. Felix must find the murderer quickly and bring him back—dead or alive. He works day and night, drives up and down the country, and asks a lot of questions.

But some questions can be dangerous. It is better not to know the answers. And dead men, of course, cannot ask, or answer, questions...

The First Day

'Run!' the man thought. 'Move! Faster! I can't stop now.'

Over the man's head the night sky was black and cold, and in front of him were the trees. Tall, dark trees... five hundred metres away.

'I can hide there,' the man thought. 'I can hide in those trees. They can't see me in the trees.'

He looked behind him. He could see the lights. There were five or six men. They ran fast, and their lights moved up and down. They were not far away now. He could hear their feet on the ground.

The man ran faster. His legs were tired, his body was tired. There were noises in his head, he could not see. The trees were two hundred metres away. He wanted to stop running. He wanted to lie down and sleep.

Then he heard a new noise. Dogs.

'They've got dogs!' he thought. 'Oh no! Not dogs! I can't run faster.'

But he did. Faster and faster. The trees were a hundred metres away... fifty... twenty...

And then he was there. The trees opened their dark arms to him. But he did not stop running. It was dark and quiet under the trees. He ran first to the left, and then to the right. He came to a hill, and for a second or two he stopped and listened.

Nothing. Then he heard the dogs again, but he could not see the lights.

'Don't stop now,' he thought. 'Dogs don't need eyes. They can find you in the dark.'

Quickly he ran down the hill. It was very dark here, and he could not see very well. He ran into a tree and nearly broke his arm.

'Careful!' he thought. 'Careful.' He put his hands out in front of him, and ran more slowly. Then he heard a new noise. Water.

'A river!' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me across water. Where is it? Quick!'

Soon he found the river. It was not very big, but it ran quickly. The water was cold on his tired legs. He walked and ran up the river, through the water, for about two kilometres. Then he stopped and listened again.

He could hear nothing. He stood there and waited. The trees watched him with dark, secret eyes.

Nothing. No dogs, no lights, no noises.

The man was cold now, and very, very tired. 'I need sleep,' he thought. 'Where can I hide?' He looked up at the trees.

'Up there,' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me up a tree.'

He found a tall tree and went up it. He could not see the ground now. He half-sat, half-stood in the tree, and listened. Nothing.

'An hour,' he thought. 'Sleep for an hour. Then go on. Go south. Hide in the day, and move at night. I can get there in five days, perhaps six.'

The man put his head down on his arms, and slept.

*　*　*

'What are you saying? You lost him?' the Chief of Police said angrily.

The young police inspector in front of her was tired. Very tired. He wanted to sit down, but people did not sit down in the Chief's office. They stood and waited, and perhaps the Chief said 'Sit down'. Then they sat down—but not before.

So the inspector stood. 'I'm sorry, Chief,' he said. 'We couldn't find him in the trees. We looked all night, but it was dark and...'

The Chief of Police put her hands on the desk in front of her. 'You had five men with you, Inspector, and two dogs. And you couldn't find him!'

Eva Hine, the Chief of Police, was a tall woman of about fifty. Her eyes were grey and very cold. Dangerous eyes. When Eva Hine said 'Jump!', people jumped. They did not ask questions first.

The inspector waited, and the Chief of Police looked at him coldly. 'What are you waiting for?' she asked. 'Go out and find him! Three months ago this man—Alex Dinon—killed the President of our country. He's a murderer—a dangerous man. Twenty-four hours ago he escaped from prison, and our new President wants him back in prison—today! Now! At once!'

The inspector quickly left the room.

His name was Felix, and he was thirty-three years old. That was young for an inspector, but he was a good policeman. He liked his job, and worked long hours, but he was sometimes afraid of Eva Hine, the Chief of Police.

Ten minutes later he was back in his office, and Adam came into his room. Adam was twenty-five, and usually worked with Felix on important jobs.

'What did the Chief say?' Adam asked.

'Find Dinon quickly,' Felix said. 'So, let's begin. Have we got photographs of Dinon? And what about his family?'

Adam put some photographs on the desk. 'He's got a wife and two young children,' he said.

'Right. I want photographs on television and in all the newspapers. Four men can watch his house and family, day and night—four hours on, and four hours off. Next, I want policemen at all the airports and...'

Telephones rang, and people came and went in the office. Felix and Adam worked on, late into the night.

第一天

“跑！”那人想，“跑！再快点儿！我现在不能停下。”

在那人的头顶上方，夜空漆黑一片，寒气逼人。他的前面是树林，高高的，黑压压的树……足有500米远。

“我可以藏在那儿。”那人想，“我可以藏在树林里，那样的话，他们就看不到我了。”

他回头看了看。他能看到灯光，还有五六个人。他们跑得很快，手里的灯上下扫着。现在，他们已经离他不远了。他甚至能听到他们的脚步声。

那人跑得更快了。他的腿很累，有点体力不支。他的脑袋里充斥着各种声音，什么也看不见。树林只有200米远了。他想停下来，想躺下，睡上一觉。

正在这时，他听到另外一种声音。狗。

“他们带狗了！”他想，“噢，不！可别是狗，我没法跑得更快了。”

但是他做到了，他跑得越来越快。树林在100米的远处……50米……20米……

他终于跑到了。树林向他张开了黑色的臂膀。但他没有停下来。树底下很暗，也很安静。他先跑到左边，又跑向右边。他来到了一座小山丘前，在那里停了一两秒钟，听听有无动静。

什么也没有。而后他又听到了狗的叫声，却看不到灯光。

“现在不要停下。”他想，“狗不需要眼睛，它们能在黑暗中找到你。”

他很快地跑下了山丘。这里非常暗，他看不太清楚。他撞到了一棵树上，险些折断了胳膊。

“小心！”他心里想，“小心。”他把双手向前伸去，跑得稍微慢了一些。这时，他又听到一种声音。流水声。

“一条河！”他想，“那些狗追不到河对面。河在哪儿？快点！”

他很快找到了河。河不大，水流却很急。河水冰冷冰冷的，没过了他疲惫的双腿。然后，他涉水向河的上游走着、跑着。走了大约两公里之后，他停下来，又听了听。

他什么也没有听到。他站在那儿，等待着。那些树，用黝黑的眼睛，偷偷地注视着他。

什么也没有。没有狗，没有灯光，也没有声音。

他现在觉得很冷，而且精疲力竭。“我需要睡觉。”他想，“我能藏在哪儿呢？”他抬头看看树。

“就藏在那上面，”他想，“狗总不能跟着我上树吧。”

他找到了一棵高大的树，爬了上去。现在，他看不到地面了。他在树上半蹲着，听着。什么动静也没有。

“一个小时，”他想，“就睡一个小时。然后继续走。朝南走，昼伏夜行。五天后我就能到那儿了，也许要六天吧。”

那人把头支在胳膊上，睡了。

*　*　*

“你说什么？你让他跑了？”警长生气地说。

站在她面前的年轻警员看起来很疲惫，非常的疲惫。他想坐下，但是没有人敢在警长的办公室里坐下。他们站着，等待着，也许警长会说“坐下”，然后 他们才坐下——而不是在警长发话之前。

因此，警员一直站着。“对不起，警长，”他说，“我们在树林里找不到他，我们找了整整一个晚上，但是光线太暗，而且……”

警长把手放在她身前的办公桌上。“警员，你带了五个人，还有两条狗。而你竟然找不到他！”

伊娃·海因警长是个大约50岁的高个子女人。她长着一双灰色的眼睛，目光冷峻。危险的眼睛。要是伊娃·海因说“跳！”，大家就会跳，事先什么也不问。

警员等待着，警长冷冷地看着他。“你还等什么？”她问，“出去找他！三个月前，这个人——亚历克斯·迪农——杀害了我们国家的总统。他是个谋杀犯——一个危险的人物。24小时前，他从监狱逃走了，而我们的新总统要求把他抓回来——就在今天！现在！立刻去办！”

警员很快地离开了。

他的名字叫费利克斯，33岁。这样的年龄，对于一个警员来说还很年轻，但他是一个好警察。他喜欢自己的工作，而且经常长时间地工作。但是，他有时惧怕伊娃·海因警长。

十分钟后，他回到了自己的办公室，亚当也走了进来。亚当25岁，常常和费利克斯在重要的案件上合作。

“警长怎么说？”亚当问。

“立刻抓获迪农。”费利克斯说，“所以，我们开始吧。咱们有迪农的照片吗？他的家庭情况怎样？”

亚当把几张照片放在桌子上。“他有一个妻子和两个年幼的孩子。”他说。

“好的。把这些照片登在电视和各种报纸上。派四个人轮班全天候地监视他的家和家人——四个小时轮一班。然后，在所有的机场都安排上警察，还有……”

电话响了。人们从办公室里进进出出。费利克斯和亚当一直工作到深夜。

The Second Day

The next morning Alex Dinon was forty kilometres south of the prison. He moved quickly and stayed away from towns and villages. It was winter and the weather was cold, so there were not many people in the fields. He looked behind him often, but nobody saw him and nobody followed him.

At midday he found a quiet field and lay down under some small trees. He slept at once.

At about three o'clock Alex opened his eyes, and saw an old woman in front of him.

'What are you doing in my field, young man?' she said.

Alex sat up quickly. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 'I was tired, and needed some sleep. I'm going now.'

'You're very dirty,' the old woman said. 'Look at you! Where are you going?'

'North,' Alex said. He stood up and began to move away.

'Don't run away. I'm only an old woman.' She looked at him carefully. 'You're dirty, and hungry, and tired... and afraid. Am I right?'

Alex smiled slowly. 'Yes,' he said.

'Well, come back to my house and have some food. And you can have some of my husband's old clothes. He died last winter.'

Alex looked at her. It was true. He was hungry and tired and dirty. And afraid... but not of this old woman. 'Thank you very much,' he said.

The old woman's name was Marta. Her house was very small, but she put some wonderful hot food in front of Alex. He ate quickly, and Marta watched him.

'Oh, you were hungry,' she laughed.

Alex smiled, but did not stop eating.

Marta found some old clothes for him, and then made some coffee. She said nothing, but watched him with a smile. Alex finished eating and drank some coffee. He began to feel better.

'How did you escape from prison?' Marta asked suddenly.

Alex's face went white. He stared at Marta and said nothing.

Marta laughed. 'It's all right,' she said. 'I'm not afraid of the President's murderer. You can stay here tonight, Alex Dinon, and have a good sleep. I don't like the police, and I'm not going to tell them.'

*　*　*

Felix and Adam did not get much sleep. They stayed in the office and slept between telephone calls. The phones rang often, but in the morning there was no news of Alex Dinon. The day went slowly. The phones rang again and again—but there was no news.

'Where is he? What's he doing?' Felix said to Adam. 'He's hiding—perhaps with friends.'

'We questioned all his friends early this morning,' Adam said. 'They said nothing.' He looked at Felix. 'Can we bring some of them in here? With their wives. Then we can ask more... difficult questions. Somebody usually talks then.'

'No,' Felix said coldly. 'That's not right, and you know it. Dinon can't get out of the country now. But we need to find him today. The Chief isn't going to be very happy.'

Late in the afternoon the Chief of Police telephoned. 'Come to my office in half an hour,' she told Felix.

Felix felt tired and dirty. He quickly drank some black coffee, and changed his shirt. Twenty minutes later he stood in front of Eva Hine's desk.

She did not smile, but looked at Felix and waited.

'The police are looking for Dinon in every town and village,' Felix said quickly. 'We're watching the roads and the airports, and the houses of his family and friends...'

'Sit down, Inspector, and listen,' the Chief said. 'We need to find this man quickly. The President is not happy. You're a good policeman, Inspector, and this is an important job for you.'

'Chief,' Felix began. 'How did Dinon escape from prison?'

'That's not important now,' the Chief said.

'But perhaps he had friends in prison,' Felix said. 'Perhaps they know something. I need to talk to people at the prison.'

'Well, you can't,' the Chief said.

The telephone rang on the Chief's desk. She picked up the phone. 'Eva Hine here.' Then she smiled. 'Yes, Mr President,' she said. She listened for a minute or two. 'Yes, of course, Mr President. I understand. Yes. Goodbye.'

Eva Hine put the phone down and looked at Felix angrily. 'Forget Dinon's escape from prison. Get out there and find him. And bring him back dead or alive!'

At the door Felix turned and looked at her. 'Dead?' he asked slowly.

'Dead men can't talk. Now go!'

Felix walked slowly back to his office. There were a lot of questions in his head, and he did not know the answers. 'Why can't I talk to people at the prison?' he thought. 'What did the President say to the Chief on the phone? And why does she want Dinon dead? He went to prison because he murdered the old President. Everybody knows that. What can he talk about... now?'

第二天

第二天早上，亚历克斯·迪农已经在监狱南面40公里的地方了。他避开城镇和村庄，走得很快。时值冬日，天气寒冷，所以田地里人不多。他不时地回头看看，但是没有人看到他，也没有人跟着他。

中午时分，他找到了一块安静的田地，在一片小树丛下躺下了。他很快就睡着了。

大约3点钟时，亚历克斯睁开了眼睛，看到一个老太太站在他面前。

“你在我的地里干什么，年轻人？”她问。

亚历克斯立刻坐了起来。“对不起，”他说，“我很累，需要睡一会儿，我马上就走。”

“看看你，浑身上下脏兮兮的。”老太太说，“你要去哪儿？”

“去北边。”亚历克斯说。他站了起来，要走。

“别走，我只不过是一个老太太。”她仔细地打量他，“你浑身脏兮兮的，又饿又累，……还很恐惧。我说得对吗？”

亚历克斯慢慢地笑了。“不错。”他说。

“那好吧，来我家吃点东西。你可以换上我丈夫的旧衣服，他去年冬天过世了。”

亚历克斯看着她。她说得不假。自己又饿又累，浑身脏兮兮的。还很恐惧……但并不是害怕这个老太太。“太谢谢您了。”他说。

老太太名叫玛尔塔。她家的房子不大，但她却弄了些香喷喷、热腾腾的饭菜，放在亚历克斯的面前。他狼吞虎咽地吃着，玛尔塔看着他。

“噢，你真是 饿坏了。”她笑了。

亚历克斯也笑了，但是嘴没停。

玛尔塔给他找来几件旧衣服，又端来了咖啡。她默默地看着他，脸上挂着微笑。亚历克斯吃完饭后，又喝了些咖啡。他开始感觉好一点了。

“你是怎样从监狱里逃出来的？”玛尔塔突然问。

亚历克斯的脸“唰”地白了。他看着玛尔塔，一言不发。

玛尔塔笑了。“没事的，”她说，“我不害怕什么谋杀总统的凶手。今晚你就住在这儿吧，亚历克斯·迪农，睡个好觉。我讨厌警察，也不会去报案的。”

*　*　*

费利克斯和亚当几乎没怎么合眼。他们待在办公室里，没电话时就打一会儿瞌睡。电话铃老是响个不停，到早上的时候，还是没有亚历克斯·迪农的消息。一个白天慢慢地过去了。电话铃响了又响——但仍旧没有消息。

“他在哪儿？他在干什么？”费利克斯问亚当，“他藏起来了——也许和朋友们在一起。”

“我们今天上午早些时候问过了他所有的朋友，”亚当说，“他们什么也不说。”他看看费利克斯，“我们把他的几个朋友带到这儿来行吗？还有他们的妻子。然后我们可以问一些更……难的问题。那时，就会有人说话了。”

“不，”费利克斯冷静地说，“那不行，你是知道的，迪农现在还逃不出这个国家，今天我们要找到他。否则，警长会不高兴的。”

下午晚些时候，警长打电话过来。“半个小时后来我的办公室。”她对费利克斯说。

费利克斯觉得很累，而且身上很脏。他很快地喝了些黑咖啡，换了件衬衣。20分钟后，他已经站在伊娃·海因的办公桌前了。

她板着脸，看着费利克斯，等他说话。

“警方正在城镇和村庄里到处搜捕迪农。”费利克斯语速很快，“我们正在监视道路、机场、他的家以及他的朋友……”

“坐下吧，警员，听着，”警长说，“我们要很快地抓住这个人。总统不高兴了。你是个好警察，警员。这项工作对你来说很重要。”

“警长，”费利克斯开始问，“迪农是怎样从监狱里逃走的？”

“现在这个并不重要。”警长说。

“但是，也许他在监狱里有朋友，”费利克斯说，“他们可能会知道一些情况。我要和监狱里的人谈一谈。”

“嗯，这不行。”警长说。

警长办公桌上的电话响了。她拿起电话。“我是伊娃·海因。”接着她笑了，“是的，总统先生。”她说。她又听了一两分钟，“是的，当然，总统先生。我明白。好的，再见。”

伊娃·海因把电话放下，怒气冲冲地看着费利克斯。“别管迪农是怎么从监狱里逃跑的吧。快出去找他。不管是死的还是活的，都要把他抓回来！”

走到门口的时候，费利克斯回过头来，看着她。“死的？”他小心地问。

“死人不会讲话。现在就去！”

费利克斯慢腾腾地走回他的办公室。他的头脑里充斥着很多问题，却找不到答案。“我为什么不能和监狱里的人谈谈？”他想，“而总统在电话里又对警长说了些什么呢？她为什么要迪农死呢？他入狱是因为他谋杀了前总统，这是人人皆知的，他又能说出些什么呢……现在？”

The Third Day

Alex slept well for many hours, and the next morning Marta put a big breakfast on the table. Alex ate hungrily, and Marta talked.

'What's happening to this country?' she said. 'I don't know. I didn't like the old President. He was old and stupid. There's never much food in the shops. When did I last eat some good meat?' she said angrily. 'I work every day, and what do I get? Nothing!'

'What do you think about the new President, then?' Alex asked.

'Oh, he's worse! He's a younger man, and he's not stupid, but he's more dangerous. He's very friendly with the police and the army. And he's putting a lot of people in prison. That's not good for the country. We want more food, not more prisoners.'

Just then they heard somebody at the door.

'Quick!' Marta said. 'Upstairs. Hide under the bed.'

Alex ran upstairs and hid. Three minutes later Marta came quickly upstairs. Her face was very angry.

'That was my friend George from the house down the road. Somebody saw you at the window this morning. It was that woman from the post office. The police give her money, and she tells them all the secrets of the village. Everybody hates her!'

'The police always have a "friend" in every village,' Alex said sadly. 'Marta, I'm going now. At once. The police are going to be here soon, and...'

'Huh!' Marta said angrily. 'I'm not afraid of the police or their questions. Alex Dinon? Who's he? Is he somebody on television?'

Alex smiled. 'You're a wonderful woman, Marta,' he said. 'Goodbye, and thank you.'

Marta looked at Alex and her old face was suddenly unhappy. 'Good luck, boy,' she said.

Alex left the house quickly. He went through Marta's back garden, and out into the fields again. He felt better after the night in Marta's house. He thought about Marta and smiled. Boy! He was thirty-three years old and a "dangerous murderer", but to Marta he was only a tired and hungry boy.

*　*　*

At eight ο'clock in the morning of the third day the telephone rang on Felix's desk. Felix listened, then put the phone down quickly.

'Adam!' he shouted. 'We've got him! He's in a village up north. In an old woman's house. Come on. Let's go!'

The big police car was fast, and the kilometres went quickly. Adam was tired and wanted to sleep, but Felix wanted to talk. 'I saw the Chief again last night,' he said. 'She's getting angry. I was in her office and the President phoned her. They want Dinon badly—dead or alive. Why do they want him dead?'

'I don't know,' Adam said. 'Let's find him first.'

In Marta's village a policeman stood at the door of her house. 'We looked all through the house, and there's nobody in there,' he said. 'Only Marta, the old woman. And she's not talking.'

Felix, Adam and the policeman went into the house. 'Hello!' Marta said. 'More policemen? What an exciting day!'

'Listen to the Inspector,' Adam said angrily. 'He wants to ask you some questions.'

Felix sat down and smiled at Marta. 'Now, Marta,' he said. 'Somebody saw a young man in your house yesterday. Who was he, Marta, and where did he go?'

'He was my sister's youngest son,' Marta said happily. 'He's a very nice boy.'

The policeman whispered in Felix's ear. Felix looked sadly at Marta. 'Your sister and all her family live in Australia, Marta. Who was the man in your house?'

'Oh dear!' Marta said. 'I'm an old woman, you know. Seventy-two last month. I forget things very easily. In Australia, did you say?'

Felix asked question after question, but Marta told him nothing. Sometimes the young man in her house was her sister's son. Sometimes he was the young doctor from the next village, but he was never Alex Dinon, the President's murderer. Adam got very angry and whispered to Felix：

'Can I ask the questions?'

'No,' Felix said. He did not like Adam's questions. He stood up and moved to the door, but Marta now wanted to ask him a question：

'And why do you work for the police, young man? The police always put the wrong people in prison, you know.'

'Marta,' Felix said tiredly, 'Alex Dinon is a murderer. He murdered—'

'Oh, I know that,' Marta said. 'The newspapers said that. But newspapers and the television never tell us the true story. Alex Dinon isn't a murderer. He's a nice young man.'

'A nice young man?' Felix said quickly. 'How do you know that?'

'He's got a nice face. That's why. I saw his picture on the television. I'm an old woman and I can read people's faces.'

'So who did murder the President, then?' Felix asked.

'I don't know,' Marta said. 'You're the policeman. You go and find the murderer. But I can tell you one thing. You can begin with the new President. He's got a murderer's face.'

Adam said angrily, 'That's dangerous talk.'

Marta laughed, and Felix opened the door. 'Let's go, Adam,' he said quietly.

Out in the road Adam said, 'Stupid old woman!'

'Yes,' Felix said. 'Perhaps she was... and perhaps she wasn't.'

第三天

亚历克斯睡了好几个小时，睡得很香。次日早上，玛尔塔把一顿丰盛的早餐摆在了桌子上。亚历克斯狼吞虎咽地吃着，玛尔塔则和他说话。

“这个国家发生了什么事？”她说，“我不知道。我不喜欢前任总统，他既老又蠢。商店里从来都没有多少吃的东西可供应，我上次吃的那些肉真是美味，哎，那是什么时候的事了呢？”她愤怒地说着，“我每天干活，但是我得到了什么呢？一无所有！”

“那你觉得新总统怎样？”亚历克斯问。

“唉，他更糟糕！他年轻一点儿，也不蠢，却更阴险。他同警察和军队关系暧昧，他把很多人都关进了监狱。这对这个国家可没什么好处，我们需要的是更多的食物，而不是囚犯。”

正在这时，他们听到门口有人。

“快！”玛尔塔说，“上楼去，藏在床底下。”

亚历克斯跑到楼上，藏了起来。三分钟后，玛尔塔很快地上楼来了。她看起来怒气冲冲。

“是我的朋友乔治，他就住在路那头的那所房子里。今天早上，有人看见你站在窗口边。是邮局的那个女的。警察给了她钱，她就把村里所有的秘密都告诉给他们。所有的人都恨她！”

“在每一个村庄，警察都会有一个‘朋友’。”亚历克斯悲哀地说，“玛尔塔，我要走了，现在就走，警察马上就要来了，还有……”

“哼！”玛尔塔愤怒地说，“我才不怕警察或者他们的盘问呢。亚历克斯·迪农？他是谁？是个电视上的人物？”

亚历克斯笑了。“你真是个了不起的女人，玛尔塔！”他说，“再见，谢谢你！”

玛尔塔看着亚历克斯，她那苍老的脸突然变得神色凝重。“祝你好运，孩子。”她说。

亚历克斯很快地离开了。他穿过玛尔塔的后花园，又走到了那片地里。在玛尔塔家休息了一个晚上之后，他感觉好多了。他想到玛尔塔时，笑了。孩子！他已经33岁了，而且是个“危险的谋杀犯”，但是在玛尔塔眼里，他只不过是个饥困交加的孩子。

*　*　*

第三天早上8点钟，费利克斯办公桌上的电话响了。费利克斯接听着，很快就把电话放下了。

“亚当！”他喊道，“我们找到他了！他在北部的一个村子里，在一个老太太家。快点儿，咱们走！”

大警车呼啸而过，不一会儿已经跑过了好几公里。亚当觉得很累，想睡觉，但费利克斯却要和他说话。“我昨晚又见到警长了，”他说，“她很生气。我在她的办公室的时候，总统来了电话。他们急切地要抓住迪农——不管是死是活。他们为什么想让他死呢？”

“我也不知道，”亚当说，“我们还是先找到他吧。”

在玛尔塔居住的那个村庄，一个警察站在她的家门口。“我们搜查了整个房子都没找到人。”他说，“只有玛尔塔一个人，就是那个老太太。而她什么也不说。”

费利克斯、亚当和那个警察走进了房子。“你们好！”玛尔塔说，“又多了几个警察！今天真令人兴奋！”

“听警员问话，”亚当怒气冲冲地说，“他有问题要问你。”

费利克斯坐了下来，冲玛尔塔笑了笑。“好，玛尔塔，”他说，“昨天有人看到你的房子里有一个年轻人，他是谁，玛尔塔？他去哪儿啦？”

“他是我妹妹的小儿子，”玛尔塔开心地说，“他真是个不错的孩子。”

那个警察对费利克斯耳语了些什么。费利克斯忧郁地看着玛尔塔。“你妹妹全家都住在澳大利亚，玛尔塔。在你房子里的那个人到底是谁？”

“噢，天哪！”玛尔塔说，“你看，我老啦。我上个月就72岁了，动不动就忘事儿。你说他们在澳大利亚？”

费利克斯一个问题接着一个问题地问，但是玛尔塔什么也没告诉他。一会儿说她房子里的年轻人是他妹妹的儿子，一会儿又说他是邻村的年轻医生，反正永远不会是亚历克斯·迪农，那个谋杀总统的凶犯。亚当非常生气，对费利克斯耳语道：

“我可以问些问题吗？”

“不行。”费利克斯答道。他不喜欢亚当的问题。他站起身来向门口走去，但是玛尔塔却要问他一个问题：

“年轻人，你为什么要当警察？你知道，警察总是把不该抓的人关进监狱。”

“玛尔塔，”费利克斯疲惫地说，“亚历克斯·迪农是个杀人犯，他谋杀了——”

“哦，这我知道，”玛尔塔说，“报纸上登了。但是报纸和电视从来不会告诉我们事实的真相。亚历克斯·迪农不是杀人犯，他是一个不错的年轻人。”

“一个不错的年轻人？”费利克斯很快地反问道，“你怎么知道？”

“他的脸很友善，就因为这个。我在电视上看到了他的照片。我是一个老太太，活了这么多年，能够读懂人的脸。”

“那么到底是 谁谋杀了总统呢？”费利克斯问。

“我不知道。”玛尔塔说，“你是 警察，你 去抓那个谋杀犯。但是我可以告诉你一件事情。你可以从新总统开始查，他 长了一张谋杀犯的脸。”

亚当恼怒地说：“这么讲话可是很危险的。”

玛尔塔笑了，费利克斯打开门，“咱们走，亚当。”他平静地说。

在外面的路上，亚当说：“这个愚蠢的老太婆！”

“是呀，”费利克斯说，“也许她很蠢……但也许她一点儿也不蠢。”

The Fourth Day

After he left Marta's village, Alex moved quickly and quietly across the fields. Nobody saw him. He walked and ran, and walked again. It rained all day and all night. He walked through the night, and the next morning—the fourth day—he was very tired and very hungry. He hid in some trees for an hour or two, then he went on south. Always south. To his home town.

'Where can I go?' he thought. 'Perhaps I can escape from the country, but I want to see Olivia again before I leave... or before the police find me.'

But first he needed food. He had some money in his pocket—Marta's money. He remembered her words. You take it. I don't need it. An old woman doesn't need money . Alex smiled. What a wonderful old woman!

He came to a small town on a river, and found a food shop in a quiet street. He opened the door and went in. There were a lot of people in the shop, and he waited quietly behind them. People looked at him, and a man went out quickly. Alex wanted to run, but he was very hungry, so he waited. Then a woman with her young son came into the shop. The woman whispered to the boy, and the boy came up to Alex. 'There are two policemen in the street,' he said very quietly, 'and they're coming here.'

Alex looked quickly at the door, but he could not escape now. Then the shopkeeper called to him, 'Hey, you!' he said. 'Quick! Go out through the back.'

Alex ran through the back of the shop, and the shopkeeper followed him. 'I never help the police—they're all bad,' he said. He opened the back door and looked out. 'It's OK,' he said quickly. 'You can get out of town along the river. Follow the back of the houses. Nobody goes there. Good luck!'

'Thank you,' Alex said, and ran.

Three kilometres from the town Alex came to a road. He crossed the road quickly but a lorry came along at the same time. The lorry slowed down and the driver called out to him, 'Where are you going?'

Alex said the name of his home town, and the driver said, 'Come on. I'm going near there. You can come with me.'

Alex got into the front of the lorry, and the driver looked carefully into his face. 'Do I know you?' he asked.

Alex said nothing, and waited. He felt very tired. The driver stared at him for a minute, then he smiled. 'No, I don't know you,' he said. 'Get into the back of the lorry. Nobody can see you there. Are you hungry?'

'Yes, I am,' Alex said. 'Very.'

'Well, I've got some sandwiches. Here you are. Now, get in the back quickly. Before we see a police car.'

The lorry drove slowly south. Alex ate all the driver's sandwiches and then slept like a dead man.

*　*　*

'We're always three hours or more behind him,' Felix said to Adam in the car. 'We drive up and down the country, but Dinon always moves on before we get there.'

'Perhaps this shopkeeper can tell us something,' Adam said.

But the shopkeeper was not helpful. 'Alex who?' he said.

'DINON!' Felix shouted. He was very tired. 'He escaped from prison five days ago. Somebody saw him in your shop.'

'I don't have prisoners in my shop,' the shopkeeper said angrily. 'And I don't want the police here.'

'Did Dinon come into this shop?' Felix asked.

'Dinon,' the shopkeeper said slowly. 'What did he do? Wait a minute. Yes! Did he write a book about the old President?'

'He killed the President,' Adam said. 'He murdered him.'

'Oh yes,' the shopkeeper said. 'I remember now. It was a good book. But the President's murderer did not come into my shop this morning.'

Felix watched the shopkeeper's face carefully. 'My question', he said, 'asked about Alex Dinon.'

The shopkeeper looked at Felix and smiled slowly. 'That's right,' he said.

Felix and Adam talked to a lot of people and asked a lot of questions in that small town, but they learned nothing.

Later, back in the office, Felix was very quiet. Suddenly he looked at Adam across the desk, and said:

'We can't get Dinon's book in this country. Do you know it, Adam?'

'No,' Adam said.

Felix stared at the telephone on his desk. 'Where is Dinon?' he said slowly. 'People are helping him, but why? He's a murderer. And nobody wants to help us.'

'People never help the police in this country,' Adam said. 'People don't like us.'

'Why are we policemen, Adam?'

'It's a good job,' Adam said. 'And the money's good.'

After a minute or two Felix said, 'Did Dinon murder the President? What do you think, Adam?'

'Well, why did they put him in prison, then?'

'That doesn't answer my question,' Felix said.

'I do my job,' Adam said, 'and I don't ask questions.'

Felix looked at him, but said nothing.

第四天

离开了玛尔塔的村庄，亚历克斯走得很快，他悄悄地穿过了田地。没有人看到他。他走一会儿跑一会儿，然后又继续走。雨下了一天一夜，他在夜色中穿行。到第二天早上——那是他逃出来的第四天了——他真是又饥又乏。他在一片树丛里躲了一两个小时，然后又继续向南走。一直朝南走，就能到他的家乡。

“我能去哪儿呢？”他想，“我也许能逃离这个国家，但走之前我想再见奥利维亚一面……或者说是在警察抓住我之前。”

但是首先他得吃点什么。他口袋里有些钱——是玛尔塔给他的。他记起她的话：你拿去吧，我不需要，一个老太太不需要什么钱的 。亚历克斯笑了。一个多好的老太太！

他来到河边的一个小镇上，在一条安静的街道上找到了一家食品店。他打开门，走了进去。店里人很多，他静静地排在他们后面等着。人们看着他，一个男人很快地出去了。亚历克斯想跑，但是他很饿，所以只好等着。随后一个女人带着她的小儿子进了商店。这个女人悄悄地对她的孩子说了些什么，小男孩儿朝亚历克斯走过来。“街上有两个警察，”他悄悄地说，“他们正在往这儿赶。”

亚历克斯立刻看看门口，但是他现在已经逃不掉了。这时，店主对他喊道：“嗨，你！”他说，“快！从后面出去。”

亚历克斯穿过食品店的后面，店主跟着他。“我从来不帮警察——他们都是坏蛋。”他说。他打开后门，向外看了看。“没事儿，”他说得很快，“你可以沿着河出镇，顺着房后走。没人去那些地方。祝你好运！”

“谢谢你。”亚历克斯说，然后就跑走了。

跑出小镇三公里，亚历克斯来到了公路上。他很快地穿过公路，但是一辆卡车也在这时开了过来。卡车慢了下来，司机对他喊：“你要去哪儿？”

亚历克斯说出了他家乡小镇的名字，司机说：“快点儿。我正要到那儿附近去，你可以和我一块儿去。”

亚历克斯进了驾驶室，司机仔细地打量他的脸。“我认识你吗？”他问。

亚历克斯什么也没说，他等待着。他感到疲惫不堪。司机盯着他看了一会儿，笑了。“不，我不认识你。”他说，“到卡车的车厢里去吧，在那儿，谁也看不到你。你饿吗？”

“是的，我饿了，”亚历克斯说，“非常饿。”

“好的，我有一些三明治。给你。现在，赶在我们看到警车之前，快钻到车厢里去。”

卡车慢慢地驶向南方。亚历克斯吃光了司机的三明治，然后像个死人似的睡着了。

*　*　*

“我们总是比他慢三个小时或者更多，”费利克斯在车里对亚当说，“我们开着车在这个国家来回奔波，但每次我们还没赶到，迪农就又逃掉了。”

“也许这个店主能告诉我们点儿什么。”亚当说。

但是店主并没有给他们提供什么有用的东西。“亚历克斯什么？”他问。

“迪——农！”费利克斯吼道，他非常疲惫，“他五天前从监狱里逃走了。有人看见他在你的店里。”

“我的店里没有罪犯，”店主生气地说，“而且我也不欢迎警察。”

“迪农来过 这个店吗？”费利克斯问道。

“迪农，”店主慢悠悠地说，“他是干什么的？等一下，想起来了！他是不是写过一本关于前总统的书？”

“他杀了 总统，”亚当说，“他谋杀了他。”

“噢，是的，”店主说，“现在我记起来了，那是一本好书。但是今天早上，谋杀总统的凶手并没有来我的店。”

费利克斯认真地观察店主的脸。“我的问题，”他说，“是在问亚历克斯·迪农。”

店主看着费利克斯，慢慢地笑了。“没错呀。”他说。

费利克斯和亚当同那个小镇里的好多人谈了话，也问了不少问题，但是他们一无所获。

后来，回到办公室时，费利克斯非常的平静。突然，他看着桌子对面的亚当，说：

“在这个国家里，我们没法儿弄到迪农的书，你知道吗，亚当？”

“不知道。”亚当说。

费利克斯盯着桌上的电话。“迪农在 哪儿呢？”他若有所思地说，“人们在帮助他，但这是为什么？他是个谋杀犯呀。然而却没人愿意帮助我们。”

“在这个国家，人们向来不帮警察。”亚当说，“人们不喜欢我们。”

“那为什么我们要做警察呢，亚当？”

“这个活儿不错，”亚当说，“还有，薪水也不错。”

过了一两分钟，费利克斯才说：“迪农谋杀总统了吗？你怎么看，亚当？”

“嗯，那他们为什么要把他关进监狱呢？”

“这不能回答我的问题。”费利克斯说。

“我只管低头干活，”亚当说，“我不问问题。”

费利克斯看着他，什么也没说。

The Fifth Day

In an old house in a quiet road a woman waited. She waited day and night, and did not sleep. At nine o'clock in the evening of the fifth day, she heard a noise at the window at the back of the house.

Quickly, she ran and opened the window. A minute later she was in Alex's arms. They did not speak for a long time.

Then they talked quietly about their friends and their family. 'The children are with my sister,' Olivia said. 'It's better for them there. But I came here to Rudi's house. Rudi's away, and Pauli told me this was the best place to wait. I wanted to see you before you leave the country. Oh Alex, I'm so afraid for you.'

'Yes, escape is going to be difficult,' Alex said. 'I talked to Pauli on the phone. The police...'

'Yes, but you escaped from prison,' Olivia said quickly. 'You have a lot of friends. Perhaps Pauli can help you. Or...'

'Perhaps. I've got some good friends. I know that. But I've got a lot of enemies too,' Alex said slowly. 'Very dangerous enemies.'

Suddenly Olivia saw his hands. 'Your hands! Oh Alex, what happened to your hands?'

Alex looked down at them. 'It happened in prison,' he said slowly. 'They did it with a knife... and cigarettes.'

'But why?' Olivia whispered. 'Why did they do that?'

'They wanted a name, but I didn't tell them.'

'What name?'

'The name of the President's murderer.'

'But they say you killed him...' Olivia began.

'Yes, but I did not kill the President. And the police know that.'

'So they put you in prison,' Olivia said, 'because they needed a murderer.'

'Yes. And because of my book about the old President, and the government of this country. It was a very angry book. Do you remember?' Alex smiled. 'But the old President read it, and liked it. He wasn't a bad man, and he wanted a better life for the people. He wanted to change things in this country, but he couldn't. The police and the army stopped him. And the new President, of course, is a good friend of the police and the army. A very good friend.' Alex laughed angrily. 'You see, Olivia, the police know the murderer's name, but it's a secret. They don't want people in this country to know the name. And so they were angry with me in prison, because they think that I know the murderer's name.'

Olivia's face was afraid. 'Do... Do you know?' she whispered.

'Yes,' Alex looked at his wife's white, unhappy face. 'But I'm not going to tell you,' he said quietly. 'It's a very... dangerous name.'

Alex ate some food and changed his clothes. Then he slept, and Olivia watched the road through the windows.

*　*　*

In his office Felix waited for more news. He waited, and he thought—about his job, about the dead President and the new President, about the old woman Marta, about Eva Hine, the Chief of Police—and about Alex Dinon.

At 9.05 p. m. the telephone rang on Felix's desk. He listened, then quickly jumped to his feet and called to Adam. 'Dinon's in his home town,' he shouted. 'He's in his old teacher's house. He went in three minutes ago.'

Adam laughed. 'We've got him now,' he said happily.

'Listen,' Felix said quickly. 'Take ten more men with you and drive down to Dinon's town at once. Wait near the house and watch, but don't go in. I'm going to phone the Chief now, and then follow you.'

'Right,' Adam said, and quickly left the room.

Felix phoned the Chief and told her the news.

'Good ,' the Chief said. 'Now wait there. I want to speak to you again in ten minutes .'

Felix waited angrily. He wanted to leave at once. He wanted to talk to Alex Dinon. Perhaps Dinon knew the answers to Felix's questions. The phone rang and Felix picked it up quickly.

'Now listen, Inspector. Don't go into the house. Wait in the road and watch .'

'But we can go into the house and get him!' Felix said. 'Why not?'

'No, that's dangerous. Perhaps his wife and children are in the house .'

'But his children are with his wife's sister. We know that,' Felix said. 'So...'

'LISTEN TO ME, INSPECTOR ! '

Felix did not answer.

'Are you listening to me, Inspector ?'

'Yes, Chief,' Felix said quietly.

'Now, Dinon can't stay in the house. He's going to come out later in the night, when the streets are quiet. He can't escape. The soldiers —'

'Soldiers? What soldiers?' Felix said angrily. ' I don't need the army!'

'This man Dinon is very, very important, Inspector. You need help, and the army is going to help you. They're putting three hundred men in all the roads near the house. I want Dinon tonight, Inspector !'

The Chief put the phone down, and Felix stared at his desk. 'Alive... or dead?' he thought. 'Which does she—and our new President—want? I think I know the answer. They want him dead. And I want to know why!'

The police car took Felix to Dinon's home town, an hour away, and Felix found Adam in a quiet street behind the house. They sat in Adam's car and talked.

Adam looked at Felix's face. 'What are you angry about?' he asked. 'Dinon's in the house. And he can't escape now. When he comes out—Wham! We've got him!'

'I'm angry,' Felix said, 'because half the army with its guns is in this town tonight. I wanted to go into the house, but I can't because the Chief said "no", and the soldiers are watching the house. But I wanted to get to Dinon first.'

'That's going to be difficult,' Adam said. 'Soldiers shoot first, and ask questions later.'

'Yes,' Felix said slowly. 'They're going to kill Alex Dinon, and I can't stop them.'

第五天

在一条安静的路边的一所旧房子里，一个女人等待着。她望眼欲穿，夜不成寐。第五天晚上9点钟，她听到房子后面的窗户那儿有响动。

她很快跑过去把窗户打开了。一分钟后，她已经在亚历克斯的怀抱里了。他们沉默了很长时间。

然后，他们轻声地说起他们的朋友和家人。“孩子们和我妹妹在一起，”奥利维亚说，“他们在那儿会好一些。但是我到鲁迪家这儿来了。鲁迪不在，保利告诉我说，这是等你的最好的地方。在你离开这个国家之前，我想见你一面。噢，亚历克斯，我真为你担心。”

“是啊，逃亡将会很困难。”亚历克斯说，“我跟保利通过电话，警察……”

“是的，但你已经从监狱里逃出来了，”奥利维亚语速很快，“你有很多朋友，也许保利能帮你，或者……”

“也许吧，我有一些好朋友，这我知道。但是我也有很多敌人，”亚历克斯若有所思地说，“很危险的敌人。”

奥利维亚突然看着他的手。“你的手！噢，亚历克斯，你的手是怎么回事？”

亚历克斯低头看着自己的手。“在监狱里弄的。”他缓缓地说，“他们用刀子……还有烟头。”

“但是为什么？”奥利维亚小声问，“他们为什么要那样做？”

“他们想知道一个名字，但是我没告诉他们。”

“谁的名字？”

“谋杀总统的凶手的名字。”

“但他们说是你杀了他……”奥利维亚说。

“他们是这样说的，但是我没杀总统，而且这一点警察也知道。”

“所以他们把你 关进了监狱，”奥利维亚说，“因为他们需要一个凶手。”

“是的，这是因为我写了那本关于这个国家前任总统和政府的书。那是一本充满不满的书，你还记得吗？”亚历克斯笑了，“但是前总统读过它，而且很喜欢。他不是坏人，他想让人们过上好一点儿的生活。他想改变这个国家的某些事情。但是他没能办到，警方和军队阻止了他。而新总统，当然，是警方和军队的好朋友，他们的关系异常亲密。”亚历克斯愤怒地笑着，“你知道，奥利维亚，警方知道 凶手的名字，但这是个秘密。他们不想让这个国家的人知道这个名字。所以在监狱里，他们对我很粗暴，因为他们认为我 知道这个凶手的名字。”

奥利维亚一脸恐惧。“那你……你到底知不知道？”她轻声问道。

“知道。”他看着妻子那张苍白、忧郁的脸。“但是我不能告诉你，”他平静地说，“这是一个非常……危险的名字。”

亚历克斯吃了些东西，换了身衣服，然后睡了。奥利维亚透过窗户望着外面的路。

*　*　*

在办公室里，费利克斯正在等待着更多的消息。他等待着，思考着——关于他的工作，关于去世的总统和新总统，关于那个老太太玛尔塔，关于警长伊娃·海因——还有亚历克斯·迪农。

晚上9:05，费利克斯办公桌上的电话响了。他接听了电话，随后一下子站了起来，招呼亚当。“迪农现在就在他的家乡，”他喊道，“在他以前的老师家里。他三分钟前进了他老师的家门。”

亚当笑了。“我们现在终于找到他了。”他开心地说。

“听着，”费利克斯说得很快，“你再带上十个人立刻开车去迪农住的那个小镇，在房子周围等着，监视他，但是别进去。我给警长打电话汇报一下，随后就到。”

“好的。”亚当说着，很快地离开了。

费利克斯打电话给警长，向她报告这个消息。

“很好 ，”警长说，“你现在就在那儿等着。我十分钟后给你打电话 。”

费利克斯很生气，但也只好等着。他想马上离开，去和亚历克斯·迪农谈谈。也许迪农能够解答他的问题。电话铃响了，他立刻抓起听筒。

“听着，警员，不要进入那所房子，在路上等着，监视他。 ”

“但是我们可以进去抓住他！”费利克斯说，“为什么不呢？”

“不行，那样很危险。也许他的妻子和孩子也在房子里 。”

“我们已经查明，他的孩子在他的妻妹家里。”费利克斯说，“所以……”

“服从命令，警员 ！”

服从命令，警员

费利克斯没有回答。

“你在听我说话吗，警员 ？”

“是的，警长。”费利克斯平静地说。

“好，迪农不能一直待在那个房子里，晚上晚些时候，街上安静下来以后，他会出来的。他是跑不掉的。士兵们 ——”

“士兵？什么士兵？”费利克斯生气地说，“我不需要军队！”

“这个迪农非常非常重要，警员。你需要帮助，军队是去帮你的。他们在那所房子的周围布置了300个人，封锁了所有路口。我今天晚上就要抓住迪农，警员 ！”

警长挂断了电话。费利克斯盯着他的办公桌发愣。“活的……或者死的？”他想，“她——还有我们的新总统——到底要什么样的？我想我知道了。他们要他死，但是我想知道为什么！”

警车把费利克斯带到了迪农家所在的镇上。—个小时以后，费利克斯在房子后面的一条安静的街道上找到了亚当。他们坐在亚当的车里说话。

亚当看着费利克斯的脸。“你生什么气？”他问，“迪农在房子里。他现在跑不了啦。他一出来——啪！我们就抓住他啦！”

“我生气，”费利克斯说，“是因为今天晚上这个镇上来了无数当兵的，而且是荷枪实弹的。我想进到房子里去，却不能，因为警长说‘不行’。而且士兵们也在监视着这所房子。但是我想在他们之前抓住迪农。”

“那会很难。”亚当说，“士兵们总是先开枪，后问话。”

“是呀，”费利克斯慢慢地说，“他们会杀了迪农，而我却无法阻止。”

The Sixth Day

At three ο'clock in the morning Alex got up from the bed and looked out of the window. Olivia opened her eyes. 'Are you... Are you leaving now?' she asked.

'Yes,' Alex said. 'I can't stay longer. Perhaps the police are out there now. They're watching all our friends' houses. Pauli told me.' He put on his shoes and coat, then looked at his wife.

'Olivia. Listen. Be very careful and live very quietly. The police are going to watch you for some time. Wait for a year, then take the children and leave the country secretly. Our friends can help you. Find a new home in a new country and make a new life.'

Olivia began to cry. 'But Alex! You're going to be there with us.'

Alex smiled. 'Yes. Perhaps.' He took his wife's face in his hands and looked into her unhappy eyes. 'Don't cry, my love,' he said quietly. 'Give me a smile before I go.'

'Oh Alex! I'm afraid!' Olivia could not stop crying. 'I love you, I love you,' she whispered. 'Go quickly. And be careful. Please.'

Alex smiled sadly. 'Goodbye, my love.'

He left the house quickly and went out into the dark night. He waited for ten minutes at the door and listened, but he heard nothing and saw nothing. He came out into the road very carefully. Again he waited. From an upstairs window in his house, a white face watched him.

Then Alex began to walk quickly along the road. He stayed near the houses and looked behind him again and again. Two hundred metres along the road there was a car. Alex stared at it, but there was nobody in the car, and he walked quickly past.

Suddenly there were noises and lights—and soldiers with guns. Alex began to run, but he did not run far. There was a shot... two, three, four, five shots... And Alex did not move again.

*　*　*

Felix ran across the road and looked at the body. Adam was there before him.

'Is he alive?' Felix asked quickly.

'No, he's dead.' Adam stood up and looked at Felix. 'Very, very dead,' he said.

Felix's face was angry. 'The soldiers killed him,' he said.

Adam looked at Felix. 'Well, that's their job. Dinon ran away, so the soldiers shot him. "Alive or dead", the Chief said. But we found him. That's the important thing.'

Felix stared down at Alex Dinon's face. 'I wanted to talk to him... to ask him...'

'To ask him what?' Adam said.

Felix did not answer. He looked down at the dead body on the road, then he turned away.

'Nothing,' he said. 'It doesn't matter.'

There was a lot of noise in the road now. Soldiers and policemen moved here and there. Police cars came and went. The people in the houses looked out of their windows, but they did not open their doors. It was better not to ask questions. An ambulance came and took the body away.

Later that day Felix went back to the Chief's office. The Chief called him into her room.

'So he's dead,' she said. 'Well done, Felix. The President is very pleased with you.'

The Chief did not often say 'Felix'. Ususally she called him 'Inspector'.

Felix sat down and looked at Eva Hine. 'A lot of people think...' He stopped. Then he began again. 'They say... Alex Dinon wasn't the President's murderer.'

'People say a lot of things,' the Chief said. She smiled. 'But they're not all true. Don't listen to stories, Felix. You've got a good job. Don't ask questions.'

'But perhaps,' Felix said slowly, 'the stories are true. And it's a policeman's job to ask questions.'

Eva Hine stood up and came nearer to Felix. She looked down into his face, and her grey eyes were cold.

'Listen,' she said. 'Somebody murdered the old President. Right? And our new President needed a murderer. Quickly. So we found a murderer for him. Alex Dinon. We don't kill murderers in this country. They go to prison. But Dinon escaped from prison—and now he's dead. The murderer is dead, Felix, and that's the end of the story.'

It was very quiet in the room. The Chief watched Felix and waited. Felix looked down at his hands and said nothing. Then he looked up into Eva Hine's cold eyes.

'Who murdered the President?' he asked.

Eva Hine's face did not change. She stared at Felix, and Felix stared back at her.

After a long time Eva Hine said, 'Perhaps you need a new job, Felix. Think about it... very carefully.'

The young man looked at her face, then he looked away, out of the window. After a minute or two he stood up, and went to the door. Then he turned and looked at the Chief of Police.

'I'd like to know the murderer's name,' he said quietly. 'And I'm going to find it.' He opened the door. 'Goodbye, Chief.'

He went out and closed the door behind him, for the last time.

第六天

凌晨3点，亚历克斯从床上坐了起来，向窗外看去。奥利维亚睁开眼睛。“你要……你要走了吗？”她问。

“是的。”亚历克斯说，“我不能再待在这儿了。也许现在警察就在外面，他们监视了我们所有朋友的房子。保利告诉我的。”他穿上鞋和外套，而后看着他的妻子。

“奥利维亚，听着，小心谨慎点儿，平平静静地过日子。警察会监视你一段时间。等上一年，然后带着孩子，悄悄地离开这个国家。我们的朋友会帮助你的。在一个新的国度，安一个新家，开始新的生活。”

奥利维亚开始哭了。“但是亚历克斯！你可要去那儿和我们会合。”

亚历克斯笑了。“好的，也许吧。”他手捧妻子的脸，看着她那忧伤的眼睛。“别哭，亲爱的。”他平静地说，“在我走之前，为我笑一下。”

“噢，亚历克斯！我好害怕！”奥利维亚一直哭着。“我爱你，我爱你。”她轻轻地说，“快走吧，一定要小心点儿，求你了。”

亚历克斯笑了，但是笑得很悲伤。“再见，亲爱的。”

他很快地出去了，走进了漆黑的夜色之中。他在门口等了十分钟，听了听，但是一点儿动静也没有，也没看到什么。他小心翼翼地来到了路上。然后又等了一会儿。在他家的那所房子楼上的一个窗口里，一张苍白的脸正注视着他。

接着亚历克斯开始沿着马路飞快地走起来。在有房子的地方，他不时地停下来，回头看了又看。沿路200米处有辆汽车，亚历克斯定神看了看，车里没人。他很快走过去了。

突然，响起了一片噪音，灯也亮了——还有荷枪实弹的士兵。亚历克斯开始跑，但是没能跑多远。枪响了……两声，三声，四声，五声……然后亚历克斯就倒下不动了。

*　*　*

费利克斯跑过马路，看着倒下的躯体。亚当比他先到了那儿。

“他还活着吗？”费利克斯急切地问。

“不，已经死了。”亚当站起来，看着费利克斯。“彻底没救了。”他说。

费利克斯满面怒色。“那些士兵杀了他。”他说。

亚当看着费利克斯。“好啦，那是他们的职责。迪农逃跑，所以士兵们便开枪打死了他。警长说‘不管活的还是死的’。但是我们找到了他，这才是重要的。”

费利克斯低头盯着亚历克斯的脸，“我想和他谈谈……问问他……”

“问他什么？”亚当问。

费利克斯没有回答，又低头看着路上的尸体，然后转过身去。

“没什么，”他说，“无关紧要。”

现在路上一团嘈杂，士兵和警察走来走去的。警车来了，又走了。人们在房子里透过窗户向外望，但是没有开门。不问问题才是上策。一辆救护车来了，拉走了尸体。

那天晚些时候，费利克斯回到警长的办公室。警长把他叫到她的房间。

“他死了，”她说，“干得不错，费利克斯。总统对你很满意。”

警长并不常称呼他“费利克斯”，她通常称他为“警员”。

费利克斯坐下，看着伊娃·海因。“许多人认为……”他停了一下，而后又接着说，“他们说……亚历克斯·迪农不是杀害总统的凶手。”

“人们说什么的都有，”警长说，她笑了，“但他们说的并不都是真的。不要去听信那些传言，费利克斯。你有一份不错的工作，但别问问题。”

“但是也许，”费利克斯慢吞吞地说，“那些传言是真的，而一个警察的天职就是问问题。”

伊娃·海因站起来，走近费利克斯。她低头看着他的脸，灰色的眼睛异常冷峻。

“听着，”她说，“有人谋杀了前总统，是吧？而我们的新总统需要找到一个谋杀犯，非常急切。所以我们就给他找一个谋杀犯，就是亚历克斯·迪农。在我们国家，我们不能处死谋杀犯，而是把他们关进监狱。但是迪农从监狱里逃跑了——而现在他死了。谋杀犯死了，费利克斯，这就是故事的结局。”

房间里鸦雀无声。警长看着费利克斯，等待着。费利克斯低头看着自己的双手，一言不发。然后他抬起头，看着伊娃·海因那双冷峻的眼睛。

“那么是谁谋杀了总统？”他问。

伊娃·海因的脸僵住了。她瞪着费利克斯，费利克斯也瞪着她。

过了好长时间，伊娃·海因说：“也许你需要一份新的工作，费利克斯。考虑考虑吧……好好考虑考虑。”

年轻人看着她的脸，然后把目光移开，望着窗外。一两分钟以后，他站了起来，向门口走去。然后又转过身看着警长。

“我想知道谋杀犯的名字，”他平静地说，“我会查出来的。”他打开门，“再见，警长。”

说着他走了出去，并且最后一次关上了那扇门。

内容简介

是不是所有的自行车轮胎都一样？有多少种不同的自行车轮胎？当有人骑过松软潮湿的地面，轮胎会在地面上留下车辙——但是有一只轮胎会留下更深的车辙。这是前轮的轮胎还是后轮的轮胎？

当公爵的儿子被从赫克斯特伯博士的学校绑架的时候，了解这些问题的答案意义重大。歇洛克·福尔摩斯和他的老朋友华生大夫花了数小时查看低峡谷沼泽里的泥土。他们发现了自行车轮胎的车辙、羊和牛的蹄印——他们还发现了一具尸体。现在有了更多的问题，而且华生大夫认为不可能找到答案。“得啦，得啦，华生，”福尔摩斯说，“每个秘密都有它的答案。”

但是甚至连歇洛克·福尔摩斯对这起神秘事件的答案也大感意外……

SHERLOCK HOLMESAND THE DUKE'S SON

AND THE DUKE'S SON

Are all bicycle tyres the same? How many different kinds of bicycle tyre are there? When someone cycles over soft wet ground, the tyres leave tracks on the ground—but one tyre makes a deeper track. Is it the tyre on the front wheel or the back wheel?

When the Duke's son is kidnapped from Dr Huxtable's school, it is important to know the answers to questions like these. Sherlock Holmes, and his old friend Dr Watson, spend many hours looking at the mud on Lower Gill Moor. They find the tracks of bicycle tyres, the tracks of sheep and of cows—and they also find a body. Now there are even more questions, and Dr Watson thinks it is not possible to find the answers. 'Come, come, Watson,' says Holmes. 'Every mystery has an answer.'

But even Sherlock Holmes is surprised by the answer to this mystery...

1Sherlock Holmes has a visitor

Sherlock Holmes has a visitor

When visitors came to see Sherlock Holmes in Baker Street, they often did surprising things. Sometimes they put their heads in their hands and cried. Sometimes they talked and talked, and couldn't stop. And sometimes they just sat there and didn't say a word. But nobody was more surprising than Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable.

He was a large man, tall, well-dressed, and important-looking. He came into the room, walked to one of the big chairs, and suddenly fell into it. He sat there, with his eyes closed, looking white and ill.

I ran to get some water for him. Then I got my doctor's bag, and looked at him carefully.

'What is it, Watson? ' said Holmes.

'He's all right, I think,' I said. 'He's just very, very tired—and probably hungry too.'

Holmes looked in the man's pockets—and found a train ticket from Mackleton, in the north of England.

'Mackleton—that's a long way,' said Holmes. 'It's not twelve o'clock yet, so he probably left home before five o'clock this morning.'

After a minute or two the man began to move, and his eyes opened. A second later he got quickly to his feet. His face was now red and unhappy.

'Mr Holmes, I am so sorry! I forgot to eat or drink anything this morning—that's why I felt ill.'

'When you feel better—' I began.

'I'm better now, thank you,' said our visitor. 'And I want very much to talk to Mr Holmes—to ask him something. Please, Mr Holmes, come back to Mackleton with me by the next train.'

'I'm sorry, that's not possible,' said Holmes. 'I'm working on two important cases—the Ferrers case and the Abergavenny case. I cannot leave London at the moment.'

'Important cases!' our visitor cried. 'But this case is very important too. You know about the kidnapping of the son of the Duke of Holdernesse three days ago...'

'What! The Government Minister?'

'Yes, that's him. So you didn't know... It's not in the newspapers yet, that's true. But Sherlock Holmes always hears news before other people, I thought.'

Holmes went to get one of his books, and began to read the page about the Duke of Holdernesse.

'Holdernesse, sixth Duke. Wife: Edith, daughter of Lord Grey. One child, Lord Arthur Saltire. Houses in London, Lancashire, and Wales. Government Minister for this...for that...for the other... Well, well,' said Holmes. 'He's one of the greatest men in the country.'

'One of the greatest, and one of the richest,' said Dr Huxtable. 'I know, Mr Holmes, that you don't work for money, but I must tell you this. The Duke is offering five thousand pounds for news of his son, and another one thousand pounds for the name of his kidnapper.'

'That,' said Holmes, 'is a most interesting offer.' He looked at me. 'Watson, I think we are going with Dr Huxtable back to the north of England this afternoon.'

Holmes then looked at Dr Huxtable. 'Now, sir, tell me everything. What happened? When did it happen? How did it happen? And why does Dr Thorneycroft Huxtable come to ask for my help three days later?'

Our visitor drank some water, and began his story.

1 ．有客人拜访歇洛克·福尔摩斯

当客人们来到贝克大街找歇洛克·福尔摩斯的时候，他们的举止经常是怪异的。他们有时抱着头痛哭，有时滔滔不绝地说个不停，有时只是一言不发地坐着。但是没有人比桑尼克罗夫特·赫克斯特伯博士的举止更怪异了。

他又高又胖，衣着考究，气宇轩昂。他走进房间，朝其中一把大椅子走去，突然瘫倒在椅子里。他坐在那里，双目紧闭，脸色苍白，像生病了一样。

我连忙跑去为他倒水。然后我拿来医药包，仔细地给他作检查。

“怎么回事，华生？”福尔摩斯说。

“我觉得他没事，”我说，“他只是非常非常疲劳——而且也可能是饿了。”

福尔摩斯检查了那男人的口袋——发现了一张从英国北部城市麦克尔顿出发的火车票。

“麦克尔顿——那个地方很远，”福尔摩斯说，“现在还不到12点，所以他可能是在今天凌晨5点之前离开家的。”

过了一两分钟，这个男人动了动，并且睁开了眼睛。一秒钟之后他迅速地站了起来。此刻，他的脸色变红了，露出一丝悲伤的神情。

“福尔摩斯先生，非常抱歉！今天早上我忘记吃点儿或喝点儿什么了——所以我感到不舒服。”

“等你感觉好些的时候——”我说。

“现在我好多了，谢谢，”这位来访者说，“我非常想和福尔摩斯先生谈谈——想问他一些事情。求你了，福尔摩斯先生，跟我坐下一趟火车回麦克尔顿。”

“对不起，那不可能，”福尔摩斯说，“我正在处理两桩重大的案件——费勒案和阿伯加文尼案，这个时候我不能离开伦敦。”

“重大案件！”我们的客人喊道，“但是这个案子也很重大。要知道三天前霍尔德内斯公爵的儿子被绑架了……”

“什么！那个内阁部长吗？”

“是的，就是他。这么说你不知道……到目前为止报纸上确实还没刊登此消息。但是我以为歇洛克·福尔摩斯总是比别人消息灵通的。”

福尔摩斯走过去从他的一堆书里拿出了一本，开始读介绍霍尔德内斯公爵的那一页。

“霍尔德内斯，第六世公爵。夫人：伊迪丝，格雷勋爵的女儿。有一个独生子，阿瑟·索尔特勋爵。在伦敦、兰开夏和威尔士都有房产。负责这个……，那个……等等……的内阁部长，啊，啊，”福尔摩斯说，“他是这个国家地位最显赫的人物之一。”

“最显赫，也是最富有的人之一，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“福尔摩斯先生，我知道你并不是为了钱工作，但是我必须告诉你这一点。公爵开价5,000英镑，奖励提供他儿子的消息的人，开价1,000英镑，奖励提供绑架者名字的人。”

“那个，”福尔摩斯说，“是非常吸引人的开价。”他看着我，“华生，我想今天下午我们要和赫克斯特伯博士一起回英国的北部去。”

然后，福尔摩斯看着赫克斯特伯博士。“先生，现在告诉我一切。发生了什么事？什么时候发生的？怎么发生的？为什么桑尼克罗夫特·赫克斯特伯博士三天之后 才来寻求我的帮助？”

我们的客人喝了几口水，开始述说他的故事。

2Dr Huxtable's story

Dr Huxtable's story

'My school—the Priory School near Mackleton—is the best school for young boys in England,' began Dr Huxtable. 'We have the sons of Lord Soames, Lord Lever, and of many other important people. Three weeks ago Mr James Wilder, the Duke of Holdernesse's secretary, came to see me. The Duke, he said, wanted to send his son, the ten-year-old Lord Saltire, to my school.

'On the 1st of May young Lord Saltire arrived. He's a nice boy, and he soon began to like school life and to make friends. His life at home, you see, was not very happy—we all know about the Duke and his wife. The Duchess, of course, now lives in the south of France. She left the Duke about three months ago, I think. But the boy loved his mother, and was very unhappy when she left. Because of this, the Duke sent him to my school. And after two weeks with us, he was much happier.

'Then, on the night of the 13th of May, he disappeared. The way to his bedroom is through another, larger room. Two older boys sleep there. One of them never sleeps very well, and he heard and saw nothing that night. So young Arthur did not go out through that room. His window was open, and there is ivy all up the wall of the house. It is easy to get out of the window and down the ivy to the ground. So we think that he went out that way.

'He was in his usual school things, we think—a short black coat and dark blue trousers. We looked all through his room very carefully, but we found nothing strange, nothing unusual.

'When I learnt the news at seven o'clock on Tuesday morning, I called everybody into the big schoolroom. Then we learnt more bad news—Heidegger, the German teacher, was missing too. His room is not far from Arthur's room. Heidegger went down the ivy—we know this because we found his footprints on the ground under the window. We know, too, that he was only in his coat, trousers, and shoes, because we found his shirt and his socks on the floor of his room. And he took his bicycle with him.

'Heidegger came to the school a year ago. He's a good teacher, but the boys don't like him because he isn't very friendly.

'So, Mr Holmes, we have two missing people. It's now Thursday, and there's still no news of them.'

Holmes took out a little notebook, and began to write things down.

'The boy didn't go home, of course,' he said.

'No, no. We asked at Holdernesse Hall at once,' said Dr Huxtable. 'The Duke is very afraid for his son—and I am the unhappiest man in England. Mr Holmes, you are a famous detective—please help me!'

'You make things very difficult for me,' Holmes said. 'How can I find marks in the ivy or on the ground after three days? Why didn't you come to me at once?'

'Because of the Duke,' Dr Huxtable said. 'He doesn't like people talking about his unhappy family life.'

'And what are the police doing?'

'Well, they heard about a boy and a young man at the station early on Tuesday. They looked for them, and last night they found them in Liverpool—but it was a man and his son going to visit a friend. We lost three days because of that. And last night I couldn't sleep, so I took the first train down to London this morning.'

'Well, Dr Huxtable, some more questions,' said Holmes. 'Did the boy take German lessons?'

'No.'

'So he didn't know the German teacher well, then.'

'He probably never spoke to him,' said Dr Huxtable.

'Mmm,' said Holmes. 'Does the boy have a bicycle?'

'No.'

'Was any other bicycle missing?'

'No.'

'So. Did the German teacher ride away on his bicycle in the night, with the boy on his back? I don't think so. But what happened to the bicycle? Now, what about visitors? Did the boy have any visitors the day before?'

'No.'

'Did he get any letters?'

'Yes, one letter. From his father.'

'Do you open the boys' letters, Dr Huxtable?'

'No.'

'Then how do you know that the letter was from the father?'

'I know the Duke's handwriting. And he says that he wrote a letter to his son.'

'Did the boy get any letters from France?'

'No, I never saw any.'

'Do you understand me, Dr Huxtable?' Holmes said. 'Did someone take the boy away, or did the boy go freely? —because he had a letter from France perhaps.'

'I don't know,' said Dr Huxtable. 'He only had letters from his father, I think.'

'Were father and son very friendly?'

'The Duke is not... er... not a very friendly man, Mr Holmes. He's not a bad father, but he is a Government Minister and has a lot of things to do.'

'So the boy felt more friendly to his mother?'

'Yes.'

'Did he say that?'

'No.'

'Did the Duke tell you, then?'

'Oh no ! The Duke never talks about things like that.'

'So how do you know?'

'Mr James Wilder, the Duke's secretary, told me.'

'I see,' said Holmes. 'That last letter of the Duke's—where is it now?'

'The boy took it with him,' Dr Huxtable said. 'It's not in his room. Mr Holmes—our train leaves in half an hour.'

'Right,' said Holmes. He looked at me. 'Watson, let's get ready and go off to the north with Dr Huxtable. Perhaps we can find some answers to this mystery.'

2 ．赫克斯特伯博士的故事

“我的学校——麦克尔顿附近的修道院公学——是英国最好的一所男童学校，”赫克斯特伯博士开始说道，“在学校里就读的有索姆斯勋爵、利弗勋爵，以及其他一些重要人物的儿子。三个星期前，霍尔德内斯公爵的秘书詹姆斯·怀尔德先生来见我。他说公爵想送他10岁的儿子索尔特勋爵来我的学校上学。

“5月1日小索尔特勋爵到了。他是个好孩子，而且不久之后就开始喜欢学校生活，并开始交朋友了。你知道，他的家庭生活并不怎么幸福——我们大家对公爵和他夫人的事都有耳闻。当然，公爵夫人现在住在法国南部。我想，她大概是3个月前离开公爵的。但是这个孩子爱他的母亲，她走之后他非常不高兴。因为这个，公爵送他来我的学校。和我们相处了两个星期后，他快活多了。

“然后，在5月13日的晚上，他失踪了。去他的卧室要经过另外一个大一些的房间。两个年龄稍大的孩子睡在那里。其中一个孩子睡觉一向不踏实，那天晚上他没有听到或看到什么，所以说小阿瑟没有经过那个房间出来。他房间的窗户开着，屋外的墙上爬满了常青藤，人很容易就能从那个窗户爬出来，并顺着常青藤下来。因此我们认为他是这么出去的。”

“他穿戴着学校平日的衣物，我们想是——黑色的短外衣和深蓝色的裤子。我们仔细查看了他的房间，但是没有发现一丝异样或不寻常。

“我星期二早上7点听到这个消息时，把所有人都叫到了大教室。然后我们听到了更多的坏消息——德语老师海德格也失踪了。他的房间离阿瑟的不远。海德格是顺着常青藤爬下去的——我们之所以知道这一点是因为我们在窗户下面的地上发现了他的脚印。我们还知道他只穿着外衣、裤子和鞋，因为我们在他房间的地板上发现了他的衬衫和袜子。而且他是骑自行车走的。

“海德格是一年前来到我的学校的。他是个好老师，但是因为他不太和善，孩子们都不喜欢他。

“所以，福尔摩斯先生，我们有两个人失踪了。现在是星期四了，依然没有他们的消息。”

福尔摩斯拿出一个小笔记本，开始在上面记着什么。

“那男孩儿当然没有回家。”他说。

“不，没有。我们当时马上询问了霍尔德内斯府上，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“公爵很为自己的儿子担心——而我是英国最不幸的人了。福尔摩斯先生，你是一个著名的侦探——请帮帮我！”

“你让事情变得对我来说很棘手，”福尔摩斯说，“事情发生三天了，我怎么能够在常青藤和地上发现痕迹呢？你当时为什么不立刻来找我呢？”

“是因为公爵，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“他不喜欢别人谈论他不幸的家庭生活。”

“警察现在在做什么？”

“唉，他们星期二一早听说车站有一个小孩儿和一个年轻人。他们就去寻找这两个人，昨天晚上在利物浦找到了——但他们是一对去看望朋友的父子。为此我们浪费了三天时间。昨天晚上我无法入眠，于是我乘坐今天早上的第一趟火车赶到伦敦。”

“那么，赫克斯特伯博士，再问你几个问题，”福尔摩斯说，“那个男孩儿选修德语课了吗？”

“没有。”

“这么说，他和那个德语老师不怎么熟悉了。”

“他可能从来都没有跟他说过话。”赫克斯特伯博士说。

“嗯，”福尔摩斯说，“那男孩儿有自行车吗？”

“没有。”

“还有其他的自行车丢失吗？”

“没有。”

“嗯。是德语老师那天晚上骑自行车离开，后面带着那个男孩儿吗？我不这么认为。但是那辆自行车怎么了？那么，有客人来访过没有？事发之前有谁来看过那个男孩儿吗？”

“没有。”

“他收到过什么信件没有？”

“是的，有一封。是他父亲写来的。”

“你拆看孩子们的信吗，赫克斯特伯博士？”

“不。”

“那么你怎么知道那封信是他父亲写来的？”

“我认识公爵的笔迹，而且他说他给儿子写了一封信。”

“那男孩儿收到过从法国来的信吗？”

“没有，我从来没有见过。”

“你明白我的意思吗，赫克斯特伯博士？”福尔摩斯说，“是有人把男孩儿带走了，还是男孩儿自己走的？——因为他有可能收到过来自法国的信。”

“我不知道，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“我想他只收到过他父亲的来信。”

“他们父子俩的关系融洽吗？”

“公爵不是……呃……不是一个和善的人，福尔摩斯先生。他是个不错的父亲，但他是内阁部长，有许多事情要做。”

“这么说男孩儿和他母亲的关系更为融洽了？”

“是的。”

“他自己那么说的吗？”

“没有。”

“那么是公爵告诉你的？”

“哦，不！公爵从来不说这种事。”

“那你是怎么知道的？”

“是公爵的秘书詹姆斯·怀尔德先生告诉我的。”

“我明白了，”福尔摩斯说，“公爵的最后一封信——现在在哪里？”

“被那男孩儿带走了，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“信不在他的房间里。福尔摩斯先生——半小时后我们那趟火车就要开了。”

“好的，”福尔摩斯说。他看着我，“华生，我们准备一下，跟赫克斯特伯博士到北部去。也许我们能给这个神秘事件找到一些答案。”

3Holmes and Watson go north

Holmes and Watson go north

It was dark when we arrived at Dr Huxtable's famous school in the northern hills. We went quickly into the building out of the cold, and at once someone ran up with news for Dr Huxtable.

He looked very surprised. 'The Duke is here,' he told us. 'The Duke and Mr Wilder, his secretary, are in my office. Come and meet them.'

The Government Minister was a tall man with a long, thin face. He had red hair, and a great red beard. He looked at us, and did not smile. Next to him stood Mr Wilder, a very young man. He was small, with blue eyes, and a watchful face. He spoke first.

'The Duke is surprised, Dr Huxtable, to see Mr Sherlock Holmes here. He doesn't want people to know about this. You know that, so why didn't you speak to the Duke before you went to London?'

'But we need help,' said Dr Huxtable. 'And I—'

'Well,' said the Duke. 'Mr Holmes is here now, and perhaps he can help us.' He looked at Holmes. 'I'd like you to come and stay at Holdernesse Hall, Mr Holmes.'

'Thank you, sir,' said Holmes. 'But I would like to stay near to the mystery, here at the school. Can I ask you one or two questions, perhaps?'

'Of course,' said the Duke.

'My questions are about the Duchess, and about money,' said Holmes.

'The Duchess knows nothing about this,' said the Duke, 'and nobody is asking me for money.'

'I see,' said Holmes. 'You wrote a letter to your son before he disappeared. When did you post it?'

'Post it?' said Mr Wilder angrily. 'The Duke does not post letters. I put the letter into the postbag, with all the other letters that day.'

A minute or two later the Duke and Mr Wilder left. Holmes then began at once to work on the case. We looked carefully all through the boy's bedroom, and the German teacher's room. We looked at the ivy on the wall, and we saw the footprints under the German teacher's window. But we learnt nothing new. Holmes then left the house, and only came back after eleven o'clock.

He had with him a large map. He brought it into my room and put it on the bed.

'This case is beginning to get interesting, Watson,' he said. 'Look at this map. Here is the school, you see, and here is the road. So, did the boy and the teacher go along the road when they left? No, Watson, they did not!'

'How do you know that, Holmes?' I asked.

'Because there was a policeman here—look. He was there from midnight to six in the morning, and he saw nobody on the road. I spoke to him this evening. And here at the other end, you see, is the White Horse Inn. A woman there was ill, and the family watched the road all night, waiting for the doctor. The doctor didn't come until the morning, and the family saw nobody on the road. So the boy and the teacher did not go by road.'

'But, Holmes, what about the bicycle?' I asked.

'Yes, Watson, we must remember the bicycle, of course. But first, let's look to the south and the north. To the south we have a big river—no bicycles there, then. And to the north we have the trees, called Ragged Shaw, and then a great moor, the Lower Gill Moor. And here is Holdernesse Hall, sixteen kilometres from the school by road, but only nine kilometres across the moor. No other houses, until the Green Man Inn, along the Chesterfield road.'

'But the bicycle?' I said again.

'Yes, yes, Watson!' Holmes said. 'It is possible to ride a bicycle across the moor—difficult, but possible.'

Just then Dr Huxtable came quickly into the room. 'News, Mr Holmes!' he said excitedly. 'I bring news!' In his hands was a blue school hat. 'Look—this is the boy's hat. One of my gardeners found it this evening.'

'Where, man, where?' asked Holmes.

'Just north of Ragged Shaw,' said Dr Huxtable.

'Aha!' said Holmes. 'What did I tell you, Watson? Tomorrow we must walk north, across the moor.'

3 ．福尔摩斯和华生北上

当我们到达赫克斯特伯博士位于北部山区的著名学校时，天已经黑了。我们快步进入大楼避寒，有人立刻跑过来告诉赫克斯特伯博士一则消息。

他看起来非常惊讶。“公爵在这里，”他告诉我们说，“公爵和他的秘书怀尔德先生在我的办公室。去见见他们吧。”

内阁部长是一个高个子男人，长着一张瘦长的脸。他留着一头红头发，引人注目的胡须也是红色的。他看着我们，没有一丝笑容。年轻的怀尔德先生站在他身边。怀尔德身材瘦小，长着一双蓝眼睛，脸上带着警戒的神色。他首先开口说话。

“赫克斯特伯博士，在这里见到歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，公爵感到很意外。他不想让任何人知道这件事，你是知道这一点的，那么你去伦敦之前为什么不跟公爵说一声？”

“但是我们需要帮助，”赫克斯特伯博士说，“而且我——”

“嗯，”公爵说，“既然现在福尔摩斯先生来了，他也许能帮我们。”他看着福尔摩斯，“我希望你去住在霍尔德内斯府，福尔摩斯先生。”

“谢谢，先生，”福尔摩斯说，“但是我喜欢住在离谜案更近的地方，就在这所学校。或许我能向您提一两个问题，可以吗？”

“当然可以。”公爵说。

“我的问题是有关公爵夫人和钱的。”福尔摩斯说。

“公爵夫人对此事一无所知，”公爵说，“也没有人向我勒索钱财。”

“我明白，”福尔摩斯说，“在您儿子失踪之前您给他写过一封信。您是什么时候把信寄出去的？”

“寄信？”怀尔德先生生气地说，“公爵从不寄信。是我 把信放进邮袋的，和当天其他的信件一起放进去的。”

过了一两分钟之后公爵和怀尔德先生便告辞了。福尔摩斯立即开始着手处理这个案子。我们仔细检查了孩子的卧室和德语老师的房间，还查看了墙上的常青藤和德语老师窗户下的脚印，但是没有发现新线索。然后福尔摩斯离开了房间，11点之后才回来。

他带回来一张大地图。他把地图带到我的房间，铺在床上。

“这个案子开始变得有趣了，华生，”他说，“看看这张地图。这里是学校，你看，这里是路。那么，那男孩儿和老师离开的时候是沿着路走的吗？不，华生，他们没有！”

“你是怎么知道的，福尔摩斯？”我问道。

“因为这里有个警察——看。从午夜到早上6点他一直在那里，他没看到路上有人。今天晚上我跟他谈过了。这里，在另外一端，你看，是白马旅店。那里有一个女人病了，这家人整夜守望着这条路，等待医生的到来。医生早晨才来，这家人没看到路上有人经过。因此，那男孩儿和老师没有 从路上走。”

“但是，福尔摩斯，那自行车呢？”我问。

“是的，华生，我们当然必须记着那辆自行车。但是首先，让我们先往南看再往北看。南面有一条大河——那里没有自行车。往北都是树，叫杂木林，接着是一大片沼泽，叫低峡谷沼泽。这里是霍尔德内斯府，从学校沿着大路过去有16公里，但是从沼泽地穿过去只有9公里。中途没有别的房子，只有切斯特菲尔德路边的林中人客栈。”

“但是那辆自行车呢？”我又说。

“是的，是的，华生！”福尔摩斯说，“骑自行车穿过沼泽地是很有可能的——很难，但是有这种可能性。”

就在这个时候，赫克斯特伯博士匆匆进来了。“福尔摩斯先生，有消息！”他激动地说，“我带来了消息！”他的手里拿着一顶蓝色的校帽，“看——这是那男孩儿的帽子。我的一个园丁今天晚上发现的。”

“在哪里，嗨，在哪里？”福尔摩斯问。

“就在杂木林北面。”赫克斯特伯说。

“啊哈！”福尔摩斯说，“我刚才跟你说什么来着，华生？明天我们必须往北面走，穿过沼泽地。”

4The body on the moor

The body on the moor

Very early the next morning I opened my eyes, and saw Holmes next to my bed. He was already dressed.

'Come, Watson,' he cried. 'There is hot coffee ready for you. We leave in ten minutes.'

By six o'clock we were through Ragged Shaw, and half an hour later we were on Lower Gill Moor. Across the middle of the moor was a small river, and the ground all around it was very wet.

'We can easily see tracks in this wet ground,' said Holmes. 'Look carefully, Watson!'

We moved slowly across the moor, looking at every centimetre of mud. We found hundreds of sheep tracks, and once some cow tracks—but no bicycle tracks. And then at last, we found something. Not far from the little river, right across some nice black mud, was the track of a bicycle.

'Hurrah!' I cried. 'We have it.'

But Holmes did not look happy. 'It's a bicycle, yes, but not the bicycle. Every bicycle has different tyres—I know forty-two different kinds of tyre. This tyre is a Dunlop, but Heidegger's bicycle had Palmer tyres. The English teacher told me that. So this is not Heidegger.'

'Is it the boy, then?' I asked.

'Probably not. The boy didn't take a bicycle with him,' said Holmes. He looked again at the track in the mud. 'This track is going away from the school.'

'Or perhaps to the school?' I said.

'No, no, my dear Watson. Look at the tracks of the two tyres. Are they the same?'

'Er, no,' I said. 'One tyre makes a deeper track.'

'And that's the back wheel,' said Holmes, 'because the rider, of course, sits over the back wheel. The deeper track is the one on top, so this bicycle went that way, across the moor away from the school. But who was the rider? Where did he come from?'

We followed the Dunlop track back, nearly to Ragged Shaw. Then we lost it, in some cow tracks. Holmes sat down and thought for some minutes.

'No,' he said, getting up. 'We must leave this question for now. Back to the mud by the river, Watson!'

Two hours later Holmes gave a happy cry. I quickly ran over to him, and looked down at a long thin track in the mud. It was the Palmer tyre.

' Here is Heidegger!' cried Holmes. 'Let's follow him, Watson.'

For a kilometre or more we followed the Palmer tyre north across the moor, losing the track, finding it again, losing it, and finding it. Suddenly, the track stopped.

'What happened here?' I said. 'Did he fall?'

Holmes looked carefully on the ground. Then he moved to some small bushes with yellow flowers on them. 'Look,' he said quietly.

On one of the yellow flowers there was something red—the dark, browny-red of blood.

'Bad!' said Holmes. 'Bad! What do I read here? Something or someone hit him. He fell, he stood up, he got onto his bicycle again, and rode away. But there is no other track. Some cow tracks here, but no footprints. We must follow the blood, Watson.'

We soon found the bicycle, and then behind a bush we saw a shoe, and found a body. There was blood on the man's head and face, and he was very, very dead. He had shoes on, but no socks, and we saw a night-shirt under his open coat. It was the German teacher.

'Poor man,' Holmes said quietly. 'What shall we do, Watson? We can't lose any more time, but we must tell someone about this poor man.'

'Shall I run back to the school?' I said.

'No, I need you with me.' Holmes stood up and looked around. 'Look!' he said. 'There's a workman over there. He can go back to the school for us.'

I went and got the workman, and Holmes wrote a note for Dr Huxtable. The poor workman took one look at the body, and began to run quickly down the hill to Ragged Shaw.

'Now,' said Holmes, 'before we go on, let's think carefully for a minute. What do we know so far? First, the boy left freely. He was dressed, he did not leave suddenly, he wanted to go—perhaps with someone, perhaps not. But the German teacher left without his socks and without his shirt, so he left very suddenly.'

'That's right,' I said.

'And why did Heidegger go? Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the boy. Because he wanted to follow him and bring him back. So far, so good. But why doesn't Heidegger just run after the boy? A man can easily run faster than a boy—but Heidegger doesn't do this. He gets his bicycle. He knows that he needs his bicycle. Why?'

'Ah,' I said, 'because the boy has a bicycle.'

'Not so fast, Watson. Think about it. Heidegger dies eight kilometres from the school. So the boy is moving very fast, because it is eight kilometres before a man on a bicycle can get near him. And Heidegger dies because someone hits him very hard on the head. A boy can't do that, so there was someone with the boy —a man, let's say. But we looked very carefully at the mud all round poor Heidegger's body, Watson, and what did we find? Some cow tracks, but nothing more. No footprints from people, no bicycle tracks.'

'Holmes,' I cried. 'This is not possible.'

'Very good, Watson,' he said. 'It's not possible, so something is wrong with my thinking. What can it be?'

'Perhaps,' I said, 'Heidegger broke his head in a fall?'

'In mud, Watson?'

'Oh, I don't know, I just don't know.'

'Come, come, Watson,' said Holmes. 'Every mystery has an answer. But for now, the Palmer tyre can tell us nothing more, so we must go back to the Dunlop tyre.'

We found the Dunlop track again and followed it north. Here there was very little mud, and we lost the track. Across the moor we could now see Holdernesse Hall, some kilometres to our left, and in front of us we could see the Chesterfield road. We walked down to the road, and along to the Green Man Inn.

4 ．沼泽地里的尸体

第二天一大早，我睁开眼睛，看到福尔摩斯站在我的床边。他已经穿戴整齐了。

“来，华生，”他叫道，“给你准备了热咖啡。10分钟后我们出发。”

6点钟时我们穿过了杂木林，半个小时后我们到了低峡谷沼泽。沼泽地的中间有一条小河，河畔的地面非常湿。

“我们能很容易地看到这湿地上的痕迹，”福尔摩斯说，“仔细看，华生！”

我们慢慢地穿过沼泽地，查看了每一寸泥土。我们发现了许多绵羊的蹄印，还有一些牛的蹄印——但是没有自行车的车辙。最后，我们发现了些什么。离小河不远的地方有自行车的车辙，恰好穿过一些肥沃的黑±。

“好啊！”我叫起来，“我们找到了。”

但是福尔摩斯没有显出高兴的样子。“这是自行车的车辙，没错，但不是那辆 自行车。每一辆自行车的轮胎都各不相同——我能分辨42种不同的轮胎。这一种是邓禄普轮胎，但是海德格的车用的是帕默轮胎。这是英语老师告诉我的。所以骑这辆车的不是海德格。”

“那么是那男孩儿吗？”我问。

“可能不是，那男孩儿没有骑自行车。”福尔摩斯说。他又看了一眼泥土中的车辙。“这个车辙是从学校那边过来的。”

“或者也许是往学校方向去 的？”我说。

“不，不，我亲爱的华生。看看这两道车辙，它们一样吗？”

“嗯，不一样，”我说，“其中一个轮胎的车辙印深一些。”

“那是后轮，”福尔摩斯说，“因为骑车的人当然是坐在后轮上。深一些的车辙是压在上面的那一道，因此这辆自行车走的是那条路，从学校那边过来穿过沼泽地一直骑下去。但是骑车的人是谁？他从哪里来？”

我们跟着邓禄普车胎的车辙往回走，回到了杂木林的附近。然后车辙就消失在一堆牛蹄印中，找不到了。福尔摩斯坐下来思考了几分钟。

“不，”他说着站了起来，“我们现在不要考虑这个问题。回到河边的淤泥那儿去，华生！”

两小时后福尔摩斯发出一声欢呼。我飞快地向他跑过去，看到淤泥中一条又长又窄的车辙。这正是帕默轮胎的车辙。

“这是海德格的！”福尔摩斯叫道，“我们跟着这个，华生。”

我们跟着帕默轮胎的车辙走了一公里或许更多，向北穿过沼泽地，车辙印不见了，然后又找到了，又不见了，又找到了。突然，车辙印断了。

“这里发生过什么？”我说，“他摔下来了？”

福尔摩斯仔细地看了看地面，然后他向开着黄花的小灌木丛走去。“看。”他平静地说。

有一朵黄花上面溅着红色的东西——深红褐色的血。

“糟糕！”福尔摩斯说，“糟糕！我从这里看出了什么？有什么东西或什么人击中了他。他倒下了，接着又站了起来，他又爬上自行车，然后骑走了。但是这里没有别的车辙了。有一些牛蹄印，但是没有脚印。我们必须跟着这血迹，华生。”

我们很快就找到了自行车，然后在灌木丛后面看到了一只鞋，又发现了一具尸体。那男人的头上和脸上都是血，已经死了。他穿着鞋，但是没有穿袜子，敞开的外衣里面套着睡衣。他就是那个德语老师。

“可怜的人，”福尔摩斯轻声说，“我们应该做些什么，华生？我们不能再浪费时间了，但是必须把这个可怜人的事告诉给谁。”

“要我跑回学校吗？”我说。

“不，我需要你跟着我。”福尔摩斯站起来，朝四周看了看。“看！”他说，“那边有个工人。他可以为我们去一趟学校。”

我去把那个工人叫了过来，福尔摩斯给赫克斯特伯博士写了一张便条。可怜的工人看了一眼尸体，便飞快地跑下小山，朝杂木林跑去。

“现在，”福尔摩斯说，“在继续工作之前，我们仔细考虑一下。到目前为止，我们都知道些什么？首先，孩子是自愿离开的。他穿戴整齐，不是突然出走。他愿意去——也许是和什么人一起，也许没有别人。但是德语老师没穿袜子和衬衫就走了，说明他是匆忙离开的。”

“没错。”我说。

“海德格为什么要走？因为透过他卧室的窗户，他看到了那个男孩儿。因为他想跟着他并把他带回学校。就这些，不错。但是为什么海德格没有追到男孩儿？成年人轻而易举地就能比孩子跑得快——但是海德格没有这么做。他骑了自行车，他知道他需要 自行车。为什么？”

“啊，”我说，“因为那男孩儿有自行车。”

“不要这么快就下结论，华生。仔细想想。海德格死在离学校8公里外的地方，说明那男孩儿走得非常快，因为走出8公里 以后，骑着自行车的成年人才赶上他。而且海德格死了是因为有人猛击他的头部。一个孩子是做不到这个的，因此说有人和男孩儿在一起 ——是一个男人，让我们姑且这么推测。但是我们仔细查看了可怜的海德格身边的泥土，华生，我们发现什么了？一些牛蹄印，但是此外就没有别的了。没有人的脚印，也没有自行车的车辙。”

“福尔摩斯，”我叫道，“这是不可能的。”

“很好，华生，”他说，“这不可能，因此我的想法有点儿问题。错在什么地方呢？”

“也许，”我说，“海德格摔下来的时候摔破了自己的脑袋？”

“在泥里摔破了脑袋，华生？”

“哦，我不知道，我真的不知道。”

“得啦，得啦，华生，”福尔摩斯说，“每个秘密都有它的答案。但是现在，帕默轮胎没能告诉我们更多的东西，因此我们必须回去找邓禄普轮胎。”

我们又找到了邓禄普轮胎的车辙，跟着它往北走。这里的泥不多，我们便看不到车辙了。现在我们能看到沼泽对面的霍尔德内斯府，在我们左边的几公里之外，在我们的前方，能看到切斯特菲尔德路。我们沿着那条路，朝林中人客栈走去。

5A visit to the Green Man

A visit to the Green Man

When we were near the inn, Holmes suddenly cried out. 'Aaah! My foot! I can't stand on it. Help me, Watson.'

I took his arm, and we walked slowly to the door of the inn. A man stood there, smoking, and watching us.

'How are you, Mr Reuben Hayes?' said Holmes.

'Who are you, and how do you know my name?' said the man. He looked very unfriendly.

'Because it's on the door of the inn, over your head,' said Holmes. 'But can you help me, Mr Hayes?'

'No, I can't.'

'But I need help. I can't put my foot to the ground.'

'Well, don't put it to the ground.'

Holmes smiled. 'Look,' he said. 'It's very important, and I can offer you a pound for the use of a bicycle.'

'Where do you want to go?' asked Mr Hayes.

'To Holdernesse Hall.'

'Oh, friends of the Duke, are you?' Mr Hayes laughed, looking at our muddy shoes and trousers.

Holmes laughed too. 'Well, we are bringing him news of his lost son,' he said. 'The boy is in Liverpool.'

Mr Hayes's face went white, then red. 'Oh,' he said carefully. 'That's... er, that's good news. I worked for the Duke once, but he wasn't good to me. I don't like him, but I'm pleased about the boy.'

We all went into the inn. 'Now,' said Holmes, something to eat first, please. Then you can bring round the bicycle.'

'I haven't got a bicycle,' said Mr Hayes.

Holmes put a pound on the table.

'I tell you, man, that I haven't got a bicycle! You can have two horses to take you to the Hall.'

He brought us something to eat, and we ate hungrily. Through the window we could see the stables at the back of the inn. Once Holmes got up and walked round the room, then stood, looking out of the window at the stables. Surprisingly, his foot was now very much better.

Suddenly he laughed, and looked at me. 'I've got it!' he cried. 'Yes, of course that's it. Watson, did you see any cow tracks today?'

'Yes,' I said. 'Lots of them. Everywhere.'

'And how many cows did you see on the moor?'

'I don't remember any,' I said.

'Isn't that strange, Watson? Lots of cow tracks, but no cows? And do you remember those tracks, Watson?' He took out his notebook. 'There were tracks like this:

：：：：：：：：：：

and sometimes like this:

：．：．：．：．：．：．：．

and sometimes like this:

.·.·.·.·.·.·.·

Do you remember that, Watson?'

'No, I don't,' I said. 'What does it mean, Holmes?'

'It means that it's a very strange cow, Watson! Cows don't move like that. Now, let's go quietly out and have a look round these stables.'

There were two tired-looking horses in the stables. Holmes looked carefully at one of the horse's feet, and laughed. 'Look, Watson. Old shoes, but new nails. Oh, this case gets more interesting every minute.'

I began to ask Holmes a question, but suddenly we heard someone behind us, and there was Mr Reuben Hayes. His face was red and angry.

'What are you doing in my stables?' he cried.

'We're just looking at your horses, Mr Hayes,' said Holmes, smiling. 'Why? Are you afraid of something?'

The man opened his mouth, then closed it quickly. His face was still red and angry. Holmes did not give him time to speak.'

'I think your horses are tired, Mr Hayes. We can walk to the Hall. It's not far.'

'Three kilometres, by the road,' Mr Hayes said. His eyes still watched us angrily.

It was nearly dark when we left. We walked along the road for about a hundred metres. Then Holmes took my arm. 'Quick, Watson! Off the road and up the hill. Then we can come down the hill at the back of the inn.'

We ran up the hill. 'This man Hayes,' I said. 'He knows all about the kidnapping. Is that right, Holmes?'

'Of course it is,' he said. 'We can learn a lot more from Mr Hayes. Ah! Who's this? Watson, get down!'

There was a bicycle on the road. It came past us very quickly, and we saw the rider—Mr James Wilder, the Duke's secretary. His face was white and afraid.

'Quick, Watson!' said Holmes. 'We must watch him.'

We ran down the hill, and stopped when we could see the back door of the inn. Wilder's bicycle was by the wall near the door. For five minutes, nothing happened; then a man on a horse rode quickly out of the stables and disappeared down the road.

'What do you think of that, Watson?' said Holmes.

'Somebody's running away.'

'Yes. But not James Wilder, because there he is at the door.'

We could see Wilder in the light from the door. He stood there, looking out, and ten minutes later another man came down the road and went into the inn. Then a light came on in a room upstairs.

'Come, Watson. We must get nearer,' Holmes said.

We went down the hill and walked very quietly to the back door of the inn. The bicycle was still by the wall. Holmes looked at the wheel, and laughed quietly.

'A Dunlop tyre, Watson! Now, I must look through that upstairs window, so I need your back, Watson.'

Holmes stood on my back, but only for a second, and then he was down again. 'Come, my friend,' he said. 'It's a long walk to the school, so let's start at once. I can give you all the answers to this mystery tomorrow.'

It was a long, cold, muddy walk back to the school. I went to bed at once, but Holmes went out again, to Mackleton, I think. I was very tired, and slept all night like a dead man.

5 ．拜访林中人客栈

就在我们走近那家客栈时，福尔摩斯突然大叫起来。“啊！我的脚！我站不住了。帮帮我，华生。”

我扶着他的胳膊，慢慢地往客栈的门口走去。一个男人站在那里，一边抽烟一边看着我们。

“你好吗，鲁本·海斯先生？”福尔摩斯说。

“你是谁，你怎么知道我的名字？”那男人说。他看起来非常不友好。

“因为名字写在客栈的门上，就在你的头顶上方，”福尔摩斯说，“你能帮我个忙吗，海斯先生？”

“不，不能。”

“但是我需要帮助。我的脚不能着地了。”

“那就不要着地。”

福尔摩斯笑了。“你看，”他说，“这很重要，而且我可以付1英镑来借用你的自行车。”

“你想去什么地方？”海斯先生问。

“去霍尔德内斯府。”

“哦，公爵的朋友，是吗？”海斯先生看着我们满是泥浆的鞋和裤子大笑。

福尔摩斯也笑了。“啊，我们要带给他有关他失踪的儿子的消息，”他说，“那男孩儿在利物浦。”

海斯先生的脸色先是一阵苍白，接着变红了。“哦，”他小心翼翼地说，“那是……嗯，那是个好消息。我曾经为公爵工作过，但是他对我不好。我不喜欢他，可我喜欢那个孩子。”

我们都进了客栈。“现在，”福尔摩斯说，“请先来点吃的东西，然后把你的自行车拿来。”

“我没有自行车。”海斯先生说。

福尔摩斯在桌子上放了一英镑。

“我告诉你，伙计，我没有自行车！你可以找两匹马来带你们去那宅子。”

他给我们拿了些食物，我们狼吞虎咽地吃着。透过窗户我们可以看到客栈后面的马厩。有那么一次福尔摩斯站了起来，在房间里踱来踱去，然后站住，从窗户向外看着马厩。奇怪的是这时候他的脚好多了。

突然他笑了起来，看着我。“我得出答案了！”他叫道，“是的，当然是这样。华生，今天你看到牛蹄印了吗？”

“是的，”我说，“有许多，到处都是。”

“你在沼泽地里看到多少头牛？”

“我不记得看见过。”我说。

“这不是很奇怪吗，华生？有许多牛蹄印，却没有牛？你还记得那些蹄印吗，华生？”他拿出笔记本，“有些像这样：

：：：：：：：：：：

有时像这样：

：．：．：．：．：．：．：．

有时又像这样：

.·.·.·.·.·.·.·

你记得吗，华生？”

“不，记不得了，”我说，“这是什么意思呢，福尔摩斯？”

“这意味着它是一头非常奇怪的牛，华生！牛不会那样走路。现在，我们悄悄地出去看看那些马厩。”

马厩里有两匹看上去很疲惫的马。福尔摩斯仔细看了看其中一匹马的马蹄，笑了。“瞧，华生。蹄铁是旧的，但钉子是新的。哦，这个案子变得越来越有意思了。”

我正要问福尔摩斯一个问题，突然我们听到背后有人，是鲁本·海斯先生。他的脸涨得通红，怒气冲冲的。

“你们在我的马厩里干什么？”他大喊。

“我们只是看看你的马，海斯先生，”福尔摩斯微笑着说，“干吗这么激动？你在害怕什么吗？”

那人张开嘴，然后又立刻闭上了。他的脸依然涨红着，怒气冲冲的。福尔摩斯没有给他说话的时间。

“我觉得你的马累了，海斯先生。我们可以步行到那宅子去，路程不远。”

“沿大路走有3公里。”海斯先生说。他的眼睛依然看着我们，余怒未消。

我们离开的时候天都快黑了。我们沿着大路走了100米左右，然后福尔摩斯拉着我的胳膊。“快，华生！离开大路往山上爬，然后我们可以从山上下到那家客栈的后面。”

我们跑上了山。“这个海斯，”我说，“他对这起绑架知道得一清二楚，对吗，福尔摩斯？”

“当然是这样，”他说，“我们可以从海斯先生那里了解到更多的情况。啊！这是谁？华生，蹲下！”

路上有一辆自行车。它从我们身边飞驰而过，我们看清了骑车的人——詹姆斯·怀尔德先生，公爵的秘书。他的脸色苍白，一副惊恐的样子。

“快点儿，华生！”福尔摩斯说，“我们必须盯住他。”

我们跑下山，看见客栈后门的时候停了下来。怀尔德的自行车靠在门边的墙上。我们等了5分钟，什么也没发生；然后有个人骑着马从马厩里飞快地跑了出来，消失在路的尽头。

“对此你怎么看，华生？”福尔摩斯说。

“有人跑了。”

“是的。但那不是詹姆斯·怀尔德，因为他还在门边。”

借着从门里面透出来的灯光，我们可以看见怀尔德。他站在那儿，眼睛看着外边，10分钟后又有一个男人从路那边过来，进了客栈，然后楼上一个房间的灯亮了。

“来，华生。我们必须靠近些。”福尔摩斯说。

我们下了山，悄悄地走近客栈的后门。那辆自行车还靠在墙边。福尔摩斯看了看车轮，悄无声息地笑了。

“邓禄普车胎，华生！现在，我必须往楼上那扇窗户里面看。所以我需要用一下你的后背，华生。”

福尔摩斯站在我的背上，但是只过了一会儿功夫他就下来了。“走，我的朋友，”他说，“还要走好长一段路才能到学校，所以我们马上往回走吧。明天我就可以告诉你这个谜案的全部答案。”

回学校的路途漫长、寒冷又泥泞。我马上上床睡觉了，但是福尔摩斯又出去了，我想他是去麦克尔顿。我非常疲劳，整夜睡得像个死人一样。

6Sherlock Holmes talks to the Duke

Sherlock Holmes talks to the Duke

At eleven o'clock the next morning Holmes and I were in the Duke's office at Holdernesse Hall. Mr Wilder came to speak to us.

'The Duke can see no one today,' he said to Holmes.

Holmes looked at him coldly. 'The Duke can see me,' he said. 'Please tell him that I am here.'

After half an hour the Duke of Holdernesse came into the room. He looked older—tired and ill.

'Well, Mr Holmes?' he said.

Holmes looked at James Wilder. 'I can speak more freely without your secretary here, sir.'

'Very well,' said the Duke tiredly. 'Please, James...'

James Wilder gave Holmes an angry look, but he went out of the room and shut the door.

Holmes looked at the Duke. 'You are offering, I hear, five thousand pounds for news of your son.'

'True.'

'And another thousand pounds for the name of the kidnapper.'

'True.'

My friend smiled. 'I see your cheque book on the table, sir. I would like to have your cheque for six thousand pounds.'

'Mr Sherlock Holmes,' the Duke said angrily, 'what is this about? Do you have news of my son, or not?'

'Oh, yes,'said Holmes.

The Duke's eyes never left Holmes's face. 'Where is my son?' he said quietly.

'He is—or was last night—at the Green Man Inn, three kilometres along the road to Chesterfield.'

The Duke fell back in his chair.

'And the name of the kidnapper?'

Sherlock Holmes's answer was a very surprising one. 'You ,' he said. 'And now, sir, your cheque, please.'

The Duke stood up, his face white and angry. Then he sat down again, and put his face in his hands. It was some minutes before he spoke.

'How much do you know?' he asked.

'I saw you with him last night,' said Holmes.

'And how many people know about this?'

'Only I and my friend here, Dr Watson.'

The Duke took out a pen, opened his cheque book, and began to write. 'When I made this offer, I didn't know...' He stopped, then began again. 'Are you and your friend going to talk about this, Mr Holmes?'

'I don't understand you, sir,' said Holmes.

'I mean...Nobody needs to know about this—this little family mystery. Just you and your friend Watson. Look, here is my cheque for twelve thousand pounds.'

Holmes gave him a cold little smile. 'I'm sorry, sir. There is a dead man in this case. You remember?'

'But that wasn't James!' cried the Duke. 'He knew nothing about it. He was very, very unhappy when he heard about the—the killing.'

'Murder,' said Holmes.

'But James wasn't there! And when he heard about it, he came to me at once, and told me everything. Oh, Mr Holmes, you must help him—you must! He is not the murderer! The murderer ran away last night.'

Holmes smiled again. 'I have a little more news for you, sir. The police met Mr Reuben Hayes last night at Chesterfield station. Mr Hayes is not running anywhere for a very long time.'

The Duke looked at Holmes with an open mouth. 'You—you know everything!' he said. 'But I am pleased to hear about Hayes—he was always a bad man. And that news can only help James.'

'James? Your secretary?' said Holmes.

'No, sir. My son. James Wilder is my son.'

6 ．歇洛克·福尔摩斯和公爵的谈话

第二天上午11点钟，福尔摩斯和我到了霍尔德内斯府公爵的办公室。怀尔德先生过来接待我们。

“公爵今天不能会客。”他对福尔摩斯说。

福尔摩斯冷冷地看着他。“公爵可以见我，”他说，“请告诉他我在这里。”

半小时之后霍尔德内斯公爵走进房间。他看起来苍老了——疲惫不堪而且一副病容。

“哟，福尔摩斯先生？”他说。

福尔摩斯看着詹姆斯·怀尔德。“您的秘书不在场的话，我说话会更方便一些，先生。”

“很好，”公爵疲惫地说。“詹姆斯，请……”

詹姆斯愠怒地瞪了福尔摩斯一眼，但他还是离开了房间，并随手关上了门。

福尔摩斯看着公爵。“听说您悬赏5,000英镑获取您儿子的消息。”

“确有此事。”

“另外还悬赏1,000英镑获得绑架者的名字。”

“没错。”

我的朋友笑了笑。“我看到桌子上放着您的支票本，先生。我想向您索要一张6,000英镑的支票。”

“歇洛克·福尔摩斯先生，”公爵生气地说，“这话是什么意思？你有没有我儿子的消息？”

“哦，有。”福尔摩斯说。

公爵目不转睛地盯着福尔摩斯的脸。“我儿子在哪里？”他平静地说。

“他现在——或者昨天晚上——在林中人客栈，沿着大路往切斯特菲尔德方向走三公里的地方。”

公爵颓然地靠在了椅子上。

“绑架者的名字呢？”

歇洛克·福尔摩斯的回答出人意料。“您 ，”他说，“现在，先生，请给我支票。”

公爵站起身，他的脸色苍白而又愤怒。然后他又坐了下去，用手捂着脸，足足过了几分钟才开口。

“你知道多少？”他问。

“昨天晚上我看到您和他在一起。”福尔摩斯说。

“现在有几个人知道此事？”

“只有我和我的这位朋友，华生医生。”

公爵拿出一枝钢笔，打开他的支票本，开始写。“当初我悬赏时，我不知道……”他停顿了一会儿，又接着说，“你和你的朋友会把这件事说出去吗，福尔摩斯先生？”

“我不明白您的意思，先生。”福尔摩斯说。

“我的意思是……不需要让任何人知道这件事——这是家庭小秘密，只有你和你的朋友华生知道就行。看，这是12,000英镑的支票。”

福尔摩斯微微冷笑着。“对不起，先生。这个案子里面牵涉到一个死人。您记得吗？”

“但那不是詹姆斯干的！”公爵大声说，“他对此事一无所知。当他听说这——这起杀人案时，他非常非常难过。”

“是谋杀。”福尔摩斯说。

“但是当时詹姆斯不在场！当他听说此事时，就立刻来见我，把一切都告诉了我。哦，福尔摩斯先生，你必须帮助他——你必须！他不是杀人凶手！凶手昨天晚上逃跑了。”

福尔摩斯又笑了。“我还有一个消息告诉您，先生。昨天晚上警察在切斯特菲尔德火车站遇到了鲁本·海斯先生。海斯先生很长一段时间内哪儿也去不了了。”

公爵瞠目结舌地看着福尔摩斯。“你——你什么都知道！”他说，“但是我很高兴听到海斯的消息——他向来是个坏家伙，这个消息只会对詹姆斯有利。”

“詹姆斯？您的秘书？”福尔摩斯说。

“不，先生。我的儿子。詹姆斯·怀尔德是我儿子。”

7The Duke's son

The Duke's son

When the Duke said this, I was very surprised, but Holmes was surprised too.

'This is news to me,' he said. 'Can you tell me more?'

The Duke stood up, and walked round the room for a minute. 'I must tell you everything,' he said. 'I didn't want to talk about it, but I must. I see that now.'

He sat down again, and began his story. 'When I was a young man, Mr Holmes, I was in love—oh, so much in love. It only happens to you once, and this woman was the love of my life. I wanted her to be my wife—but she died. She left me this one child, and I loved him because of her. When I look in his face, I see her, and remember her, and can't stop loving her. I must have the boy near me because of this. But a government minister cannot tell the world about a love-child like this. So, to the world, James is my young secretary, not my son.

'He knows that I am his father. He hates the Duchess, because she is not his mother. And he hates my younger son, Arthur, because Arthur has everything. Arthur has a name, a famous father, houses, money, everything. James has nothing. Well, he has some money, of course, but he is just Mr James Wilder, and he wants to be the Duke of Holdernesse one day. That's not possible, of course, but James can't understand that. And so, you see, I was afraid for Arthur, and that's why I sent him to Dr Huxtable's school.

'And what does James do next? He kidnaps my poor Arthur. It changes nothing, but James can't see that. He wants me to say, "Yes, James, now you can be my first son; you can have everything. Arthur can be the number two son." But I can't do that, of course I can't.

'James knew this man Hayes, you see, because Hayes worked for me once. James asked for Hayes's help, and the man was happy to do it. You remember my letter to Arthur on that last day? Well, James opened the letter and put in a note from him. That evening he cycled across the moor and met Arthur in Ragged Shaw. He talked about the Duchess, Arthur's mother. "She wants to see you," he told Arthur. "She's waiting on the moor. Come back at midnight, and a man with a horse can take you to her." Of course, poor Arthur wanted to see his mother, so he came. Hayes was there with two horses, and they rode across the moor. But the German teacher followed them, and Hayes killed him. Hayes then took Arthur to the Green Man.

'Well, Mr Holmes, I knew nothing about any of this until the murder. James is a bad boy, but he does not murder people. When he heard the news, he came to me at once, crying. What could I do? I didn't want the world to know about this. So James went down to the Green Man. He told Hayes to run away, because everybody knew about the murder now—and knew the murderer's name too. Hayes left at once. Later, I went down and saw Arthur. I left him there with Mrs Hayes because I couldn't say anything to the police just then.

'So, Mr Holmes, now you know everything.'

'Mmm,' said Holmes. 'You help a murderer, you say nothing to the police, you leave your young son in a dirty inn...and you ask for my help.'

People never spoke to the Duke of Holdernesse like this usually. His face was red, but he said nothing.

'First,' said Holmes, 'we must bring Arthur home.'

'Yes,' the Duke said quietly.

Holmes quickly wrote a note and took it out of the room. A minute later, he was back. 'Now, what are you going to do about Mr James Wilder?' he said.

'I understand you, Mr Holmes,' said the Duke. 'James is leaving me and going to Australia next week.'

'Good,' said Holmes. 'And the Duchess? Perhaps without James in the house, you and she...'

'Yes. I wrote to the Duchess this morning.'

Holmes stood up. 'Well,' he said, 'Watson and I can go home now, I think. There is just one other small thing... This man Hayes took two horses across the moor, but the horses' feet made the tracks of a cow in the mud. How was this possible?'

The Duke looked surprised and thought for a minute. Then he went away and came back two minutes later with a glass box in his hands. In the box were some horse-shoes.

'We found these shoes under the ground in the garden,' the Duke said. 'They are about five hundred years old, we think. The Holdernesse family has a long and interesting past.'

Holmes opened the box and took out one shoe. It was a shoe for a horse's foot, but it looked like a cloven cow's foot. Holmes wet his finger and ran it round the bottom of the shoe. A little mud came off on his finger.

'Thank you,' said Holmes. He put the horse-shoe back in its box. 'That shoe is the second most interesting thing in the north of England,' he said.

'And the first?' asked the Duke.

Holmes took the cheque for twelve thousand pounds from the table, and slowly put it into his notebook, 'I am a poor man,' he said. He looked lovingly at the notebook, then put it carefully in his pocket.

7 ．公爵的儿子

公爵的话让我大吃一惊，甚至连福尔摩斯也感到很意外。

“这对我来说可是个新闻，”他说，“您能告诉我更多的情况吗？”

公爵站起来，在房间里转了一会儿。“我必须把一切都告诉你们，”他说，“我不想说起这件事，但是现在我知道我必须说了。”

他又坐了下来，开始讲述自己的故事。“当我还是一个年轻小伙子的时候，福尔摩斯先生，我坠入了情网——哦，很痴迷。这种感情一个人只能迸发一次，这个女人是我一生的爱。我想娶她为妻——但是她撒手人寰了。她给我留下了这个孩子，我因为爱她而爱这个孩子。当我看着他的脸的时候，我就看到她，想起她，情不自禁地爱她。因为这个原因我必须让这个孩子跟在我身边。但是作为内阁部长，我不能让外界知道这个私生子的存在。因此，对外界来说，詹姆斯是我年轻的秘书，而不是我的儿子。

“他知道我是他父亲。他恨公爵夫人，因为她不是他的母亲。他也恨我的小儿子阿瑟，因为阿瑟拥有一切。阿瑟有姓氏、有一位声名显赫的父亲、有房产、有金钱，拥有一切，而詹姆斯却一无所有。当然，他有一些钱，但是他只能是詹姆斯·怀尔德先生，而他想有朝一日成为霍尔德内斯公爵。那当然是不可能的，可是詹姆斯无法理解这些。所以，你看，我为阿瑟担心，这就是我送他去赫克斯特伯博士的学校上学的原因。

“詹姆斯后来又做了什么？他绑架了我可怜的阿瑟。这并不能改变事实，但是詹姆斯不理解这一点。他想让我说：‘是的，詹姆斯，现在你是我的大儿子；你可以拥有一切。阿瑟是我的二儿子。’但是我不能这么做，我当然不能这么做。

“詹姆斯认识海斯，你知道，因为海斯曾经为我工作过。詹姆斯请求海斯的帮助，那个男人非常高兴做这事。你记得出事的前一天我写给阿瑟的信吗？嗯，詹姆斯拆开了那封信，放入自己写的一张便条。那天晚上他骑自行车穿过沼泽地，在杂木林见了阿瑟。他说起公爵夫人，也就是阿瑟的母亲。‘她想见你，’他告诉阿瑟，‘她在沼泽地等你。午夜之后过来，有一个骑马的人会带你去见她。’可怜的阿瑟当然想见母亲，所以他就去了。海斯牵着两匹马去了那里，他们骑马穿过沼泽地。但是德语老师跟着他们，海斯杀了他。然后海斯带着阿瑟去了林中人客栈。

“哦，福尔摩斯先生，我对此一无所知——直到凶杀案发生之后我才获悉。詹姆斯是个坏孩子，但是他没有杀人。当他听到这个消息时，立刻哭着来见我。我能怎么办呢？我不想让外界知道这件事。所以詹姆斯去了林中人客栈。他让海斯逃跑，因为现在每个人都知道凶杀案了——也知道凶手的名字。海斯马上逃走了。后来，我去见阿瑟。因为当时我什么也不能对警察说，所以我就把他留在那儿，和海斯夫人待在一起。

“因此，福尔摩斯先生，现在你全都知道了。”

“嗯，”福尔摩斯说，“您帮助一个凶手，您什么也没有告诉警察，您把您的小儿子丢在脏兮兮的客栈……您还请求我帮忙。”

从来没有人这么跟霍尔德内斯公爵说过话。他的脸红了，但是一言不发。

“首先，”福尔摩斯说，“我们必须带阿瑟回家。”

“是的。”公爵轻声说。

福尔摩斯飞快地写了一张便条并拿着它走出了房间。一分钟之后，他回来了。“现在，您打算怎么处置詹姆斯·怀尔德先生？”他说。

“我理解你的意思，福尔摩斯先生，”公爵说，“詹姆斯准备下星期离开我去澳大利亚。”

“好，”福尔摩斯说，“公爵夫人呢？也许没有詹姆斯在这个家里，您和她……”

“是的。今天早上我写信给公爵夫人了。”

福尔摩斯站了起来。“好，”他说，“我觉得华生和我现在可以回家了。不过还有一件小事情……这个海斯牵着两匹马穿过沼泽地，但是那马蹄在泥地里留下了牛的蹄印。这怎么可能呢？”

公爵看上去很意外，他思索了一会，然后走了出去，两分钟后他回来了，手里拿着一个玻璃盒。盒里有几个马蹄铁。

“我们在花园的地里发现了这些马蹄铁，”公爵说，“我们觉得它们大概有500年的历史了。霍尔德内斯家族的历史漫长而有趣。”

福尔摩斯打开盒子，拿出一只马蹄铁。它是用来钉在马蹄上的，但看上去像是一只牛的偶蹄。福尔摩斯把手指弄湿，顺着马蹄铁底部绕了一圈。他的手指沾上了一点泥。

“谢谢。”福尔摩斯说。他把马蹄铁放回盒子里。“这马蹄铁是英国北部第二有趣的东西。”他说。

“那最有趣的是什么呢？”公爵问。

福尔摩斯从桌子上拿起12,000英镑的支票，慢慢地把它夹在自己的笔记本里。“我是个穷人。”他说。他满心欢喜地看着笔记本，然后小心翼翼地把它装进口袋。

内容简介

海洛因能杀人。但是，在杀人之前，海洛因首先会改变一个人。它将你的朋友变成敌人；将你的爱人变成陌生人。海洛因杀死人的躯体——但它首先摧毁人的心灵。

安娜·哈兰认为她了解自己的女儿萨拉。她知道萨拉不会贩卖海洛因。但是，爱情也能改变一个人。萨拉正在恋爱——和一个陌生人恋爱。她的包里为什么会有海洛因？是给她的男朋友带的吗？

有人要死了——但会是谁？是吸食海洛因的人？还是贩卖海洛因的人？抑或是一个从未碰过海洛因的年轻女孩？海洛因就是白色死亡。如果它能够的话，它将把这些人都杀死。

WHITE DEATH

Heroin kills. But before it kills, heroin changes people. It changes your friend into your enemy; it changes someone you love into a stranger. Heroin kills the body—but first it kills the heart.

Anna Harland thinks that she knows her daughter, Sarah. She knows that Sarah does not sell heroin. But love can change people, too. And Sarah is in love—with a stranger. Why did she have heroin in her bag? Was she carrying it for her boyfriend?

Someone is going to die—but who? The person who uses the heroin? The person who sells it? Or a young girl who never touches it? Heroin is the White Death. And, if it can, the White Death is going to kill them all.

Chapter 1

The woman stood in front of the prison. The prison was a big, dirty building in the biggest town of a hot country. The woman was very hot, and she did not like the noise from all the cars in the road. She was an Englishwoman and she did not like hot countries or a lot of noise. She was tall, about fifty years old, with blue eyes and a long face. Her face was red, and she looked tired and angry.

She knocked at the door of the prison. For a long time nothing happend. Then a little window opened in the door, and a man looked out at her.

'Yes? What do you want?'

'I want to see my daughter. It's very important.'

'Name?'

'Anna Harland.'

'Is that your name or your daughter's name?'

'It's my name. My daughter's name is Sarah Harland.'

'You can't visit her today. Come back on Wednesday.'

'No! I came from England to see her today. It's very important. She's going to court tomorrow. Please take me to her—now!'

'Wait a minute.'

The little window closed, but the door did not open. The woman waited in front of the door for a long time. A lot of people in the road looked at her. One or two young men laughed, but she did not move. She stood there in the hot road in front of the prison door, and waited.

After twenty minutes, the door opened. 'Come with me,' the man said. The woman went in with him. It was dark in the prison, and at first she could not see very well. She walked for a long time, past hundreds of doors. Then the man opened one of them.

'In here,' he said. 'You can have ten minutes.'

Anna Harland walked into the room and the man went in after her. He closed the door behind him. There was a table in the room, and two chairs. On one of the chairs sat her daughter, Sarah. She was a tall girl, about nineteen years old, with big blue eyes.

'Mother!' she said. 'I'm very happy to see you.' And she got up and began to run across the room to her mother.

'Sarah!' Anna said, and put out her arms. But the man moved quickly and stood between them.

'No,' he said to Anna. 'I'm sorry. I know you're her mother. You can talk, but that's all. Please sit down at the table. I am here to watch you.'

The mother and daughter sat down at the table. Anna's hands were near Sarah's on the table. She looked carefully at her daughter. Sarah's dress and face were dirty. 'She's tired, and unhappy,' Anna thought.

'Sarah, what happened?' she said. 'We have ten minutes to talk. No more. Tell me, please, quickly. I want to help you.'

Sarah looked at her mother. 'Oh, mother, I'm happy you're here. I wanted you to come. Mother, I ... I didn't do it. It isn't true. Please believe me.'

'Of course I believe you, Sarah. But tell me about it. What happened? Quickly. Begin at the beginning.'

'Yes, but ... I don't know ... When did it begin? I don't know ... I don't understand it.'

'Why did the police arrest you? When did they bring you to this prison?'

'Last week, I think. Yes, last week. At the airport, when we arrived ... The police stopped us, and looked in our bags. Then ...'

Sarah looked down at the table. 'She's crying,' Anna thought. 'She's very unhappy.'

'What happened then, Sarah?' her mother asked.

'They ... they said there were drugs in my bag. Then they took me into a room and told me to take my dress off. They looked for more drugs, but they found nothing. Then ... then they brought me here.'

'I see. Where were the drugs, then? Where did they find them?'

'Oh. They didn't tell you?' Sarah stopped crying. She looked up, and there was a smile on her face. But it was not a happy smile. 'The drugs were in a tube of toothpaste. A toothpaste tube with drugs in it ... heroin ... not toothpaste.'

'And you didn't know about it?'

'No, mother, of course not. Do you think I clean my teeth with heroin?'

Anna Harland smiled. It was difficult to smile, because she was afraid. But she smiled because she wanted to help her daughter.

'I know you don't clean your teeth with heroin. You have very good teeth, Sarah. But ... what about Stephen? Did he know about the heroin? Did he put it in the toothpaste tube?'

'Stephen? No ... why do you ask about Stephen, mother?'

'Well, is he in prison too? You said "us" and "our bags". Did the police arrest him too?'

'Oh ... no,' Sarah's face was unhappy. 'No. I wasn't with Stephen, mother. You see, Stephen and I ... well, we aren't friends now. I left him about two months ago ... and then I met Hassan.'

'Hassan?'

'Yes. I was with Hassan at the airport. Stephen was on the plane too—I don't know why—but he wasn't with me. It's Hassan—he was with me. Hassan's important to me now, not Stephen.'

Anna looked at her daughter. 'I see. And did the police arrest this Hassan too? Is he in prison?'

'Yes, he is. They arrested him but I can't see him. I asked them. I wanted to see him. But they said "no". Mother, I'm sure Hassan didn't know about the heroin. He's a good man ... he didn't know, I'm sure.'

'Then why was the heroin in your bag, Sarah?'

'I don't know, mother ... I don't know.'

The man looked at the clock in the room. 'I'm sorry, Mrs Harland,' he said. 'But that's ten minutes. It's time to go.'

Anna Harland stood up slowly. 'All right,' she said. 'But don't be afraid, Sarah. I'm coming to the court tomorrow.'

'Yes, mother,' Sarah said. 'Thank you. The police are bringing Hassan to court tomorrow too, I think. You can see him there. He's a good man, mother, and ... I'm sure he didn't know about the drugs.'

'Perhaps,' Anna said. She walked slowly to the door, and then stood by the door and looked at her daughter again. 'Sarah ... you are telling me the truth, aren't you?'

Sarah began to cry again. 'Yes, mother, of course I am. I always tell you the truth, you know that.'

Anna smiled. 'Yes, Sarah,' she said quietly. 'Yes, I believe you.' She went through the door and the man went out after her.

Sarah sat quietly at the table in the room, and looked at her hands. 'Yes,' she thought. 'I told you the truth, mother. I always tell you the truth. But I didn't tell you everything ...' She put her head in her hands.

第一章

监狱前面站着一个女人。这个监狱是个又大又破的建筑物，坐落在一个气候炎热的国家最大的城镇里。女人感到很热，她还很讨厌路上飞驰而过的汽车的噪音。她是个英国人，既不喜欢气候炎热的国家，也不喜欢嘈杂。她高高的个子，大约有50岁，蓝眼睛，长脸。她的脸红红的，看起来很疲惫，而且满面怒色。

她敲打着监狱的门。很长一段时间过去了，但一点动静也没有。接着，门上开了一扇小窗，一个男人向外看着她。

“嗨，你有什么事儿吗？”

“我要见我女儿，这很重要。”

“叫什么名字？”

“安娜·哈兰。”

“这是你的名字，还是你女儿的名字？”

“我的名字。我女儿的名字叫萨拉·哈兰。”

“今天你不能见她，星期三再来吧。”

“不！我从英格兰赶来，就是要在今天见她。这很重要。她明天就上法庭了。请您带我去见她吧——就现在！”

“请稍候。”

那扇小窗关上了，门却没有开。女人又在门前等了很长时间。路上的很多人都在看她。有一两个年轻人还冲着她笑，但是她没有离开。她站在监狱门前热得发烫的路上，等着。

20分钟后，门开了。“跟我来，”那人说。女人就跟着他进去了。监狱里很暗，开始时，她看不大清楚。她走了很长时间，经过了成百上千扇门。然后，那人打开了其中的一扇门。

“在里面，”他说，“你有10分钟的时间。”

安娜·哈兰走进了那个房间，那人也跟着她进来了。他随手关上了门。房间里有一张桌子和两把椅子。其中一把椅子上坐着她的女儿，萨拉。她是一个高个子女孩，大约19岁，蓝色的眼睛大大的。

“妈妈！”她喊道，“能见到你我太高兴了！”她站起来，要穿过房间，奔向她的妈妈。

“萨拉！”安娜说着，伸出了双臂。但是那人很快冲了过来，站在她们的中间。

“不行，”他对安娜说，“很抱歉，我知道你是她的母亲。你们可以交谈，但仅此而已。请坐在桌子旁边。我在这儿看着你们。”

母女在桌前相视而坐。安娜的手放在桌子上，离萨拉的手很近。她仔细地打量着女儿。萨拉的衣服和脸都很脏。“她很累，而且不开心。”安娜想。

“萨拉，出了什么事？”她问，“我们可以谈10分钟，只有10分钟。来，快点告诉我。我想帮助你。”

萨拉看着她的母亲。“噢，妈妈，我很高兴你能来这儿。我一直盼着你来。妈妈，我……我没有那样做。那不是真的。请你相信我。”

“我当然相信你，萨拉。但是告诉我是怎么回事儿，到底发生了什么？快点，从头开始讲。”

“好吧，但是……我不知道……这是什么时候开始的呢？我不知道……我也不明白。”

“警察为什么要逮捕你？他们是什么时候把你带到这个监狱来的？”

“我想是上个星期。是的，是上个星期。在机场，我们刚到的时候……警察拦住了我们，检查我们的包。然后……”

萨拉低头看着桌子。“她在哭，”安娜想，“她很伤心。”

“后来呢，萨拉？”她妈妈问道。

“他们……他们说我的包里有毒品。他们把我带到一个房间里，让我脱下衣服。他们想找到更多的毒品，却什么也没发现。然后……然后他们就把我带到这儿来了。”

“我知道了。那么，毒品在哪儿呢？他们在哪儿发现的？”

“喔，他们没告诉你？”萨拉不再哭了。她抬起头，脸上还带着微笑，但那不是开心的笑，“毒品在牙膏管里。牙膏管里面装的是毒品……海洛因……而不是牙膏。”

“那你以前不知道这些吗？”

“当然不知道啦，妈妈。你以为我会用海洛因刷牙吗？”

安娜·哈兰笑了。笑得很艰难，因为她很害怕。但她还是笑了，因为她想帮助自己的女儿。

“我知道你不会用海洛因刷牙。你的牙齿很好，萨拉。但是……斯蒂芬呢？他知道海洛因的事吗？是他把海洛因装到牙膏管里的吗？”

“斯蒂芬？不……你为什么要问起斯蒂芬，妈妈？”

“喔，他也在监狱里吗？你刚才说‘我们’还有‘我们的包’。警察也把他抓起来了吗？”

“噢……不是的，”萨拉看起来不太高兴，“不，我没有和斯蒂芬在一起，妈妈。你知道，我和斯蒂芬……是这样的，我们现在不是朋友了。大约两个月前，我和他分手了……然后我遇到了哈桑。”

“哈桑？”

“是的。在机场的时候，我和哈桑在一起。斯蒂芬也在飞机上——我不知道为什么——但是他没和我在一起。是哈桑——他和我在一起。现在哈桑对我很重要，而不是斯蒂芬。”

安娜看着自己的女儿。“我明白了。警察也逮捕这个哈桑了吗？他在监狱里吗？”

“是的，他也在监狱里。他们也逮捕了他，但是我不能见他。我问过他们。我想见他，但是他们不准。妈妈，我敢保证哈桑不知道包里有海洛因。他是个好人……他不知道，我保证。”

“那海洛因怎么会在你的包里，萨拉？”

“我不知道，妈妈……我不知道。”

那人看了看房间里的时钟。“对不起，哈兰太太，”他说，“已经10分钟了。您得出去了。”

安娜·哈兰慢慢地站了起来。“好吧，”她说，“但是，别害怕，萨拉。我明天会去法庭旁听的。”

“好的，妈妈，”萨拉说，“谢谢你。我想，明天警察也会把哈桑带上法庭的。在那儿，你就能看到他了。他人不错，妈妈，并且……我保证他不知道毒品的事。”

“也许吧，”安娜说。她慢慢地向门口走去，然后站在门边，回头看着她的女儿，“萨拉，你跟我说的都是实话……是吗？”

萨拉又开始哭了。“是的，妈妈。我告诉你的当然是实话。你知道的，我从不撒谎。”

安娜笑了。“是的，萨拉，”她平静地说，“我相信你。”她穿过门走了出去，那个男人也跟在她后面出去了。

在房间里，萨拉静静地坐在桌前，看着自己的手。“是的，”她想，“我说的是实话，妈妈。我从不对你撒谎。但是我并没有把所有的都告诉你……”她把头埋在手里。

Chapter 2

Anna Harland left the prison and went to talk to the police. She waited a long time in a small office, but after an hour a policeman came into the room. He was a big man, about fifty-five years old, with brown eyes and a nice smile. He moved very slowly and quietly.

'Good afternoon, Mrs Harland,' he said. 'My name is Detective Inspector Aziz. I ... arrested your daughter three days ago. I'm very sorry for you. This is a very unhappy thing for a mother ...'

'It's a very unhappy thing for my daughter, Inspector,' Anna said angrily. 'Because she didn't do it. She's innocent, you know. She knows nothing about those drugs.'

Detective Inspector Aziz looked at her carefully for a minute. He did not know many English women. 'She has an interesting face,' he thought. 'Very blue eyes, and a long nose. She is not afraid of me, and she is not crying. Perhaps she wants to know the truth. Perhaps she can help me, too.'

'Well, Mrs Harland,' he said slowly. 'It's difficult for me. Is your daughter telling the truth? Is she innocent? Because the drugs were in her bag, you know.'

'I know,' Anna said. 'But she was with a young man ... Hassan. She doesn't know him very well, I think. Tell me about him, please, I want to know.'

Inspector Aziz smiled. 'All right,' he said. 'But first, tell me about your daughter. Why was she on that plane? Why did she come to this country? Tell me.'

Anna Harland looked at him. 'He's a nice man,' she thought. 'He listens to people. Perhaps he wants to help. Perhaps he can understand Sarah.'

'Do you have daughters?' she asked.

'Yes,' the Inspector answered. 'Two.'

'Then perhaps you can understand,' Anna said. 'Sarah is nineteen. She finished school last year, and she worked for six months in a hospital to get some money. Then she and her boyfriend, Stephen, visited a lot of countries. They went to Greece, Turkey, India, Australia—and now they're here. They're young, and they want to see new countries and new towns and new people. That's all.'

'I see,' the Inspector said. 'But sometimes young people do things—bad things—because they are in a different country and they need money.'

'Not Sarah,' Anna said. 'And not heroin. Sarah worked in a hospital, and she knows about heroin. She knows it can kill people. I'm a doctor, and she wants to be a doctor, too.'

'I see,' the Inspector said again. He looked at her, and thought, but he said nothing.

'Now,' Anna said. 'Tell me about this young man, Hassan.'

'All right,' the Inspector said. He took some papers from the table and began to read to her. 'But we don't know very much about him. He's a rich boy, from a good family. His father has two or three shops, I think. And the police in his town know him, too. Last year his father gave him a new car—a very fast car. And ... listen to this! One day he hit a police car, and the police car went into the river! What a story! His father bought a new car for the police. His father has a lot of money.'

The Inspector smiled, but Anna looked unhappy. 'Oh dear,' she said. 'That's not very good.'

'No,' he said. 'It isn't good. But this story about the heroin is worse. Much worse. I don't like this story.'

第二章

安娜·哈兰离开了监狱，接着又去找警察谈话。她在一个小办公室里等了很长一段时间。一个小时以后，一个警察走了进来。他个头不小，大约55岁上下，棕色的眼睛，脸上带着和蔼的笑容。他走得很慢而且脚步很轻。

“下午好，哈兰太太，”他说，“我是阿齐兹探长。三天前，我……逮捕了您的女儿。我很抱歉。对于一个母亲来说，这确实是一件令人难过的事情……”

“对我女儿来说也是如此，探长，”安娜愤怒地说，“因为那不是她干的。她是无辜的，她根本不知道那些毒品是怎么回事。”

阿齐兹探长盯着她认真地看了一会儿。他认识的英国女人不多。“她的脸很有意思，”他想，“蓝蓝的眼睛，长长的鼻子。她不怕我，也没有哭，也许她想知道事实的真相。她或许还能帮助我。”

“哦，哈兰太太。”他慢慢地说，“这对我来说也很难办。您的女儿说的是实话吗？她是无辜的吗？您知道，那些毒品可是在她的包里。”

“我知道，”安娜说，“但是她是和一个小伙子在一起……哈桑。我觉得她并不是很了解他。请告诉我关于他的情况，我想知道。”

阿齐兹探长笑了。“好的，”他说，“但是，首先告诉我你女儿的情况。她为什么会在那架飞机上？她为什么要来这个国家？告诉我。”

安娜·哈兰看着他。“他这个人不错，”她想，“他倾听别人说话。也许他想帮忙，也许他能理解萨拉。”

“你有女儿吗？”她问。

“有，”探长回答说，“有两个。”

“那样的话，也许你会理解，”安娜说，“萨拉19岁了。她去年从学校毕业，为了挣点钱，她在一家医院里工作了六个月。然后她就和她的男朋友斯蒂芬去了很多国家。他们去过希腊、土耳其、印度、澳大利亚——现在来到这儿。他们很年轻，想见识不同的国家和城镇，结识不同的人。就这样。”

“我明白，”探长说，“但是有时年轻人会做一些事情——坏事——因为他们身处异国他乡，需要钱。”

“萨拉不是这样的，”安娜说，“她也不会去贩卖海洛因。萨拉以前在一家医院工作，她知道海洛因的危害。她知道那会使人丧命。我是一个医生，而她也想成为一名医生。”

“我明白。”探长说。他看着她，思考着什么，却什么也没说。

“现在，”安娜说，“告诉我这个年轻人哈桑的情况。”

“好的，”探长说。他从桌子上拿起几份文件，开始读给她听，“但是我们对他也不甚了解。他家境不错，很有钱。我想他父亲开了两三家商店。镇里的警察也知道他。去年，他爸爸给了他一辆新车——跑得很快的那种车。还有……听这个！有一天，他撞了警察的车，并且将它撞到了河里。多糟糕啊！于是他父亲又给警察买了一辆新车。他爸爸很有钱。”

探长笑了，但是安娜却笑不出来。“噢，天哪，”她说，“这可不大好。”

“是的，”他说，“这不好，但这次海洛因的事就更糟糕了。非常糟糕。我不喜欢这个故事。”

Chapter 3

Next morning, Anna Harland went to the court. She was first there. She sat in the courtroom and waited. A lot of people came in, and she saw a man and his wife. 'Perhaps they're Hassan's father and mother,' Anna thought. But she did not want to talk to them.

The lawyers came in next, with a lot of papers. They sat at a table in front of her, and talked quietly.

'Those two lawyers,' Anna thought, 'they're old friends. But one of them wants my daughter to die, and one wants her to be free.'

After the lawyers, the jury came in—twelve people, men and women. They sat down and watched the lawyers. They looked at Anna, and then talked quietly about her. 'These people don't look very important,' she thought. 'But they are the most important people here. They're going to say "she did it"... or "she didn't do it". And then Sarah comes home to me ... or she dies.' She watched their faces carefully.

Then some policemen came in. Inspector Aziz saw Anna and smiled at her. But Anna did not talk to him, because Sarah came in at the same time. She looked afraid, and her face was very white. She looked across the courtroom, saw her mother, and gave her an unhappy smile.

There were two policemen behind Sarah, but Anna did not look at them. She looked at the tall dark young man next to Sarah—Hassan!

'He's about twenty years old,' Anna thought. 'He's very tall. But he has a nice face, and very beautiful dark eyes. Sarah likes him, and I can understand that. But he looks very unhappy, too ... and afraid. His hands are moving all the time.'

Hassan looked at Sarah and smiled. She smiled back at him. Anna wanted to talk to Sarah, but just then a policeman said loudly: 'All stand, please.' Everybody stood up, and the judge came into the courtroom. He went to his chair and sat down.

The police lawyer began. 'These two young people came into our country last week,' he said. 'The young man lives in this country, and the young woman is English. At the airport, the police looked in their bags, and they found three tubes of toothpaste. These tubes of toothpaste!'

He had the three tubes in his hand, and he looked at them. Everybody could see them.

'But are they tubes of toothpaste?' he asked. 'No, men and women of the jury, they are not. Oh no. There is no toothpaste in these tubes. There is heroin in them! Yes, heroin ... a bad, dirty drug. Perhaps the worst drug. People die from this drug. The "White Death", they call it.'

The lawyer stopped, and looked at the jury. He waited for a minute or two. The courtroom was very quiet. Then he began again.

'But why, you ask me—why did these two young people have this heroin in their bags? I can tell you. Because heroin is one of the most expensive drugs, too. They can sell these tubes of heroin in our country for perhaps eighty thousand pounds. Eighty thousand pounds! Easy money! And, men and women of the jury, many people in our country—young people, schoolchildren, too—take this drug. At first it's exciting and they feel happy. But then they need more and more heroin, and they need more money to buy the drug. They leave their homes and families. They take more heroin ... and more. They can't stop. Soon the drug begins to kill them. And in the end they die. The "White Death". It's not a quick death, and it's not an easy death. Yes, men and women of the jury, many young people and children—your children and my children, remember!—die because of this drug.'

The lawyer stopped again. The jury watched him, and waited.

'He's very good,' Anna thought. 'Very, very good. He's telling the jury an exciting story, and they like him. But it isn't good for Sarah.'

The lawyer walked across the courtroom and stood in front of the jury. 'But, my friends,' he said to the jury, 'we have a law in this country. And the law is not difficult to understand. When people bring heroin into this country, they bring death, too. We need to stop these people. And how can we do that? The answer is easy. The law for these people is death.'

The lawyer walked back to his table. 'Now please look at these two young people here in this court,' he said to the jury. 'They brought heroin into this country. The airport police are going to tell you about it. Please listen carefully. It's not a long story. And remember ... the law is death.'

The police lawyer sat down, and an airport policeman went to the front of the courtroom. Anna felt ill. She looked at Sarah. Sarah was white-faced and very afraid. Anna closed her eyes. 'Sarah,' she thought, 'Oh, Sarah.'

The police lawyer stood up again. 'Please tell the court about Sarah Harland and Hassan,' he said to the airport policeman.

'Yes, sir,' said the policeman. 'I found two tubes of toothpaste in the girl's bag, and one tube in the young man's bag. All three tubes had heroin in them.'

'Thank you.' The police lawyer sat down, and Mr Cheng—Sarah's and Hassan's lawyer—stood up.

'What did Sarah Harland say when you found the heroin?' he asked.

'Nothing, sir. She began to cry.'

'I see. Was she afraid?'

The policeman thought for a minute. 'I don't know, sir. Perhaps she was, yes.'

'And she said nothing? Are you sure?'

The policeman thought again. 'Well, yes, sir, I think perhaps she said: "This isn't my toothpaste. This is all wrong."'

'I see. And what about the young man, Hassan? What did he say?'

'Well, sir, he was very angry. He said: "It's not heroin. That's not true! You put it there!"'

'I see. Thank you. Now tell me, why did you look in these two young people's bags? You don't usually look in everyone's bags. There isn't time.'

The policeman thought again. 'Well, no, sir, we don't. I ... I'm afraid I can't tell you, sir.'

'What did you say?' Mr Cheng asked, very angrily. 'Of course you can tell me! This is a court of law!' He looked at the judge. 'This is a very important question. We need an answer!'

The judge looked at the airport policeman. 'I'm sorry,' he said. 'Please answer the question. The court needs to know the answer.'

'Yes, sir. Well, you see, there was a telephone call. Someone telephoned me before the plane arrived. The telephone caller said: "There's some heroin on the plane. A young man and a young woman are carrying it."'

'I see,' Mr Cheng said. He smiled. 'That's very interesting. And who made this telephone call?'

'I don't know,' the policeman said. 'It was a man, and he talked in English. I don't know his name.'

*　　*　　*

Suddenly Anna heard a noise. She looked behind her at the door of the courtroom. A tall young man came into the back of the room. Anna knew him at once. It was Stephen, Sarah's old boyfriend. A policeman took him to a chair near Anna. He saw Anna, and for a second he looked afraid. But then he smiled, and sat down next to her.

'Mrs Harland!' he said quietly. 'It's good to see you. When did you arrive?'

'Yesterday,' she said. 'Why are you late?'

'I couldn't find the court,' he answered. He looked very unhappy. 'Tell me how to help,' he said. 'I want to help Sarah, but what can I do? I was on the plane too, but I couldn't help her. I don't want her to die!'

'Stay with me, young man,' Anna said quietly. 'We can help her—I'm sure we can!'

*　　*　　*

Later that morning, Sarah went to the front of the courtroom. Her face was very white, and her eyes were red with crying. Her lawyer—Mr Cheng—began to ask her questions.

'Now, Miss Harland, why did you come to this country?' he asked quietly, and smiled at her.

'Because I like going to different countries. I want to meet new people.'

'And why were you with this young man?'

'Because ...' Sarah stopped and looked down at her feet. Nobody could see her face. She began again, very quietly, but nobody could hear her.

'I'm sorry. We can't hear you. Can you say that again, please?'

Sarah looked up. She looked quickly at her mother, and then at Hassan.

'Because I love him.'

Anna felt old and tired. She looked at the tall young man with the beautiful dark eyes. 'It was his heroin,' she thought. 'I'm sure it was. He buys and sells heroin, and he put it in my daughter's bag. And now she says she loves him!'

Stephen sat next to her. He did not move, and he watched Sarah all the time. But she did not look at him.

Mr Cheng waited a minute, and then he questioned Sarah again. 'Did you know about the heroin in those tubes of toothpaste?' he asked.

'No,' Sarah said quickly. 'Of course I didn't!'

'And what about Hassan? Did he know about the heroin? Please think about your answer.'

'No, I'm sure he didn't know. It wasn't our heroin!' Sarah's blue eyes were angry. 'We didn't put the heroin in the toothpaste tubes. We're innocent!'

'Thank you, Miss Harland,' Mr Cheng said quietly, and sat down.

The police lawyer stood up. 'Miss Harland. How much money did you have in your bag?'

'Um ... about fifty pounds, I think.'

'That's not very much. This is an expensive country, you know. How much can you buy ... with your fifty pounds?'

Sarah did not have an answer. 'Um ... I don't know,' she began. 'I usually live very cheaply ...'

'Did you need more money?' The lawyer's questions came quickly now. 'Of course you needed more money. You wanted to sell that heroin. You wanted to be rich. Is that right?'

'No! No! That's not true!'

The lawyer said nothing for a minute. He looked at the jury, and smiled. Then he said, 'Do you think toothpaste is very expensive in this country, Miss Harland?'

'Er ... no, I don't think ... er ... I don't know.'

'Well, I can tell you, it isn't. Toothpaste is cheap here. So why did you bring three tubes of toothpaste with you? How often do you clean your teeth, Miss Harland? Six times a day? Or seven, or eight, times a day, perhaps?'

Sarah looked very unhappy. 'No ... I don't know ... Hassan ...'

'Yes?' the lawyer said quickly. 'Hassan? Are you going to say "Hassan gave it to me"? You love this young man, but you don't want to die. Nobody wants to die. And now you're going to say "It was Hassan's toothpaste". Is that your answer, Miss Harland?'

'No!' Sarah said angrily. 'Of course not! It was my toothpaste. But ...'

'Thank you, Miss Harland.' The police lawyer sat down. 'I have no more questions.'

第三章

第二天早上，安娜·哈兰去了法院。她是第一个到的。她坐在法庭里，等待着。来了很多人，她看到一对夫妇。“他们可能是哈桑的父母。”安娜想。但是她不想和他们说话。

接着，律师也进来了，手里拿着很多文件。他们在她前面的一张桌子前坐下，小声地交谈着。

“这两个律师，”安娜想，“他们是老朋友了。但是其中一个想让我女儿死，另一个却要让她获得自由。”

跟在律师后面进来的是陪审团——一共12个人，有男的，也有女的。他们坐了下来，望着律师。而后他们又看着安娜，小声地议论她。“这些人看起来不是很重要，”安娜想，“但是他们其实是这儿最重要的人。他们要说‘她做了……’或者‘她没做’。然后萨拉要么跟我回家，要么被判死刑。”她认真地端详着他们的脸。

紧接着，一些警察进来了。阿齐兹探长看到了安娜，冲她笑了笑。但是安娜没有和他说话，因为就在此时，萨拉也进来了。她看起来很害怕，脸色苍白。她的眼睛扫过法庭，看到她妈妈时，冲着她苦笑了一下。

萨拉后面跟着两个警察，但是安娜并没有看他们。她注视着萨拉旁边的那个又黑又高的年轻人——哈桑！

“他大概有20岁，”安娜想，“他个子很高，面容英俊，黑色的眼睛也很漂亮。萨拉喜欢她，这我能理解。但是他看起来也很难过，还……有点恐惧。他的手一直在颤抖。”

哈桑看着萨拉，笑了。她也冲着他笑。安娜想和萨拉说话，但就在这时，一个警察大声说：“请全体起立。”所有人都站了起来，法官走进了法庭。他向他的椅子走去，而后坐下。

警方律师先发言。“上个星期，这两个年轻人来到我们国家。”他说，“这个小伙子是本国人，那个女孩是英国人。在机场，警察搜查了他们的包，发现了三管牙膏。就是这些牙膏！”

他看着自己手里举着的三管牙膏，法庭上的每个人也都看到了。

“但它们真是三管牙膏吗？”他问，“不，陪审团的女士们，先生们，它们不是。噢，不是。这里面装的不是牙膏，而是海洛因！是的，海洛因……一种邪恶的、肮脏的毒品，也许是危害最大的毒品。人们因它而丧命。人们称之为‘白色死亡’。”

律师停下来，看着陪审团。他稍微停顿了一会儿。法庭里安静极了。接着，他又开始说了。

“但是为什么，你们问我——为什么这两个年轻人的包里有毒品？我可以告诉你们。因为海洛因也是最贵的毒品之一。在我国，他们卖掉这几管海洛因可以得到大约八万英镑。八万英镑！这钱来得也太容易了！陪审团的女士们，先生们，在我们国家，有很多人——包括一些年轻人，还有在校的学生——吸食这种毒品。开始时，这会令人很兴奋，他们会感到很快乐。但是紧接着，他们就需要越来越多的海洛因，也就需要越来越多的钱来买它。于是，他们离开自己的家庭和亲人。他们吸食更多的海洛因……越来越多。他们无法停止。很快，海洛因就开始要他们的命了。最后，他们就死掉了。这就是‘白色死亡’。这是一种既不迅速也不容易的死亡方式。是的，陪审团的女士们，先生们，许多年轻人和孩子们——你们的孩子和我的孩子，要记住！——都会因这种毒品而致死。”

律师又停下了。陪审团看着他，等待着。

“他真棒，”安娜想，“非常非常棒。他给陪审团讲了一个激动人心的故事，他们欣赏他，但这对萨拉不利。”

律师穿过法庭，站在陪审团前面。“但是，我的朋友们，”他对陪审团说，“在我国，有这么一项法律条文，它也不难理解。当有人把海洛因带到了这个国家时，他们也同时带来了死亡。我们要阻止这些人。那么我们怎样才能阻止他们呢？答案很简单，法律判他们死刑。”

律师回到他的桌前。“现在，请看看站在法庭上的这两个年轻人，”他对陪审团说，“他们把海洛因带进了这个国家。机场警察将把事情的经过告诉你们。请认真听，这个故事不长。记住，法律规定这是死罪。”

警方律师坐下了，机场警察走到法庭的前面。安娜感到不舒服。她看着萨拉。萨拉的脸色苍白，看得出她很害怕。安娜闭上了眼睛。“萨拉，”她想，“噢，萨拉。”

警方律师又站了起来。“请向法庭陈述一下萨拉·哈兰和哈桑的事。”他对机场警察说。

“好的，长官，”这个警察说，“我在这个女孩的包里发现了两管牙膏，在这个小伙子的包里发现了一管。这三支牙膏管里面装的都是海洛因。”

“谢谢。”警方律师坐下了。程先生——萨拉和哈桑的辩护律师——站了起来。

“当你发现海洛因时，萨拉·哈兰怎么说？”他问。

“什么也没说，她就开始哭了，长官。”

“知道了。她害怕吗？”

警察想了一会儿。“我不知道，长官。也许吧，是的，她很害怕。”

“那么你肯定她什么也没说？”

那个警察又想了想。“是这样的，长官。我想她可能说过：‘这不是我的牙膏，全搞错了。’”

“知道了。那个小伙子哈桑呢？他说了什么吗？”

“嗯，长官，他很生气。他说：‘这不是海洛因，这不是真的！是你把它放在这儿的。’”

“我知道了，谢谢你。现在，请告诉我，你为什么要查看这两个年轻人的包呢？你通常不会每个人的包都要查吧？时间不允许的。”

警察又想了想。“嗯，是的，长官。我们不是每个人的包都查。我……这个我恐怕不能告诉您，长官。”

“你说什么？”程先生很生气地问，“你当然可以告诉我！这是法庭！”他看着法官，“这是一个很重要的问题，我们需要一个回答！”

法官看着那个机场警察。“很抱歉，”他说，“请回答这个问题，法庭需要知道答案。”

“好吧，法官大人。是这样的，有一个电话。有人在飞机到达前给我打电话，那人说：‘飞机上有海洛因，由一对青年男女带着。’”

“我明白了，”程先生说，并且笑了，“这很有意思。那么是谁打的电话呢？”

“我不知道，”警察说，“是一个男的，说的是英语。我不知道他的名字。”

*　　*　　*

突然，安娜听到有些响动。她回过头看法庭的门口。一个高个子年轻人走了进来，来到房间的后面。安娜一下子就认出他了。他就是斯蒂芬，萨拉的前任男友。一个警察把他领到安娜旁边的一把椅子旁。他看到了安娜，有那么一瞬间，他显出有点恐惧的样子。但是他接着就笑了笑，在安娜旁边坐下来。

“哈兰太太！”他小声说，“很高兴见到您，您什么时候到的？”

“昨天。”她说，“你怎么迟到了？”

“我找不到法庭，”他回答道。他看起来很忧郁，“告诉我怎样帮助她，”他说，“我想帮助萨拉，但我能做些什么呢？当时我也在飞机上，但是我无能为力。我不想让她死！”

“和我在一起，年轻人，”安娜平静地说，“我们能帮助她——我们一定能！”

*　　*　　*

那天早上的晚些时候，萨拉来到法庭的前面。她的脸色惨白，眼睛哭得红红的。她的辩护律师——程先生——开始问她问题。

“好，哈兰小姐，你为什么要来这个国家？”他平静地问，笑着看着她。

“因为我想去不同的国家，结识新的朋友。”

“那你为什么和这个年轻人在一起？”

“因为……”萨拉停下了，低头盯着自己的脚。谁都看不到她的脸。她又开始说了，但是声音很小，没有人能听见她说些什么。

“很抱歉，我们听不见。请你再说一遍，好吗？”

萨拉抬起头，匆匆地看了母亲一眼，又看着哈桑。

“因为我爱他。”

安娜感到既苍老又疲惫。她看着那个有着一双美丽的黑眼睛的高个子年轻人。“那是他的海洛因。”她想，“我敢肯定那是他的。他买卖海洛因，却把海洛因放在我女儿的包里。而现在她竟然说她爱他！”

斯蒂芬坐在她的旁边。他一动不动，一直望着萨拉。然而她却不看他。

程先生等了一会儿，接着又开始提问萨拉了。“你知道那些牙膏管里装的是海洛因吗？”他问。

“不知道，”萨拉很快地回答说，“我当然不知道！”

“那么哈桑呢？他知道吗？请认真考虑你的回答。

“不，我肯定他不知道。海洛因不是我们的！”萨拉蓝色的眼睛里满是愤怒，“我们没有把海洛因装在牙膏管里，我们是无辜的！”

“谢谢你，哈兰小姐。”程先生平静地说，接着他就坐下了。

警方律师站了起来。“哈兰小姐，你的包里有多少钱？”

“嗯……我想大约50英镑。”

“不是很多。你知道，这个国家物价很高，用你的50英镑……你能买多少东西？”

萨拉有点回答不上来。“嗯……我不知道。”她开始说，“我平常生活很节省，不花很多钱……”

“那你需要更多的钱吗？”律师的问题很快就来了，“你当然需要更多的钱。你想要卖掉海洛因，你想要变得富有。是不是？”

“不，不！不是的！”

律师沉默了一会儿。他看着陪审团，笑了笑。接着他说：“哈兰小姐，你认为牙膏在这个国家很贵吗？”

“呃……不，我想它不贵……呃……我不知道。”

“好吧，我来告诉你，它不贵。牙膏在这儿很便宜。那么你为什么要随身带着三管牙膏呢？哈兰小姐，你多长时间刷一次牙？一天六次？或许是七次、八次？”

萨拉看起来很难过，“不……我不知道……哈桑……”

“哦？”律师很快截住了她的话，“哈桑？你要说‘是哈桑给我的’？你爱这个年轻人，但是你不想死。没人想死。你现在要说‘那是哈桑的牙膏’。哈兰小姐，这是你的回答吗？”

“不是的！”萨拉愤怒地说，“当然不是！那是我的 牙膏。但是……”

“谢谢你，哈兰小姐。”警方律师坐下了，“我问完了。”

Chapter 4

At one o'clock the judge left the court for an hour. Anna Harland talked to Sarah for ten minutes. Sarah cried at first.

'I don't like that police lawyer!' she said. 'Those questions were very difficult. I couldn't answer them.'

'It doesn't matter,' her mother said. 'Your lawyer—Mr Cheng—is very good. And Stephen is here too now. We're all going to help you.'

Sarah was angry. 'Don't talk to me about Stephen!' she said. 'I don't like him. I don't want to see him here!'

'But Sarah—he was your boyfriend for two years! He wants to help you.'

Sarah began to cry again. 'Perhaps he does want to help me. I don't know. But he's different now, mother, you don't understand. His eyes are different. They're ... I don't know. And he can't sit quietly and talk to people now. His Body is moving all the time. He came to see me in our hotel the night before we came to this country, and ... I didn't like him, mother! Why is he here? He doesn't love me now, and I don't love him!'

Anna listened carefully to her daughter, and then she went to see Mr Cheng and Inspector Aziz. Stephen went with her.

'Who made that phone call to the police at the airport?' she asked. 'We need to know that!'

'Yes,' Mr Cheng said. 'That's very important. Can the police tell us?'

'Perhaps,' the Inspector said. 'But it's very difficult. It was not a long telephone call. And the man didn't give his name. Perhaps he was a policeman, and he knew about the heroin.'

'Perhaps,' Mr Cheng said. 'But then, perhaps he put the heroin there. And he wanted the police to find it. Perhaps someone doesn't like your daughter, Mrs Harland?'

'I don't know,' Anna said slowly. 'But perhaps ...'

But then the judge came back into the courtroom, and everybody stopped talking.

The judge then called Hassan. Hassan stood up and went to the front of the courtroom. 'He's a rich boy,' Anna thought. 'That shirt and those shoes are very expensive.'

Hassan stood there, tall and very quiet. He waited for the questions. He did not look afraid. But when Mr Cheng looked at his papers and asked the first question, Hassan closed his eyes.

'Did you know about the heroin in those tubes of toothpaste?'

'No, sir.'

'Did Sarah know?'

'No, sir.'

'Who bought the toothpaste?'

Hassan closed his eyes again for two or three seconds. Then he answered, 'I did, sir.'

'You did? You're sure of that?'

'Yes, sir. I'm sure. I clean my teeth a lot, you see.' Hassan smiled for a moment.

'Well, he does have very white teeth,' Anna thought.

'Sarah ...' Hassan began. Then he stopped.

'Yes?'

Again Hassan closed his eyes and waited for a second. Then he looked at the jury, and said very loudly: 'Sarah did not buy the toothpaste. I bought it. I bought all three tubes of toothpaste. It was my toothpaste.'

Anna sat up in her chair and looked carefully at Hassan. 'That's interesting,' she thought. 'Perhaps he does love Sarah!'

'I see,' Mr Cheng said. 'And when did you first meet Sarah Harland?'

'About two months ago. I was in Australia. We were in the same hotel. She had a ... a difficult time with her boyfriend and I helped her.'

Anna looked at Stephen. He was very angry, and he hit the chair in front of him with his hand.

'I see,' Mr Cheng said again. Then he asked his next question. 'Do you usually carry a lot of money? How much money did you have at the airport?'

'About eighty pounds, I think. That's OK. When I need more money, I get some work for a week or two. We don't need much money.'

'And do you sometimes take heroin?'

'No, sir. Never.'

'Thank you. Stay there, please.'

Mr Cheng sat down and the police lawyer stood up. He smiled at Hassan, but it was not a nice smile.

'Now, Hassan. You bought the toothpaste, but it was in Miss Harland's bag. Why? Why did she carry it for you? Or do you always ask your women to carry things for you?' He smiled.

Hassan said nothing. The lawyer began again. 'You had eighty pounds, you say. But eighty thousand pounds is better than eighty pounds, I think. What do you think?'

'Of course it is. But I don't sell heroin. It's wrong to sell heroin.'

The lawyer moved his papers on the table. He looked at the jury. 'So you are a very good young man with very clean teeth but no money. You met a young English girl. She was unhappy with her boyfriend, so you helped her and took her away with you. Is that right? Oh dear! It's not a very good story, you know. I don't believe it, and I don't think the jury believes it, young man.'

He stopped for a minute. Then he looked at Hassan, and said loudly: 'You don't love Sarah Harland, and she doesn't love you. You went with her because she could help you. And she went with you because she wanted the money. She carried the heroin for you to sell. That's right, isn't it? You put the heroin in the toothpaste tubes, and she knew about it. Is that the true story, young man? I think it is.'

'No! I ...' Hassan began angrily. But the lawyer did not listen. He sat down.

'I have no more questions,' he said to the judge.

第四章

一点钟时，法官离开了法庭一个小时。中间安娜·哈兰和萨拉交谈了10分钟。开始的时候，萨拉哭了。

“我讨厌那个警方律师！”她说，“那些问题很难，我不知道该怎么回答。”

“这没关系，”她妈妈说，“你的律师——程先生——很不错。斯蒂芬现在也在这儿。我们都会帮助你的。”

萨拉很生气。“不要和我谈论斯蒂芬！”她说，“我不喜欢他。我不想在这儿见到他！”

“但是萨拉——他毕竟是你交往了两年的男朋友！他想帮助你。”

萨拉又开始哭了。“或许他真的想帮助我。我不知道。但是他现在和以前不一样了，妈妈，你不明白。他的眼神也不一样。他的眼睛……我不知道。他现在甚至不能安静地坐在那儿和人谈话，他的身体一直动来动去。我们来这个国家的前一天晚上，他到旅馆来看我，还……我不喜欢他，妈妈！他为什么要在这儿？他不爱我了，我也不爱他！”

安娜很认真地听她的女儿说话，然后她去见程先生和阿齐兹探长。斯蒂芬也和她一块儿去了。

“是谁给机场警方打的电话？”她问，“我们需要知道这一点！”

“是的，”程先生说，“这很重要。警方能告诉我们吗？”

“或许可以，”探长说，“但是这很困难，电话通话的时间不长，那人也没留下名字。也许他是个警察，知道海洛因的事。”

“也许吧，”程先生说，“但是，或许是他把海洛因放在了那儿，而且想让警察发现。也许某个人不喜欢您的女儿，哈兰太太？”

“我不知道，”安娜说得很慢，“但有可能……”

但就在这时，法官回到了法庭，人们停止了交谈。

法官接着叫了哈桑。哈桑站了起来，走到法庭的前面。“他是个富家子弟，”安娜想，“衬衣和鞋子都价格不菲。”

哈桑站在那儿，高高的，显得很平静。他在等待提问。他面无惧色，但是当程先生看着文件，提问他第一个问题时，哈桑闭上了眼睛。

“你知道牙膏管里装的是海洛因吗？”

“不知道，先生。”

“萨拉知道吗？”

“她也不知道，先生。”

“谁买的牙膏？”

哈桑又闭上了眼睛。过了两三秒钟，他答道：“我买的，先生。”

“你买的？你肯定？”

“是的，先生，我肯定。您知道，我老刷牙。”哈桑笑了。

“哦，他的牙齿倒确实是挺白的。”安娜想。

“萨拉……”哈桑说，但是他又停下了。

“哦？”

哈桑又闭上了眼睛，过了一小会儿，他睁开眼睛，看着陪审团，大声地说：“萨拉没有买牙膏，是我买的。三管牙膏都是我买的。那是我的 牙膏。”

安娜坐直了身子，仔细端详哈桑。“这倒挺有趣，”她想，“也许他真的爱萨拉！”

“我明白了，”程先生说，“那你第一次见到萨拉是什么时候？”

“大约两个月前。那时我在澳大利亚。我们住在同一个旅馆里。她……和她的男朋友处得不好，我帮助了她。”

安娜看着斯蒂芬。他很生气，用手锤击前面的椅子。

“我明白了，”程先生又说，然后他接着问问题。“你通常在身上带很多钱吗？你在机场时手头有多少钱？”

“我想大约有80英镑。这就够了。当我需要更多的钱时，我会工作上一两个星期。我们不需要很多的钱。”

“那你有时吸食海洛因吗？”

“不，先生，从来没吸过。”

“谢谢你。请待在那儿。”

程先生坐下了，警方的律师站了起来。他冲哈桑笑了笑，但这笑却不和善。

“好，哈桑，你买了牙膏，它们却在哈兰小姐的包里。为什么？为什么要让她替你带着？或者你总是让女士替你拿东西吗？”他笑了。

哈桑哑口无言。律师又开始说了：“你说你有80英镑，但是我觉得拥有8万英镑会更好，你 觉得呢？”

“当然好，但是我不贩卖海洛因，那是错误的。”

律师挪动了一下桌上的文件。他看着陪审团说：“这么说你是一个很不错的年轻人，有着漂亮的牙齿，口袋里却没有钱。你遇到了一个年轻的英国女孩。她与男朋友发生了不愉快，所以你就帮助她，而后把她带走了。是吗？噢，天哪！你知道，这个故事可不怎么样。年轻人，我不相信这个故事，我觉得陪审团也不会相信。”

他停顿了一会儿，然后看着哈桑，大声说：“你不爱萨拉·哈兰，她也不爱你。你和她在一块儿是因为她能帮助你；而她和你在一块儿是因为她想要钱。她为你携带你要贩卖的海洛因。是这样吧，对吗？你把海洛因装在牙膏管里，她是知道的。年轻人，这才是真实的故事吧？我觉得是这样的。”

“不！我……”哈桑很愤怒地说。但是律师不听他的，径直坐下了。

“我没有什么要问的了。”他对法官说。

Chapter 5

The judge looked at his papers and then at the jury. 'It is now four o'clock in the afternoon,' he said. 'We can begin again in the morning. Please be here at ten o'clock.'

The judge stood up and left the courtroom. The jury left too, and the police took Sarah and Hassan back to the prison.

Anna looked at Stephen. 'Well, young man,' she said. 'What can we do now? We have sixteen hours before tomorrow morning.'

'I don't know,' Stephen said. He looked at her for a minute, then he looked away, over her head, at the front of the court. 'I'm sure Hassan knew about the heroin,' he said. 'He put it in her bag, I'm sure he did. Sarah is innocent. But he isn't.'

Mr Cheng came and stood with them.

'She's innocent,' Stephen said again. 'But Hassan's going to die.'

Mr Cheng looked at Stephen carefully. 'Perhaps,' he said slowly. 'But did you listen to Hassan in court? He said: "Sarah did not buy the toothpaste. It was my toothpaste." Now why did he say that? It was not an easy thing to say, you know. What is the jury going to think about it?'

'It doesn't matter,' Stephen said angrily. 'Because it wasn't toothpaste, and he didn't buy it in a shop! He made those tubes, because he wanted to sell the heroin. And he's going to die. That's the law in this country.'

Anna looked at Stephen and said nothing. 'He's very angry,' she thought. 'His face is red and he's talking very quickly. Does he want to kill Hassan? And what's the matter with his eyes?'

Mr Cheng watched Stephen too. 'But who made that telephone call? It's important and I want to know,' he said. 'I'm going to ask the police now. Would you like to come with me, Mrs Harland?'

'Yes, of course,' Anna said. 'Stephen, are you coming?'

'Yes ... er, no, no,' Stephen said. 'I'm going to meet a man. I think he can help us.'

'All right,' Anna said. 'But when can I meet you? I need to talk to you, about Hassan. Can I come to your hotel tonight?'

'Er, no, not tonight,' Stephen said quickly. His face was now white, and he looked tired and ill. His hands and body moved all the time. 'Come to my hotel tomorrow morning. Bye!' He walked quickly out of the courtroom.

Anna and Mr Cheng watched him. Inspector Aziz was near the door, and he watched Stephen, too.

第五章

法官看看他的文件，又看看陪审团。“现在是下午四点，”他说，“我们可以在明天早上重新开庭，请于10点钟到场。”

法官站起来，离开了法庭。陪审团也退庭了。警察把萨拉和哈桑带回监狱。

安娜看着斯蒂芬。“嗯，年轻人，”她说，“我们能做些什么呢？离明天早上重新开庭还有16个小时的时间。”

“我也不知道，”斯蒂芬说。他盯着她看了一会儿，而后把目光挪开，掠过她的头顶，看着法庭的前面。“我敢肯定哈桑知道海洛因的事，”他说，“是他把海洛因放到萨拉的包里的，我肯定是他干的。萨拉是无辜的，但他不是。”

程先生走了过来，和他们站在一起。

“她是无辜的，”斯蒂芬又说，“但是哈桑应该被处死。”

程先生认真地打量着斯蒂芬。“也许吧，”他慢条斯理地说，“但是你听到哈桑在法庭上说的话了吗？他说：‘萨拉没买牙膏，那是我的 牙膏。’那他为什么要这样说呢？你知道，要那么说是很不容易的。陪审团会怎么想呢？”

“这无关紧要，”斯蒂芬愤怒地说，“因为那不是牙膏，他不是在商店买的！而是自己做的，因为他要贩卖海洛因。他要被处死了。这是这个国家的法律。”

安娜看着斯蒂芬，什么也没说。“他很愤怒，”她想，“他的脸涨红，而且讲话速度很快。他想要致哈桑于死地吗？他的眼神怎么了？”

程先生也在观察斯蒂芬。“但是谁打的电话呢？这很重要，我想知道。”他说，“我现在要去问问警察。您想一块儿去吗，哈兰太太？”

“是的，当然，”安娜说，“斯蒂芬，你也来吗？”

“好的……呃，不，不，”斯蒂芬说，“我要去见一个人，我想他能帮我们。”

“好吧，”安娜说，“那我什么时候能见你呢？我要和你谈谈哈桑的事。今天晚上，我去你住的旅馆，行吗？”

“呃，不，今晚不行，”斯蒂芬马上回答道。现在他脸色惨白，看起来疲惫不堪，像是病了。他的手和身体一直都在颤抖。“明天早上来吧！再见。”他飞快地走出了法庭。

安娜和程先生都望着他，阿齐兹探长站在门口，也在看着他。

Chapter 6

Anna and Mr Cheng talked to the police, but the police could tell them nothing more about the telephone call to the airport. Inspector Aziz telephoned two or three people, and then he talked to Anna again. When Anna left Inspector Aziz, she was much happier.

Then she went to the prison to see Sarah. The man took her to Sarah's room. Anna and Sarah sat at the table, and the man stood and watched.

'It was a bad day, mother. I'm sorry,' Sarah said slowly. Her eyes were not red now, but she looked very tired. Her hands were near her mother's, on the table.

'It wasn't a very good day, that's true,' Anna said. 'But you have a very good lawyer, you know. The jury likes him.'

'But it doesn't help,' Sarah said. 'There was heroin in the toothpaste tubes, and the tubes were in my bag. What can Mr Cheng do? The heroin was in my bag, mother! The jury knows that!'

Anna looked at her daughter carefully. 'Perhaps Hassan put it there, Sarah,' she said. 'You like him, I know, and he looks nice, but ...'

'Mother, I love him! I said that in court. You heard me. And Hassan loves me, too! And he does not buy or sell heroin! I ...' Sarah stopped talking, and put her hands on her stomach.

'What's the matter?' Anna asked. She looked at the man. 'Quickly—she's ill. Get a doctor!' The man ran from the room, and Anna put her arms round her daughter. She waited, and then Sarah sat up.

'It's all right, mother,' she said. Her face was very white, but she looked a little better. 'It happens sometimes. I often feel ill, and I don't like to eat much. But it's not very bad. I think I'm going to stay alive because of it.' She gave her mother a smile.

'What? What are you saying? What are you talking about?' Anna cried.

'My baby.' Sarah's face looked different now—half smiling, half afraid. 'Mother, don't be angry, please. I'm going to have a baby. It's Hassan's baby. I ... we wanted to come to England, and tell you about it there, but now we can't. I love him, and he wants to be my husband, mother. Mother? Please don't be angry.'

Anna's face was white now. For nearly a minute she could say nothing. She wanted to cry, but she didn't. At last she said, 'Oh, Sarah! What's going to happen to this baby?'

Sarah looked at her hands. 'Nothing, mother. I asked Mr Cheng about that. They can't kill me, you see, because I'm going to have a baby. They can't kill a mother and her baby. That's the law. But ... that doesn't help Hassan.'

Anna heard a noise and looked at the door. 'Listen, Sarah,' she said quickly. 'Before the doctor comes .... I'm not angry, and I do love you, Sarah, of course. But listen. I talked to Inspector Aziz again today. I think he can help you—and Hassan too. So don't be afraid, please. And ...'

The door opened, and the man came in with a woman doctor. Anna stood up. She took Sarah's hand.

'I'm going now, Sarah. But don't be afraid. You're going to be all right—I'm sure of it!'

第六章

安娜和程先生去找警察了解情况，但是警方也不能给他们提供关于那个机场电话更多的信息。阿齐兹探长给两三个人打了电话后，又开始和安娜交谈。当安娜告别了阿齐兹探长时，她的心里亮堂了许多。

然后，她去监狱里看望萨拉。那个人把她带到萨拉的房间。安娜和萨拉坐在桌前。那人站着，看着她们。

“今天真糟糕，妈妈，对不起。”萨拉慢吞吞地说。她的眼睛现在已经不红了，但是她看起来很疲倦。她的手放在桌子上，离她妈妈的手很近。

“今天的情形不好，这是真的。”安娜说，“但你知道，你有一个很好的律师。陪审团很欣赏他。”

“但这无济于事，”萨拉说，“牙膏管里装有海洛因，而且牙膏又是在我的包里。程先生又能做什么呢？海洛因在我的包里，妈妈！陪审团知道这一点！”

安娜仔细地打量她的女儿。“也许是哈桑放在那儿的，萨拉。”她说，“你喜欢他，这我知道。他长得很帅，但是……”

“妈妈，我爱他！我在法庭上说了。你听到我说了，并且哈桑也爱我！哈桑没有 买卖海洛因！我……”萨拉停了下来，用手捂着肚子。

“怎么回事？”安娜问，她看着那个人，“快点——她病了，找个医生来！”

那人冲了出去，安娜搂着她的女儿。她等待着，然而萨拉坐了起来。

“没事的，妈妈。”她说。她的脸色苍白，但看起来好一些了。“时常会这样，我常常觉得不舒服，不怎么想吃东西。但这倒不算坏，我想，因为它，我还能免于一死呢！”她冲妈妈笑了一下。

“什么？你说什么？你到底在说什么呀？”安娜喊道。

“我的孩子，”现在萨拉的脸色和先前大不一样了——带有几分笑意，还有几分害怕。“妈妈，请别生气。我要有孩子了，是哈桑的孩子。我……我们想回英格兰，在那儿把这事儿告诉你，但现在我们去不成了。我爱他，他也想娶我，妈妈。妈妈？请千万别生气。”

现在安娜的脸白了。将近一分钟，她什么也没说。她想哭，但是没哭出来。最后她说：“噢，萨拉！这个孩子会怎样？”

萨拉看着自己的双手。“孩子没事的，妈妈。我问过程先生的。你知道，他们不能杀我，因为我要有孩子了。他们不能把母亲连同 孩子一块儿杀死。法律是这么规定的。但……这帮不了哈桑。”

安娜听到一些声响，看了看门口。“听我说，萨拉，”她语速很快，“在医生来之前……我没有生气，我真的爱你，萨拉，这一点毫无疑问。但是听着，我今天又和阿齐兹探长谈了，我想他能帮助你——还有哈桑。所以一定别害怕。还有……”

门开了，那人和一个女医生进来了。安娜站了起来，她抓住萨拉的手。

“我要走了，萨拉，但是别害怕。你会没事的——我敢肯定这一点！”

Chapter 7

Next morning, at half past four, Anna Harland stood in a quiet road in front of a hotel. She waited, and then she heard a car behind the hotel. The car doors opened and closed. She waited quietly, and then looked down the road. A man walked into the road and stood next to a shop. He did not look at Anna. But Anna looked at him, and smiled. Then she walked into the hotel.

She went upstairs and knocked on the door of a bedroom. A man answered.

'Who is it?'

'It's me, Stephen,' she said. 'Anna Harland. Open the door, please. I want to talk to you.'

The door opened, and Stephen looked out slowly. 'Anna? What are you doing here at this time? It's ...'

Anna walked quickly into the room. 'Yes. It's half past four. Sarah is in court again at ten o'clock. I need your help, young man. Please get up.'

'But ... what can I do?'

Anna looked at him. 'You went to see a man last night. What happened? Can he help Sarah?'

Stephen answered slowly. He did not look at Anna. 'No. I'm sorry. He can't.'

Anna was cold and angry. 'I see,' she said. 'Well, can you and I help her then? Tell me, Stephen, what do you know about Hassan?'

'Hassan?' Stephen said angrily. 'Well, we met him in Australia, and Sarah went away with him. She doesn't understand him, but I do—he's a rich young man with a beautiful body. He likes playing with girls, but he doesn't love her!'

'And do you love her, Stephen?'

Stephen did not answer at once. For two or three seconds Anna waited. 'He doesn't know,' she thought. 'He can't answer the question.'

'Yes, Mrs Harland. Of course I love her.'

'But he's not looking at me,' Anna thought. 'He's looking out of the window. He's not thinking about Sarah.'

'Stephen,' Anna asked quietly, 'did you go to see Sarah and Hassan in Australia, the night before they came to this country?'

Stephen looked up at her. 'Er ... yes, I went to their hotel,' he said. 'I asked Sarah to leave Hassan and come back to me. But how did you know that?'

'Sarah told me, of course. Was Hassan there?'

'No. He ...' Stephen stopped. Then he said, 'Why do you ask?'

Anna opened her handbag. 'Look at this,' she said. 'What is it? Do you know?'

He looked at it, and then at Anna. 'A tube of toothpaste. Why?'

'That's right. A policeman gave it to me. And he took it from a man. You met that man last night, Stephen. You gave him ten tubes of toothpaste. What was in those tubes of toothpaste, Stephen?'

Stephen said nothing. He looked at the toothpaste, and stood up. But Anna was between him and the door. She gave the toothpaste to him.

'Would you like to clean you teeth, Stephen?'

He began to move to the door, but Anna took his arm. 'You don't love Sarah, do you, Stephen? You hate her, because she left you! You put three of these tubes in Sarah's bag, and then you phoned the police. You told them about the tubes in my daughter's bag ... You want Sarah to die!'

'No!' Stephen said. 'No, no ... not Sarah ... Hassan! I put them in Hassan's bag, not Sarah's. I wanted Hassan to die!'

He opened the door quickly, and then stopped. A man stood there—Inspector Aziz. He put his hand on Stephen's arm.

'It's an old story, young man,' he said. 'It happens every day. My first girlfriend left me for a new man. I was very angry too. I hated him. But I didn't want to kill him. Come on. Let's go. You can tell your story to the judge.'

第七章

第二天早上，四点半，安娜·哈兰站在一家旅馆门前安静的街道上。她等待着，而后听到旅馆后面有汽车的声音。车门开了又关上了。安娜静静地等待着，沿路望着。一个男的走上了这条街道，在一个小店旁站住了。他没有看安娜。但是安娜看着他，笑了。接着，她走进了旅馆。

她上了楼，敲了敲一个房间的门。一个男人应声了。

“谁呀？”

“斯蒂芬，是我。”她说，“我是安娜·哈兰。开门吧，我要和你谈谈。”

门开了，斯蒂芬慢慢地向外张望。“安娜？这个时候，你在这儿干什么？现在是……”

安娜快步走进了房间。“是的，才四点半。萨拉10点钟就又要上法庭了。年轻人，我需要你的帮助，起床吧。”

“但是……我能做什么呢？”

安娜看着他。“你昨天晚上去见了一个人。怎么样？他能帮助萨拉吗？”

斯蒂芬慢条斯理地说：“不能，对不起，他帮不了萨拉。”但他没有看着安娜。

安娜觉得浑身发冷，很生气。“我明白了。”她说，“好吧，那我和你能帮助她吗？告诉我，斯蒂芬，关于哈桑，你知道些什么？”

“哈桑？”斯蒂芬愤怒地说，“是这样的。我们在澳大利亚遇到他，然后萨拉就跟他走了。她不了解他，但我知道——他只是个仪表堂堂的富家子弟。他喜欢玩弄女孩子，但他不爱她！”

“那你爱她吗，斯蒂芬？”

斯蒂芬没有立刻回答。安娜等了两三秒钟。“他不知道，”她想，“他不能回答这个问题。”

“是的，哈兰太太，我当然爱她。”

“但是他没有看着我，”安娜想，“他看着窗外，他不是在想萨拉。”

“斯蒂芬，”安娜平静地问，“萨拉和哈桑来这个国家的前一天晚上还在澳大利亚，你去看他们了吗？”

斯蒂芬抬起头，看着她，“呃……是的，我去了他们住的旅馆。”他说，“我让萨拉离开哈桑，回到我身边。不过，你是怎么知道这件事的？”

“当然是萨拉告诉我的。哈桑在场吗？”

“不，他……”斯蒂芬停住了。接着他说：“你为什么要问这些？”

安娜打开她的手提袋。“看看这个，”她说，“这是什么？你知道吗？”

他看着它，又看看安娜。“一管牙膏，怎么了？”

“没错。这是一个警察给我的，他从一个男的那儿得到的。斯蒂芬，你昨天晚上去见了那个人，你给了他10管牙膏。这些牙膏管里装的是什么，斯蒂芬？”

斯蒂芬哑口无言。他看着牙膏，站了起来。但是安娜挡在了他和门之间。她把牙膏递给他。

“你可以用它刷刷牙吗？斯蒂芬，可以吗？”

他开始向门口走去，但安娜抓住了他的胳膊。“你不爱萨拉，对不对，斯蒂芬？你恨她，因为她离开了你！你把三管这样的牙膏放在她的包里，而后你又给警察打电话，告诉他们我女儿包里的牙膏管……你想要萨拉死！”

“不！”斯蒂芬说，“不，不……不是萨拉……是哈桑！我把牙膏放在了哈桑的包里，而不是萨拉的。我想要哈桑去死！”

他迅速地打开门，却站住了。一个男人站在那儿——阿齐兹探长。他抓住了斯蒂芬的胳膊。

“这是一个老套的故事，年轻人。”他说，“它天天都在上演。我的第一个女朋友为了另一个人离开了我。我也很愤怒。我恨他。但是我并不想杀他。来吧，我们走。你可以把你的故事讲给法官听。”

Chapter 8

At eleven o'clock that morning, Sarah and Hassan were free. Sarah stood with her mother, Inspector Aziz, and Mr Cheng. She smiled happily.

'Mother, you're wonderful! Now I can be happy! But ... how did you know about Stephen?'

Inspector Aziz answered. 'Young woman,' he said. 'Remember, your mother is a doctor. She knew Stephen was ill because of his eyes, and his body. His eyes are very big and dark, and his body is always moving ...'

'Well, yes,' Anna said. 'But you helped me, Sarah. You said he was different—remember? And I looked at him carefully, and began to think. Heroin does that to people.'

'He did a very bad thing,' Sarah said slowly, 'but I feel sorry for him now. When is he going to court, Inspector?'

'I don't know,' the Inspector said. 'In two weeks, perhaps. But don't think about him. Would you like to see our beautiful country, Mrs Harland? Where would you like to go?'

Anna smiled at him. 'Thank you. But I can't stay. Tomorrow, I'm going back to England, to talk to Stephen's mother and father.'

Inspector Aziz looked at her, and said nothing for a minute. Then he said quietly: 'Yes. I feel very sorry for them. It kills a lot of young people, this heroin.'

'Yes. But it isn't going to kill my daughter. She isn't going to die now.' Anna took Sarah's hand. 'So thank you again, Inspector Aziz and Mr Cheng. And goodbye. Now I'm going to have a long cold drink in a quiet garden with my daughter and her new young man. I want to know a lot more about him.'

Hassan stood with his mother and father near the door of the court. Anna Harland put her hand on her daughter's arm, and smiled at them.

remember v. keep or have in the memory. 记住，记着。

第八章

那天上午11点，萨拉和哈桑获释了。萨拉和她的妈妈、阿齐兹探长以及程先生站在一起。她开心地笑了。

“妈妈，你真了不起！我现在可以高高兴兴的啦！但是……你是怎么知道是斯蒂芬的呢？”

阿齐兹探长回答说：“姑娘，”他说，“记住，你妈妈是医生。看到斯蒂芬的眼睛和身体状况，她就知道他有病。他的眼睛很大，但黯淡无光，他的身子还总是在颤抖……”

“哦，是的，”安娜说，“不过，你帮了我，萨拉。你说过，他和以前不一样了——还记得吗？然后我很认真地观察他，开始思考。海洛因会使人变成那样的。”

“他确实干了一件坏事，”萨拉慢慢地说，“但是我现在很同情他。他什么时候上法庭，探长？”

“我不知道，”探长说，“也许两个星期后。不过不要想他了。您愿意看看我们美丽的国家吗，哈兰太太？您想去哪儿？”

安娜冲他笑了笑。“谢谢你。可我不能待在这儿。我明天就回英格兰，把这事跟斯蒂芬的父母谈谈。”

阿齐兹探长看着她，沉默了一会儿。然后他平静地说：“是呀，我为他们感到难过。海洛因毁了很多年轻人。”

“是啊，但是它不会伤害我女儿。现在她不会死了。”安娜拉住萨拉的手，“所以再次谢谢你们，阿齐兹探长，程先生，再见。现在，我要去找一个安静的花园，和我的女儿，还有她的新任男朋友，慢慢地喝冷饮。我要多了解一些他的情况。”

哈桑和他的父母站在法庭门口不远的地方。安娜·哈兰手挽着她的女儿，冲着他们微笑。

THE WIZARD OF OZ

In Kansas, USA, there are no witches or wizards. But there are cyclones, and one day a cyclone blows Dorothy's house, with Dorothy and her dog Toto in it, to a country called Oz. And in Oz there are four witches, and a very famous wizard—the Wizard of Oz.

Dorothy wants to go home to Kansas, but she doesn't know how to get there. She needs help. 'Go to the Emerald City,' the Witch of the North tells her, 'and ask the Wizard of Oz to help you.'

Then Dorothy meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, but they need help too. So they all take the yellow brick road to the Emerald City. But what are they going to find there? Who—or what—is the famous Wizard of Oz?

1

The cyclone

Dorothy lived in a small house in Kansas, with Uncle Henry, Aunt Em, and a little black dog called Toto.

There were no trees and no hills in Kansas, and it was often very windy. Sometimes the wind came very fast and very suddenly. That was a cyclone, and it could blow trees and people and buildings away. There were cellars under all the houses. And when a cyclone came, people went down into their cellars and stayed there.

One day Uncle Henry came out and looked up at the sky. Then he ran quickly back into the house.

'There's a cyclone coming,' he called to Aunt Em and Dorothy. 'We must go down into the cellar!'

They ran to the door of the cellar, but Toto was afraid, and he ran under the bed. Dorothy ran after him.

'Quick!' shouted Aunt Em from the cellar. 'Leave the dog and come down into the cellar!'

Dorothy picked up Toto and ran to the cellar door. But before she got there, the cyclone hit the house.

And then a very strange thing happened.

The house moved, and then it went slowly up, up, up into the sky. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry were down in the cellar under the ground, but the house, Dorothy, and Toto went up to the top of the cyclone. Dorothy looked through the open cellar door and saw hills and houses, a long way down. She closed the cellar door quickly.

The wind blew the house along for many hours. At first Dorothy was afraid.

'But we can't do anything about it,' she said to Toto. 'So let's wait and see.' And after two or three hours, she and Toto went to sleep.

When Dorothy opened her eyes again, the house was on the ground and everything was quiet. She picked up Toto, opened the door, and went out. They saw tall trees and beautiful flowers, and little houses with blue doors.

Dorothy gave a little cry. 'This isn't Kansas, Toto! And who are these people?'

There were three very short men in blue hats, coats and trousers, and a little old woman in a beautiful white dress. The woman walked up to Dorothy and said, 'Thank you, thank you! Now the people are free!'

'Why are you thanking me?' Dorothy asked.

'You killed the Witch of the East,' said the woman. 'She was a bad witch, and her people, the Munchkins, were very afraid of her. Now she is dead, and we and the Munchkins want to thank you.'

The little old woman and the three little men all smiled happily at Dorothy, but Dorothy did not understand.

'But I didn't kill anybody!' she said.

'Your house fell on the Witch,' laughed the little woman. 'Look! You can see her feet!'

Dorothy looked, and saw two feet, with red shoes, under the house. Suddenly, one of the Munchkins gave a shout. 'Look! Her feet are disappearing in the hot sun.'

A second later, there were only the red shoes.

'Good,' said the little woman. She picked up the shoes and gave them to Dorothy. 'They're your shoes now. You must wear them, because a witch's shoes can sometimes do wonderful things.'

'Thank you,' said Dorothy. 'But who are you? Are you a Munchkin?'

'No, but I'm their friend. I'm the Witch of the North, and I came to see the dead Witch of the East. But don't be afraid—I'm a good witch.'

'But Aunt Em says there aren't any witches.'

'Oh yes, there are!' said the Witch. 'Here in the country of Oz we have four witches. The witches of the North and the South are good witches, but those of the East and the West are bad witches. Now the Witch of the East is dead, so there is only one bad witch. We have a famous wizard, too. We call him the Wizard of Oz, and he lives in the Emerald City. How many witches and wizards do you have in your country?'

'We don't have any,' said Dorothy. Suddenly she remembered Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. 'How can I get back home to Kansas?' she asked.

'Where is Kansas?' asked the good Witch. 'I don't know a country called Kansas, so I can't tell you the way.'

Dorothy began to cry. 'Oh dear! What can I do?'

'Please don't cry!' said the Witch. 'Go and see the Wizard of Oz. He's a good wizard, and perhaps he can help you. It's a long way, and you must walk there. I can't go with you, but I can give you my kiss.'

She gave Dorothy a little kiss. It looked like a small red flower on Dorothy's face.

'Now nothing can hurt you,' she said. 'Look—there is the road to the Emerald City. It is made of yellow bricks, so you cannot lose your way... Goodbye.'

'Goodbye!' said the three little Munchkins.

In the house Dorothy found some bread and some apples, and she put them all in a bag. Then she put on her blue and white dress. 'Now I look nice,' she said. She looked down at her old shoes. Then she remembered the bad Witch's red shoes, and put them on.

She picked up her bag of food. 'Come on, Toto!' she called. 'We're going to find the Wizard of Oz.'

1 ．龙卷风

多萝西和她的舅舅亨利、舅妈埃姆以及小黑狗托托住在堪萨斯州的一幢小房子里。

堪萨斯没有树也没有山，却常常刮风。有时候会突然刮起风速极大的风，这就是龙卷风，它能将树木和人甚至房屋卷走，因而每幢房屋都有地下室。当龙卷风刮起时，人们就钻进地下室躲起来。

一天，亨利舅舅走出房子，抬头看了看天空。然后他飞快地跑进屋去。

“龙卷风就要来了，”他冲埃姆舅妈和多萝西喊道，“我们得进地下室！”

他们跑向地下室的门口，可托托受了惊吓，钻到了床底下。于是多萝西追了过去。

“快点儿！”埃姆舅妈在地下室里大喊，“别管狗了，下地下室来！”

多萝西抱起托托，跑向地下室的门口。可还没有跑到跟前，龙卷风就刮来了。

接着，一件非常奇怪的事发生了。

房子开始移动，然后慢慢升高，升高，升高，一直升到了半空中。埃姆舅妈和亨利舅舅在地底下的地下室里，但房子、多萝西和托托却升到了龙卷风的顶端。透过地板上那敞开的地下室门口，多萝西远远地看到了地面上的山峦和房屋，她迅速地关上了地下室的门。

龙卷风卷着房子刮了好几个小时。一开始多萝西很害怕。

“可是我们也无能为力呀，”她对托托说，“我们只有等着瞧了。”两三个钟头过去了，她和托托都睡着了。

当多萝西再次睁开眼睛时，房子已经落在地面上了，四周静悄悄的。她抱起托托，推开房门走了出去。她们看到高大的树木、美丽的花朵以及一些有着蓝色屋门的小房子。

多萝西轻声惊叫：“托托，这儿不是堪萨斯！这些人是谁呀？”

这里有三个非常矮小的男子，穿着蓝色的外套和裤子，戴着蓝帽子。还有一个矮小的老婆婆，穿着漂亮的白色衣裙。老婆婆向多萝西走来，对她说：“谢谢你，谢谢！现在我们的人民自由了。”

“你为什么要感谢我呢？”多萝西问道。

“因为你杀死了东方女巫，”老婆婆回答，“她是个坏巫婆，而她的人民——芒奇金人——以前都很怕她。现在她死了，我们和芒奇金人都要感谢你。”

矮小的老婆婆和三个小矮人一起朝多萝西快乐地微笑着，可多萝西还是不明白。

“我可没有杀任何人！”她说。

“你的房子落在了那巫婆身上，”老婆婆大笑起来，“瞧！你还能看见她的两只脚呢！”

多萝西看见了房子下面两只穿着红鞋的脚。突然，一个芒奇金人大叫起来：“看呐！她的脚在烈日下正慢慢消失。”

一眨眼的工夫，地上只剩下红鞋子了。

“很好，”老婆婆说。她拾起鞋子，把它们递给多萝西，说：“从现在起，这就是你的了。你必须穿着它们，因为一双女巫的鞋子有时会做出神奇的事来。”

“谢谢，”多萝西说，“可你是谁？是芒奇金人吗？”

“不，但我是他们的朋友。我是北方女巫，到这儿来看东方女巫的尸体。别害怕，我是个好巫婆。”

“可埃姆舅妈说世上没有巫婆。”

“哦，不！有巫婆。”女巫说，“在奥兹国共有四个女巫，其中南方和北方的女巫是好的，而东方和西方的女巫是坏的。现在东方女巫已死，所以就剩下一个坏巫婆了。这里还有一个著名的魔法师，我们叫他奥兹魔法师，他住在绿宝石城。你们那里有多少巫婆和魔法师？”

“我们那儿可没有，”多萝西回答。她忽然想起了埃姆舅妈和亨利舅舅。“我怎样才能返回堪萨斯呢？”她问。

“堪萨斯是什么地方？”好心的巫婆问她，“我从不知道一个叫堪萨斯的国家，因此我没法给你指路。”

多萝西哭了起来，“天哪，我该怎么办？”

“别哭，”女巫说，“去见奥兹魔法师吧，他是个好法师，或许能帮你。路途遥远，但你必须走着去。我不能陪你去，不过我可以给你一个吻。”

她轻轻吻了多萝西一下，那个吻就像贴在多萝西脸颊上的一朵小红花。

“从现在起没有什么能伤害你了，”女巫说，“看，这就是通向绿宝石城的路。它是用黄砖铺成的，所以你不会迷路……再见。”

“再见了！”三个矮小的芒奇金人齐声说。

多萝西在房子里找到了一些面包和几个苹果，她把它们装进了一个包里。然后她换上了她那条蓝白花色的裙子。“现在我可漂亮了。”她自言自语道。看了看自己的旧鞋子，她想起坏女巫的那双红鞋，于是就换上了。

她拿起装食物的包。“走，托托！”她喊道，“我们去找奥兹魔法师。”

The yellow brick road

Dorothy and Toto walked along the yellow brick road for a long time. When they were tired, they stopped in a field by the road. Not far away, there was a scarecrow, and Dorothy and Toto walked across to look at it.

'Good day,' said the Scarecrow.

'Oh!' said Dorothy. 'You can speak!'

'Of course I can speak,' said the Scarecrow. 'But I can't move, up here on this pole... I'd like to get down. Can you help me?'

Carefully, Dorothy took the Scarecrow off his pole.

'Thank you very much,' said the Scarecrow. He moved his arms and legs, and straw went everywhere. 'Who are you?' he asked. 'And where are you going?'

'I'm Dorothy, and I'm going to the Emerald City. I want to go home to Kansas, but I don't know the way. I'm going to ask the Wizard of Oz for help.'

'Where is the Emerald City?' asked the Scarecrow. 'And who is the Wizard of Oz? I don't know anything, you see, because I have no brains in my head—only straw.'

'Oh dear!' said Dorothy. 'I'm very sorry.'

'I would very much like to have some brains,' the Scarecrow said. 'Can I go to the Emerald City with you? Perhaps the Wizard of Oz can give me some brains. What do you think?'

'I don't know,' said Dorothy. 'But yes, please come with me. He's a famous wizard, so perhaps he can help you.' She felt very sorry for the Scarecrow. 'Don't be afraid of Toto,' she said. 'He never hurts people.'

'Nothing can hurt me,' said the Scarecrow. 'I'm not afraid of anything... Well, that's not true. I am afraid of fire, of course.'

Dorothy walked along the road with her new friend. Soon she began to feel hungry, so she sat down and she and Toto ate some bread and apples. 'Would you like some, Scarecrow?' said Dorothy.

'No, thank you,' said the Scarecrow. 'I don't need to eat or drink. You can't eat when you're made of straw... Now, tell me about your home.'

So Dorothy told him about Kansas, and Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, and the cyclone.

'But why do you want to leave this beautiful country?' asked the Scarecrow. 'Kansas, you say, has no trees, no green hills, no gardens. I don't understand.'

'That's because you have no brains,' said Dorothy. 'Kansas is my home. We say, "East, west—home's best", and it's true. I want to go home.'

They walked along the road for some hours, and then it got dark. Dorothy was tired, and soon the Scarecrow saw a little house behind some trees. There was nobody there, so they went in. Dorothy and Toto slept, but the Scarecrow just stood all night with his eyes open.

'Scarecrows don't sleep,' he said.

*　　*　　*

In the morning Dorothy looked for water.

'Why do you want water?' asked the Scarecrow.

'Toto and I are thirsty. And I need to wash.'

'I'm sorry for you,' said the Scarecrow. 'You need a lot of things! But you have brains, and you can think, and that's wonderful.'

They found some water, and Dorothy washed. Then she and Toto ate some bread. Suddenly, they heard a shout from the trees near the house, and they all ran out of the house to look.

They saw a man by a big tree, with an axe in his hand. He was made of tin. He stood very still and shouted 'Help!' again and again.

'What can I do for you?' asked Dorothy.

'I can't move,' said the Tin Man. 'Please oil me. There's an oil-can in my house.'

At once Dorothy ran back to the house and found the oil-can. Then she came back and, with the Scarecrow's help, she carefully oiled the Tin Man. Slowly, he began to move, first his head, and then his arms and legs.

'Thank you,' he said. 'I feel better now.' He put down his axe. 'I went out in the rain, you see, and water is very bad for a tin body. I was there for a long time, and nobody came to help me.'

'We stopped at your house for the night,' Dorothy said, 'and we heard your shout this morning.'

'Where are you going?' asked the Tin Man.

So Dorothy told him about the Wizard of Oz. 'I want to go back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants some brains,' she said.

The Tin Man was very interested. 'Can the Wizard give me a heart, do you think? I have no heart, so I can't love, or feel... I would very much like to have a heart.'

'Come with us,' said the Scarecrow.

'Yes,' said Dorothy. 'And then you can ask the Wizard for help, too.'

So they all walked along the yellow brick road. There were many tall trees next to the road, and sometimes the three friends heard noises from animals behind the trees. Dorothy did not like these noises very much.

'How far is it to the Emerald City?' she asked the Tin Man. 'Do you know?'

'It's a long way, I think,' said the Tin Man. 'And we must be careful because—'

But just then a big lion suddenly ran out from the trees, into the road. It opened its mouth—it had long yellow teeth—and began to run after Toto.

Dorothy was afraid for Toto. She ran up to the lion and hit it on the nose with her bag. 'Don't hurt my dog!' she cried angrily. 'He's smaller than you!'

'I didn't hurt him,' said the Lion. 'Don't hit me again— please!'

'Why—you're afraid!' said Dorothy. 'Be quiet, Toto, he isn't going to hurt you. He's more afraid than you are. He's just a big coward.'

'It's true,' said the Lion. 'I am a coward. Everyone thinks lions are brave. I make a lot of noise, but I'm not brave. I'm just a coward.' And the Cowardly Lion began to cry.

Then Dorothy told him about the Wizard of Oz. 'Come with us to the Emerald City,' she said. 'I want to go back to Kansas, the Scarecrow wants some brains, and the Tin Man wants a heart. Perhaps the Wizard of Oz can make you brave.'

'Oh, thank you!' said the Lion. 'I would very much like to be brave.'

And so the Cowardly Lion came with them. At first Toto was afraid of him, but very soon he and the Lion were good friends.

That night Dorothy and Toto slept under a big tree, next to the Cowardly Lion's big, warm body. In the morning they ate the last of their bread.

'Oh dear!' said Dorothy. 'What are we going to eat for dinner?'

'I can kill an animal for you,' said the Cowardly Lion.

'Oh no—please don't kill anything!' the Tin Man said. He began to cry. 'We don't want to hurt any animals. I haven't got a heart, but I feel sorry for them.'

Dorothy quickly got out the oil-can and oiled his face.

'Don't cry,' she said. 'You know water is bad for you.'

They walked along the yellow road, and after an hour or two they came to a big river.

'Oh no!' said Dorothy. 'How can we get across?'

The Lion looked down at the river. 'I'm very afraid of falling,' he said, 'but I think I can jump across.'

'Good!' said the Scarecrow at once. 'You can carry us on your back, one at a time.'

So the Cowardly Lion jumped across the river, first with the Scarecrow on his back, then with Dorothy and Toto, and last with the Tin Man.

But soon they came to a second river. This one was very big, and the Lion could not jump across it. The Scarecrow thought for a minute.

'Look,' he said. 'There's a tall tree next to the river. The Tin Man can cut it down with his axe. And when the tree falls across the river, we can walk across the tree.'

'Very good,' said the Lion. 'For somebody with straw in their head, and not brains.'

So the Tin Man cut down the tree with his axe, and soon they were all across that river, too.

2 ．黄砖路

多萝西和托托沿着黄砖路走了很久。累了，她们便停在路边的一片稻田里。不远处有一个稻草人。多萝西和托托穿过田地去看他。

“你好啊。”稻草人说。

“哦！”多萝西惊叫，“你居然会说话！”

“我当然会说话了，”稻草人回答道，“不过我不会动，只能待在这根杆上……我想下来。你能帮我一下吗？”

多萝西小心翼翼地将稻草人从杆上取下来。

“非常感谢，”稻草人说。他动动胳膊，又动动腿，稻草掉了一地。“你是谁？”他问道，“到哪里去？”

“我是多萝西，要去绿宝石城。我想回家乡堪萨斯，但不知该怎么走，所以我得去找奥兹魔法师帮忙。”

“绿宝石城在哪里？”稻草人问，“奥兹魔法师又是谁？你瞧，我什么都不知道，因为我的脑袋里没有大脑——只有稻草。”

“哦，天哪！”多萝西回答，“太遗憾了。”

“我很想长点脑子，”稻草人说，“我能和你一起去绿宝石城吗？或许奥兹魔法师能给我点脑子。你觉得怎么样？”

“我也不知道。”多萝西回答道，“好的，你和我们一起去吧。他是个伟大的魔法师，或许可以帮你。”她十分同情稻草人。“别怕托托，”她说，“它从不伤人。”

“没人可以伤害我，”稻草人说，“我什么也不怕……嗯，不对，当然我是 怕火的。”

多萝西和她的新朋友沿着路走，没过多久她就感到饿了。她坐下来，和托托一起吃了些面包和苹果。“稻草人，你想吃点吗？”多萝西问。

“不了，谢谢，”稻草人回答，“我既不需要吃也不需要喝。如果你是稻草做的，你也不用吃东西……现在，给我讲讲你的家吧。”

于是，多萝西就给他讲起了堪萨斯，讲起了亨利舅舅和埃姆舅妈，讲起了龙卷风。

“那你为什么还要离开这个美丽的国度呢？”稻草人问她，“你说了，堪萨斯没有树木，没有青山，没有花园。我不明白。”

“问这个问题说明你没有脑子。”多萝西说，“堪萨斯是我的家乡呀，我们常说：‘无论身在何方——家是最好的地方。’的确是这样的，我就是想回家。”

他们又沿着路走了几个小时。天色渐黑，多萝西累了，很快稻草人看见树丛后有一幢小屋。屋里没人，他们就进去了。多萝西和托托睡觉了，而稻草人却睁着眼站了一夜。

“稻草人才不睡觉呢。”他说。

*　　*　　*

早上，多萝西找水喝。

“你为什么要喝水？”稻草人问她。

“我和托托都渴了。我还需要洗脸。”

“我真同情你。”稻草人说，“你有这么多的需要！但你 有大脑，你 还能思考，真好！”

他们找到一些水。多萝西洗漱完毕，和托托一起吃了些面包。突然，屋旁的树林里传来一声叫喊，于是他们都从屋里跑出去看。

他们看见一个锡做的人，手持一把斧头，站在一棵大树边。他一动不动，一遍又一遍地喊“救命”。

“我怎么帮你呢？”多萝西问。

“我动不了了，”锡人回答，“请给我上点油，我的屋里有油罐。”

多萝西立刻跑进房里，找到了油罐。然后她又跑回来，在稻草人的帮助下仔仔细细地给锡人加上油。慢慢地，锡人开始动了，先是头，接着是胳膊和腿。

“谢谢你，”锡人说，“现在我感觉好多了。”他放下斧子。“我在下雨时出来了，瞧，水对一个锡做的身体是非常有害的。我已经在那儿待了很久了，却没人来帮我。”

“我们在你的屋里过夜了，”多萝西说，“早上听见了你的叫声。”

“你们去哪儿？”锡人问。

于是，多萝西给他讲了奥兹魔法师的事。“我想回堪萨斯，而稻草人想要大脑。”她说。

锡人很感兴趣。“魔法师能给我一颗心吗？我没有心，所以我不能去爱或感觉……我非常想要一颗心。”

“跟我们走吧。”稻草人说。

“对，”多萝西说，“你也可以让奥兹魔法师帮你。”

就这样，他们一起沿着黄砖铺成的路往前走。路两旁有许多高大的树木，有时他们三人会听见树林里传来的动物的叫声。多萝西并不想听见这些声音。

“我们离绿宝石城还有多远？”她问锡人，“你知道吗？”

“我想，还很远呢。”锡人说，“而且我们必须小心点儿，因为——”

正在那时，一只巨大的狮子突然从树林里跑出来，跑到了路上。它张着嘴——露出一嘴黄黄的长牙齿——然后开始追托托。

多萝西担心托托，于是她冲向狮子，用她的包砸狮子的鼻子。“不许伤害我的狗！”她生气地大喊，“它比你个头小！”

“我没有伤害它，”狮子说，“别打我——求你了！”

“什么——你居然害怕了！”多萝西说，“安静，托托，他不会伤害你的。他比你更害怕。他只不过是一个身体巨大的胆小鬼。”

“说得对，”狮子说，“我是 个胆小鬼。人人都以为狮子勇敢，虽然我经常叫嚣，但我并不勇敢。我只是个懦夫。”接着，胆小鬼狮子哭了起来。

多萝西告诉他有关奥兹魔法师的事。“和我们一起去绿宝石城吧。”她说，“我想回堪萨斯，稻草人想要大脑，锡人想要颗心。也许奥兹魔法师会让你勇敢起来。”

“哦，谢谢你！”狮子说，“我真的很想变得勇敢起来。”

这样，胆小鬼狮子就和他们一起上路了。一开始，托托还害怕他，但很快就和他成了好朋友。

当晚，多萝西和托托挨着胆小鬼狮子庞大、温暖的身体，睡在了一棵大树下。第二天早上，她们吃光了剩下的面包。

“哦，天呀！”多萝西说，“我们晚饭吃什么呢？”

“我能为你杀个动物。”胆小鬼狮子说。

“喔，不——别杀任何东西！”锡人说着，哭了起来，“我们不想伤害任何动物。虽然我没有心，但我同情它们。”

多萝西急忙取出油罐，给他的脸上涂上油。

“别哭了，”她说，“你知道水对你伤害大。”

他们顺着黄色的路走了一两个小时后，来到了一条大河前。

“哦，不！”多萝西说，“我们可怎么过去呢？”

狮子低头望了望河水。“虽然我很怕掉下去，”他说，“可我想我是可以跳过去的。”

“好啊！”稻草人马上说道，“你可以一个一个地驮我们过河。”

第一次，胆小鬼狮子驮稻草人跳过河去，接着是多萝西和托托，最后是锡人。

但不久他们又遇到了第二条河。这条河太宽了，狮子跳不过去。稻草人想了一下。

“看！”他说，“河边有一棵大树。锡人可以用斧子将它砍倒。树倒在河上，我们就能踩着树过河了。”

“太好了，”狮子说，“一个满脑袋稻草却没有大脑的人能想出这样一条妙计，真是太好了。”

于是锡人用斧子砍倒了树，很快他们都过了河。

The Emerald City

It was a long day. The yellow brick road went past fields and through trees, up hills and down hills. In the evening they began to see small green houses by the road. Sometimes little people in green clothes came out and looked at the friends. But they did not come near them, because they were afraid of the Cowardly Lion.

'Everything here is green. Perhaps we're near the Emerald City,' said Dorothy. 'Toto and I are hungry. Let's stop at the next house.'

A little woman opened the door, and Dorothy said, 'Please can we stay the night in your house?' The little woman looked at the Lion, and Dorothy said quickly, 'The Lion is my friend, and he never hurts anybody.'

'All right,' the little woman said. 'You can all come in.'

She put a wonderful dinner on the table. Dorothy and Toto ate a lot of it, and the Lion ate some of it. But the Scarecrow and the Tin Man ate nothing.

'Where are you all going?' asked the little woman.

'To the Emerald City,' said Dorothy. 'We want to see the Wizard of Oz.'

'That's not easy,' said the woman. 'The Wizard never goes out of his house, and nobody sees his face.'

'Is the Wizard a man?' asked the Scarecrow.

'Nobody knows,' said the woman. 'He's a wizard, so he can be a man, or an animal—or anything!'

'How strange!' said Dorothy. 'But we need his help, so we must see him.'

The next day they thanked the woman, left the house, and began walking again. Soon they saw a beautiful city in front of them—it was the Emerald City at last.

The friends went up the yellow brick road to a big green door, and stopped. Slowly, the door opened, and a little man in green clothes stood there.

'We want to see the Wizard, please,' said Dorothy.

'Nobody sees the Wizard,' he said. 'He is a very good and very famous Wizard, but nobody can see him.'

'We must see him,' said Dorothy. 'Please ask him.'

'All right,' said the green man. 'I can take you to his house. But first, you must all put glasses on.' He opened a big box. In it were lots of glasses. 'You must wear your glasses all the time,' he said. 'Everybody in the city must wear glasses. The Wizard says this.'

So they all put on glasses. The green man put on some glasses too, and then he took them through the Emerald City. Everything in the city was green—men, women, children, houses, shops, streets...

The green man took them to a very big house, and they went into a long green room. 'Wait here,' he said. After a short time he came back.

'You can see the Wizard,' he said. 'But you must go to him one by one. He wants to see the little girl first.'

Then he went away, and a green girl came in. She took Dorothy to a tall green door.

'The Wizard is in there,' said the green girl. 'He's waiting for you.' Dorothy went in. On a green chair was a very, very big head. There was no body, or arms, or legs—only a head. Its mouth opened and the Head said: 'I am Oz. Who are you, and what do you want?'

'I am Dorothy,' said the child bravely.

'Where did you get those red shoes?'

'From the bad Witch of the East,' said Dorothy. 'My house fell on her and killed her.'

'What is that thing on your face?'

'A kiss. The good Witch of the North kissed me,' said Dorothy. 'I need help, and she told me about you.'

'And what do you want?'

'I want to go home to Kansas,' answered Dorothy, 'but I don't know the way. Please help me to get home.'

The big eyes opened and closed, opened and closed. Then the mouth opened and the Head spoke again. 'Well,' it said. 'Perhaps I can help you. But first, you must do something for me .'

'What do you want me to do?' asked Dorothy.

'Kill the bad Witch of the West.'

'But I don't want to kill anybody!' said Dorothy.

'You killed her sister. And you are wearing her shoes. Go now, and kill the Witch of the West.'

The little girl began to cry. 'But how can I kill the Witch?' she said. The big eyes opened and looked at her, but the Head did not answer. Dorothy went away, and then her friends went into the Wizard's room—first the Scarecrow, then the Tin Man, and last the Lion.

Later, they all met in the long green room and talked. Dorothy told her friends about the Head.

'That's interesting,' said the Scarecrow. 'I didn't see a Head; I saw a beautiful woman. I asked her for some brains and she said, "Yes, but first you must help Dorothy to kill the Witch of the West." '

'I saw a big animal with two heads,' said the Tin Man. 'I asked for a heart. The animal said, "I can give you a heart; but first you must help Dorothy to kill the Witch of the West." What did you see, Lion?'

'I saw a ball of fire,' said the Cowardly Lion. 'I said, "I'm a coward; please make me brave." And the fire said, "When the Witch of the West is dead, I can help you. But not before." I was angry then,' said the Lion, 'but the ball of fire got bigger and bigger, so I ran away.'

'Oh, what are we going to do?' said Dorothy.

'Well,' said the Scarecrow. 'We must find the Witch of the West, and then we must kill her.'

3 ．绿宝石城

又过了漫长的一天。他们沿着黄砖铺的路穿越田地树林，翻山越岭。走到傍晚，他们看见路边渐渐地有了一些绿色的小房子。有时会有身着绿衣的小矮人走出房子来，好奇地打量他们几个，但是这些小人儿从不靠近他们，因为他们害怕胆小鬼狮子。

“这里的一切都是绿色的，我们可能离绿宝石城不远了。”多萝西说，“我和托托饿了，到了下一个房子我们就停一下吧。”

一个矮小的妇人打开了房门，多萝西对她说：“请问，我们能在您这儿过一夜吗？”小妇人望着狮子，于是多萝西连忙说：“这狮子是我的朋友，他从不伤人。”

“好的。”小妇人回答道，“请进来吧。”

她准备了一桌丰盛的晚餐。多萝西和托托吃了许多，狮子吃了一些，而稻草人和锡人却什么也没吃。

“你们要去哪儿？”小妇人问。

“去绿宝石城，”多萝西回答，“我们想见奥兹魔法师。”

“那可不容易。”小妇人说，“魔法师从不离开他的房子，也没人见过他的脸。”

“魔法师是人吗？”稻草人问。

“没人知道，”小妇人说，“他是魔法师，所以他可以是人，也可以是动物或其他什么东西。”

“多奇怪啊！”多萝西感叹道，“可我们需要他的帮助，因而我们必须 见他。”

第二天，他们谢过小妇人，离开她家继续赶路。很快一座美丽的城市出现在他们面前——他们终于到达绿宝石城了。

他们沿着黄砖路走到一扇绿色大门前停了下来。缓缓地，大门开了，一个身着绿衣绿裤的小矮人站在门内。

“我们求见魔法师。”多萝西说。

“没人见过魔法师。”他回答，“他是一位很好、很有名的法师，但没有人见过他。”

“我们必须 见他，”多萝西说，“请转告他。”

“好吧，”绿衣人回答，“我可以带你们去他的房子里，不过，你们首先得戴上眼镜。”他打开一个大匣子，里面装着许多眼镜。“你们得一直戴着眼镜，”他说，“魔法师说过，这个城里的人都必须戴眼镜。”

这样，他们就戴上了眼镜。绿衣人也戴了副眼镜。他领他们在绿宝石城里穿行。城中一切都是绿色的——绿色的男女老少，绿色的房屋、店铺、街道……

绿衣人把他们领到一幢高大的绿房子里，进了一间长长的绿屋子。“你们在这儿等一下。”他说。过了一会儿，他回来了。

“你们可以见魔法师，”他说，“但必须一个一个地见他。他想先见这个小女孩。”

说完他就离开了，又进来了一个绿衣姑娘。她将多萝西领到一扇高大的绿门前。

“魔法师就在这里，”绿衣姑娘说，“他在等你。”

多萝西走进去。只见一把绿椅子上有一个非常非常大的脑袋。没有身体，没有胳膊和腿——只有一个脑袋。它张开了嘴，脑袋开始说话了：“我就是奥兹，你是谁？你想要什么？”

“我叫多萝西。”小女孩勇敢地回答。

“你是从哪儿弄到那双红鞋的？”

“从邪恶的东方女巫那里。”多萝西回答，“我的房子落在了她身上，压死了她。”

“你的脸上是什么？”

“一个吻。善良的北方女巫吻了我一下。”多萝西回答说，“我需要帮助，是她让我来找你的。”

“你需要什么帮助？”

“我想回我的家乡堪萨斯，”多萝西回答，“但不知道怎么走。请帮我重返家园。”

脑袋上巨大的眼睛张开又闭上，张开又闭上。“噢，”它接着说，“或许我能够帮你，但首先你 得为我 做点儿事。”

“你想让我做什么呢？”多萝西问。

“杀死邪恶的西方女巫。”

“我可不想杀人！”多萝西说。

“可你杀了她的姐姐，还穿着她的鞋子。去吧，杀掉西方女巫。”

小女孩哭了起来。“但是我怎么杀得了那个巫婆呢？”她说。巨大的眼睛睁开了，望着她，可没有做声。多萝西离开了。她的朋友们先后进了魔法师的房间——先是稻草人，然后是锡人，最后是狮子。

其后，他们在长长的绿房子里碰头，交谈起来。多萝西向她的朋友讲了那个脑袋。

“真有意思，”稻草人说，“我没看见什么脑袋，只见到了一个漂亮的女人。我请她赐予我一些头脑，她说：‘好，但首先你得帮多萝西杀掉西方女巫。’”

“我见到的是一个长了两个脑袋的动物。”锡人说，“我请它给我一颗心。那动物说：‘我可以给你一颗心，但首先你必须帮多萝西杀掉西方女巫。’狮子，你见到的是什么？”

“我见到的是一团火，”胆小鬼狮子说，“我对它说：‘我是个懦夫，请让我变成勇敢者。’那团火说：‘只有西方女巫死了，我才能帮你。现在不行。’我听了很生气。”狮子说，“但那团火变得越来越大，我便逃了出来。”

“哦，那我们现在怎么办？”多萝西问。

“嗯，”稻草人说，“我们必须先找到西方女巫，然后杀死她。”

The witch and the monkeys

The next morning they left the Emerald City. The green man took away their glasses and told them the way to the Witch's house. 'Everybody is afraid of the Witch of the West,' he said. 'So be careful!'

The friends walked for a long time. The road was bad, and there were no houses, no fields, no trees.

Now the Witch of the West had a magic eye, and it could see everything. She saw the friends on the road, and she was angry. She put on her tall black hat and shouted, 'Magic Monkeys—come!'

In a second forty monkeys arrived at her tall house. 'What do you want?' they asked.

'There are three people, a dog, and a lion on my road,' she said. 'Kill the people and the dog. But bring the lion here to my house. He can work for me.'

'At once,' said the Monkeys. And away they went.

They broke the Tin Man's arms and legs. They took all the straw out of the Scarecrow and threw his clothes up into a tall tree. Then they took the Lion and carried him to a dark cellar under the Witch's house.

But they could not hurt Dorothy and Toto, because of the good Witch's kiss. So the Monkeys picked them up very carefully and carried them to the Witch's house. The Witch saw the kiss on Dorothy's face, and was afraid. But she did not tell Dorothy that.

'You must work for me in my house now,' she said to the child. 'All day, and every day. And remember—I am watching you all the time.'

Now Dorothy did not know this, but the red shoes were magic. The Witch wanted those shoes very much, but Dorothy never took them off. She took them off when she washed, of course, but the Witch never went near water. She was very, very afraid of water.

Then, one morning, Dorothy's left shoe fell off.

The Witch picked up the shoe at once. 'This is my shoe now!' she shouted.

'No, it isn't!' shouted Dorothy angrily. 'Give it back to me at once!'

'No!' said the Witch. And then she tried to take Dorothy's right shoe too.

Dorothy loved her red shoes, and she was very angry. There was a bucket of water near the door. Dorothy picked up the bucket and threw the water at the Witch. The water hit her in the face, and she cried out, 'Help! Help! The water is killing me! The—water—is...'

And then she disappeared! There was only her tall black hat and a long black dress.

Dorothy looked and looked, but the Witch was not there. Dorothy picked up her red shoe and put it on.

'Now, how can I help my friends?' she said. 'Can I call the Magic Monkeys?' She picked up the Witch's black hat and looked at it. 'Perhaps I must wear this magic hat when I speak.' So she put the hat on and called, 'Magic Monkeys—come!'

The Monkeys arrived in a second.

'Please can you help my friends?' asked Dorothy.

'Of course,' said the Monkeys. 'We must always help the wearer of the magic black hat.'

They broke open the dark cellar, and the Cowardly Lion came out. 'Free at last!' he said. 'Thank you!'

Then the Monkeys found the Scarecrow's clothes and put some new straw in them. The Scarecrow laughed and jumped. 'Thank you!' he said.

Next the Monkeys mended the Tin Man and gave him a new oil-can. He moved his arms and legs. 'I feel wonderful!' he said. 'Thank you!'

Dorothy told her friends about the Witch and the water, and they were all very happy. Toto could not speak, but he jumped up and down very happily.

'Now,' said Dorothy, 'we must go back to the Wizard of Oz. Magic Monkeys—take us to the Emerald City!'

4 ．女巫和魔猴

第二天早上，他们离开了绿宝石城。绿衣人拿走了他们戴的眼镜，给他们指了去女巫那儿的路。“没有人不怕西方女巫，”他说，“小心啊！”

他们又走了很久。路变得崎岖了，两侧也没有房舍、田地和树木了。

西方女巫有一只神眼，可以看见一切。她看到多萝西他们走在路上，非常生气。她戴上高高的黑帽子，大声喝道：“魔猴，来呀！”

刹那间，40只猴子来到了她高大的房子里。“您有何吩咐？”它们问。

“有三个人、一只狗和一头狮子在我的路上走，”她说，“杀了人和狗。把狮子带到这儿来，他能为我干活。”

“遵命。”猴子们说。然后它们就走了。

它们折断了锡人的胳膊和腿，掏出了稻草人的稻草并把他的衣服扔在一棵高高的树上。然后它们抓住了狮子，把它弄到巫婆房子阴暗的地窖里。

但好女巫的吻使它们无法伤害多萝西和托托，因而猴子们非常小心地抓住她们，把她们带到巫婆的住处。巫婆看到多萝西脸上的唇印，害怕了，但她没有让多萝西知道。

“从现在起，你要待在这房子里为我干活，”她对女孩说，“从早到晚，日复一日。记住——我一直在监视你。”

红鞋子有魔力，可现在多萝西还不知道。巫婆很想要这鞋，但多萝西从不脱下它们。当然，她会在洗脚时把鞋脱掉，但巫婆从不靠近水，因为她非常非常怕水。

一天早上，多萝西左脚的鞋掉了。

巫婆立即捡了起来，大叫：“从现在起这鞋是我的 了！”

“不是的！”多萝西生气地喊道，“马上还给我！”

“不！”巫婆喊道。她还试图抢夺多萝西右脚上的鞋。

多萝西喜欢她的红鞋子，因而她很生气。门边恰好有一桶水，于是她提起桶，把水泼向巫婆。水泼在了她的脸上，她大叫：“救命啊！救命！水会杀了我的！水——会……”

接着她就消失了！地上只剩下她高高的黑帽子和黑色的长袍。

多萝西看看这儿，又看看那儿，就是不见巫婆的踪影。多萝西捡起她的红鞋子，把它们穿上。

“现在该怎么解救我的朋友们呢？”多萝西自言自语道，“我能召唤魔猴吗？”她拿起巫婆的黑帽子端详了一番。“也许召唤时得戴上这顶帽子。”于是她戴上帽子，开始喊：“魔猴，来呀！”

猴子们立即赶到。

“请你们帮助我的朋友们。”多萝西要求说。

“当然，”魔猴们回答，“我们总是帮助戴这顶黑色魔法帽的人。”

它们砸开阴暗的地窖，胆小鬼狮子走了出来。“重获自由了！”他说，“谢谢！”

之后，猴子们找到了稻草人的衣服，又填了些新稻草进去。稻草人笑着、跳着。“谢谢！”他说。

最后，猴子们修好了锡人，又给了他一个新油罐。锡人活动着胳膊和腿，“感觉好极了，”他说，“谢谢！”

多萝西对她的朋友们讲了巫婆和水的事，她的朋友们都非常开心。托托虽然不会说话，但它也高兴得上蹿下跳。

“现在，”多萝西说，“我们必须返回到奥兹魔法师那里。魔猴，带我们去绿宝石城！”

“别忘了戴上黑魔帽！”锡人说。

猴子们带他们飞上了天空，10分钟后他们就到了绿宝石城绿色的大门口。

The old man from Kansas

The little green man opened the door. He gave them all glasses, then he took them through the city to the Wizard's house. There, in the long green room, the friends waited, and waited... and waited.

After three hours the Scarecrow said, 'I'm tired of waiting.' He called the green man. 'We want to see the Wizard now . Or we're going to call the Magic Monkeys. Please tell the Wizard that.'

The green man went away to speak to the Wizard through the door. The Wizard knew about the Magic Monkeys, and he was very afraid of them. So he said to the green man, 'These people can come and see me at nine o'clock tomorrow morning.'

At nine o'clock the green man took the friends to the Wizard's room. They went in and looked all round, but they could not see anybody. Then a voice said, 'I am the Wizard of Oz. Who are you, and what do you want?'

'Where are you?' asked Dorothy.

'I am everywhere, but you can't see me. Now answer me—who are you and what do you want?'

'You know us all,' said the Scarecrow. 'You said to me, "Help Dorothy to kill the Witch of the West, and you can have some brains." Well, the Witch is dead, and now I want my brains.'

'And I want my heart,' said the Tin Man.

'And I want to be brave,' said the Cowardly Lion.

'And I want to go home to Kansas,' said Dorothy.

'Is the Witch truly dead?' asked the Voice.

'Yes,' said Dorothy. 'I threw a bucket of water over her, and she disappeared.'

'Very well,' said the Voice. 'Come again tomorrow. I must think about things first and—'

'No!' said the Tin Man. 'I want my heart now!'

'I'm not going to wait another minute!' said the Scarecrow.

'And I'm going to eat you!' the Lion shouted very angrily. Toto was afraid. He jumped away from the Lion, and hit a screen near the wall. The screen fell over, and behind it the friends saw an old man with no hair.

The Tin Man looked angry and picked up his axe.

'Who are you?' he said.

'Please don't hurt me!' said the old man, in a quiet little voice. 'I'm the Wizard of Oz.'

'But the Wizard of Oz is a big head without a body,' said Dorothy.

'No, he's a beautiful woman,' said the Scarecrow.

'You're wrong,' said the Tin Man. 'The Wizard of Oz is a big animal with two heads.'

'No,' said the Lion. 'The Wizard is a ball of fire.'

'You're all wrong,' said the old man. 'I am the Wizard... Well, I'm not a true wizard. Oh, I know a lot of tricks, but I don't know any true magic. You see, I'm from Kansas too. I went from town to town and did magic tricks. And I went up in a big balloon. The balloon was always on a rope, but one day something went wrong. The rope broke and the balloon blew away. For a long time the wind carried my balloon across the sky. Then I came down here, in the country of Oz. The people saw my balloon and said, "This man is a wizard! He comes out of the sky!" They were afraid of me and wanted to work for me... So they built this city for me, and I called it the Emerald City. Well, emeralds are green, so I made green glasses for everybody. That's why everything in the city looks green.'

The Scarecrow took off his glasses. 'Oh,' he said. 'Now I understand. The Emerald City isn't green. It just looks green. It's all a trick.'

'That's right,' said the old man. 'Well, all that happened many years ago. I never went out because I was afraid of the two bad Witches. Now they are dead—thanks to you, Dorothy. But I'm very sorry, I don't know any true magic, so I can't help you.'

'You're a very bad man,' said Dorothy.

'No, my child. I'm a very good man, but I am a very bad wizard, that's true.'

'What about my brains?' said the Scarecrow.

'You don't need brains. You understand things; you can think, you learn quickly. You're very clever.'

'I want brains,' said the Scarecrow.

'Very well,' said the old man. 'I can give you some brains tomorrow morning.'

'What about my heart?' asked the Tin Man.

'You don't need a heart,' said the old man. 'You laugh, you cry, you love, you feel sorry for people.'

The Tin Man looked angry and picked up his axe.

'All right—please don't hurt me!' said the old man. 'I can give you a heart tomorrow morning.'

'I want to be brave,' said the Cowardly Lion.

'But you are brave. You do a lot of brave things! No, no—don't eat me! Come here tomorrow morning. I'm going to make you brave.'

'What about Toto and me?' asked Dorothy.

'We can go up in my balloon,' said the Wizard. 'The wind blew us here from Kansas—perhaps it can blow us back to Kansas again.'

*　　*　　*

The next morning the friends came again to the Wizard's room. The old man was ready. He took a bottle with BRAINS on it in big green letters, and carefully opened the Scarecrow's head.

'Don't move. I'm putting your brains in,' he said. 'There—now you're the cleverest scarecrow in Oz.' The Scarecrow thanked him.

Next the Wizard gave the Tin Man a small red heart. 'Wear this always,' he said.

The Tin Man was very happy and thanked the Wizard again and again.

Then the old man took a bottle with BE BRAVE on it. 'Drink this,' he said to the Cowardly Lion.

The Lion drank. 'Yes. Yes, I feel brave!' he shouted. 'Very, very brave! Thank you!'

The Wizard smiled at them. 'You didn't need my magic,' he said. 'But you're all happy now, and that's a good thing. Now, Dorothy,' he said, 'come and see my balloon. It's all ready. I mended it last night.'

They went out into the garden behind the Wizard's house. The balloon was very big. There was a small box under it, and the Wizard of Oz jumped into the box.

'Come on, Dorothy!' he shouted. 'We're going to Kansas. Say goodbye to your friends.'

Dorothy kissed the Scarecrow, the Lion, and the Tin Man, and said goodbye. 'Come on, Toto,' she said. 'We're going home to Kansas. We're going to see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.'

But just then Toto saw a cat. He jumped out of Dorothy's arms and ran after it.

'Toto!' called Dorothy, and she began to run after him.

5 ．堪萨斯来的老头儿

绿衣小矮人打开了门。他给了他们每人一副眼镜，带他们穿过城市，来到魔法师的房子里。在那长长的绿房子里，他们几个等啊，等啊，等啊……

三个小时以后，稻草人说：“我讨厌就这么等下去了。”他叫绿衣人，“去告诉魔法师，我们现在 就要见他。否则我们要召唤魔猴来帮忙了。”

绿衣人隔着门将稻草人的话转告给了魔法师。魔法师知道魔猴是怎么回事，并且很怕它们。因此他对绿衣人说：“这些人可以在明天早上9点来见我。”

第二天9点钟，绿衣人将多萝西和她的朋友们带到魔法师那里。他们进去四处张望，却看不见任何人。这时一个声音响起了：“我就是奥兹魔法师，你们是谁？有什么要求？”

“你在哪儿？”多萝西问。

“我无处不在，但你们看不见我。现在回答我——你们是谁，有什么要求？”

“你认识我们，”稻草人说，“你还对我说过：‘帮助多萝西杀死西方女巫，你就可以得到智慧。’嗯，现在巫婆死了，我要我的智慧。”

“我要我的心。”锡人说。

“我要我的勇气。”胆小鬼狮子说。

“我要回堪萨斯的家。”多萝西说。

“巫婆真的死了？”那声音问道。

“是的，”多萝西回答说，“我朝她泼了一桶水，然后她就消失了。”

“很好，”声音说，“你们明天再来吧！我需要先考虑一下然后——”

“不行！”锡人说，“我现在就要我的心！”

“我一分钟都不愿再等了！”稻草人说。

“我要吃了你！”狮子怒吼道。托托吓坏了，它从狮子身边跳开，撞到墙边的一堵屏风上，屏风倒了，他们看见后面躲着一个秃顶的老头儿。

锡人举起斧子，一脸怒气。

“你是谁？”锡人问道。

“请别伤害我！”老头儿用细细的声音说，“我就是奥兹魔法师。”

“可奥兹魔法师是一个没有身体的大脑袋呀！”多萝西说。

“不，他是个漂亮的女人。”稻草人说。

“你们都错了，”锡人说，“奥兹魔法师是一个长了两个脑袋的怪兽。”

“不对，”狮子说，“魔法师是一团火。”

“你们都错了。”老头儿说，“我 是奥兹魔法师……嗯，我不是个真正的魔法师。哦，我虽然会变许多魔术，可我没有魔力。你们看，我也是堪萨斯人。我走乡串镇变魔术。我钻进一个大气球里，气球通常是拴在一根绳子上的，但是有一天出了意外，绳子断了，气球飞起来了。风使我的气球在天空中飘了很久。最后我落在了这儿——奥兹国。这儿的人看见我的气球，说：‘这人是魔法师！他从天而降！’他们都怕我，愿意为我效劳……所以他们为我修了这座城，我将它命名为绿宝石城。哦，绿宝石是绿色的，所以我给所有人都做了绿色的眼镜，这就是为什么城里一切看起来都是绿色的原因了。”

稻草人摘下眼镜。“噢，”他说，“我明白了，绿宝石城原来不是绿色的，只是看起来 是绿色的，这全是骗人的把戏。”

“完全正确，”老头儿说，“嗯，这些都是许多年前的事了。我从不出去是因为我怕两个坏巫婆。现在她们已死——谢谢你，多萝西，但是很抱歉，我不会真正的魔法，所以不能帮你。”

“你真是个坏蛋！”多萝西说。

“不，我的孩子，我是一个非常善良的人，但我的确是 一个糟糕的魔法师。一点不假。”

“那我要的智慧呢？”稻草人问。

“你不需要 智慧。你能理解事物，你会思考，你学东西也很快。你很聪明。”

“可我想要 智慧。”稻草人说。

“好吧，”老头儿说，“明早我会给你一些智慧。”

“那我的心呢？”锡人问。

“你不需要 心，”老头儿回答，“你笑，你哭，你爱别人，你同情别人。”

锡人气乎乎地举起他的斧子。

“好，好——别伤害我！”老头儿说，“我明早就给你一颗心。”

“我要变得勇敢，”胆小鬼狮子说。

“但你的确 很勇敢。你做了许多英勇的事情！别，别——别吃我！明早来吧，我会让你变得勇敢。”

“那我和托托怎么办？”多萝西问。

“我们可以钻进我的气球，”魔法师说，“风把我从堪萨斯吹到这儿——或许它也能把我们吹回堪萨斯。”

*　　*　　*

第二天早上，这几个朋友重新来到魔法师的屋里。老头儿已经准备就绪了。他拿出一个瓶子，瓶子上用绿色的字母写着两个大字“智慧”。他小心翼翼地打开稻草人的脑袋。

“别动，我要把智慧放入你的脑袋里，”老头儿说，“好——你现在是奥兹国最聪明的稻草人了。”稻草人谢过了老头儿。

然后老头儿又给了锡人一颗小小的红色的心。他说：“一直戴着它。”

锡人非常高兴，不停地感谢老头儿。

接着，老头儿拿出一个贴着“勇敢”标签的瓶子。“喝下去。”他对胆小鬼狮子说。

狮子喝了下去。“是的，是的。我感到自己有勇气了！”他大叫道，“非常非常的勇敢！谢谢你！”

魔法师微笑着望着他们。“你们并不需要我的魔法。”他说，“但你们现在很开心，这就好。现在，多萝西，”他说，“来看看我的气球，它已准备就绪，我昨晚把它修好了。”

他们一起走到魔法师房子后面的花园里。气球很大，下面挂了一个小箱子。魔法师跳进箱子里。

“多萝西，来呀！”他大喊，“我们要回堪萨斯去了，和你的朋友们告别吧。”

多萝西一一吻了稻草人、狮子和锡人，并与他们道了别。“走，托托，”她说，“我们就要回家了，我们就要见到埃姆舅妈和亨利舅舅了。”

但就在那时，托托看见了一只猫。它跳出多萝西的手臂，追了过去。

“托托！”多萝西大叫，开始追它。

'East, west—home's best!'

'Leave the dog and come quickly!' shouted the Wizard. 'The rope's going to break!'

Dorothy picked Toto up and ran. 'Wait!' she shouted.

But before she got there, the rope did break, and the balloon went up, up, up into the sky.

They heard the old man's voice, very far away.

'Ask the Witch of the So—o—o—outh.'

Then the balloon disappeared. And nobody saw the Wizard of Oz again.

Dorothy began to cry. 'Oh, how can I get home now?'

'Put on the magic black hat,' said the Scarecrow, 'and ask the Magic Monkeys for help. Perhaps they can find the Witch of the South and bring her here.'

'Clever Scarecrow!' said Dorothy. She put on the magic hat and called for the Magic Monkeys. When they arrived, she said, 'Please find the Witch of the South, and bring her here to the Emerald City.'

And five minutes later, a beautiful woman with long red hair arrived. 'I am Glinda, the Witch of the South,' she said. 'What can I do for you, my child?'

'I want to go home to Kansas,' said Dorothy. 'Please can you help me?'

'Ask your shoes,' smiled the good Witch. But Dorothy did not understand.

'Your red shoes,' said Glinda, 'are magic shoes. They can carry you home. Just close your eyes, and say, "East, west—home's best." Then jump.'

'Oh, thank you,' cried Dorothy happily.

She kissed her friends and said goodbye again. Then she picked up Toto and closed her eyes. 'East, west—home's best,' she said—and jumped. There was a noise like a wind, and suddenly Dorothy was in the sky. The red shoes fell off her feet, and she never saw them again.

When she opened her eyes, there she was—back in Kansas. And there were Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, in a field by a new little house.

'Dorothy!' cried Aunt Em. She ran and took Dorothy in her arms. 'Oh, Dorothy, what happened to you? And where did you come from?'

'From the country of Oz,' said Dorothy. 'But I'm home again now—and I'm so happy!'

6 ．“无论身在何方——家是最好的地方！”

“别追狗了，快来！”魔法师喊道，“绳子要断了！”

多萝西抱起托托就跑。“等一等！”她喊道。

可还没等她跑到那儿，绳子就 断了。气球越飞越高，一直飞到天空中。

他们听见老头儿的声音从远远的半空中传来。

“去问问南——方——女——巫。”

之后气球就消失了。从此再也没有人见过奥兹魔法师。

多萝西哭了起来：“哦，我现在怎么回家呀？”

“戴上黑魔帽，”稻草人说，“让魔猴来帮你。或许它们能找到南方女巫并把她带到这儿来。”

“聪明的稻草人！”多萝西说。她戴上魔帽召唤魔猴。猴子们来了以后，她说：“去找南方女巫，把她带到绿宝石城来。”

五分钟以后，一个长着一头红色长发的漂亮女人来了。她说：“我是南方女巫格琳达。”她说，“孩子，你想让我怎么帮你？”

“我想回我的家乡堪萨斯去，请问你能帮我吗？”多萝西说。

“让你的鞋子帮你吧。”善良的女巫笑着说。可是多萝西并不明白她的话。

“你的红鞋，”格琳达说，“是魔鞋。它们能带你回家。闭上眼睛，说：‘无论身在何方——家是最好的地方。’然后跳一下。”

“哦，谢谢你！”多萝西高兴地大叫。

她吻了朋友们，再一次和他们道别。然后她抱着托托，闭上眼睛。“无论身在何方——家是最好的地方。”她说道，然后跳了一下。耳边只听见呼呼的风声，一眨眼多萝西就在半空里了。红鞋子掉了下去，她再也没见过它们。

当她再次睁开眼睛时，发现已经回到了堪萨斯。她看见亨利舅舅和埃姆舅妈在一片田地里。田地边有一幢小小的新房子。

“多萝西！”埃姆舅妈喊着，朝她跑来，一把把她搂在怀中。“噢，多萝西，发生了什么事？你从哪儿回来的？”

“从奥兹国。”多萝西回答，“总算回家了——我太高兴了！”

内容简介

这是凯茜·威尔逊的第一份工作：同哈维一家生活在一起，照看两个年幼的孩子和料理家务。凯茜父母双亡，也没有兄弟姐妹。她希望在新家里过得快乐，但她不时感到孤独。孩子们的父亲邓肯常常出差去伦敦。凯茜喜欢孩子们，也喜欢邓肯的母亲老哈维太太，但她没有朋友。

当然，还有一个叫尼克的农场主，他住在田地的另一边。他的眼睛很蓝，笑容亲切而友善。但要和尼克交朋友并不容易，因为邓肯恨他，而凯茜同尼克出去吃晚饭也会让老哈维太太很生气。

但是邓肯为什么恨尼克呢？为什么尼克让凯茜在海滩屋要小心呢？为什么谁也不愿意谈到两年前过世的孩子们的母亲米兰达呢？哈维家有许多秘密，令凯茜产生了疑问。

很快，她开始揭开谜底，并终于明白了为什么每个人都忘不了米兰达……

REMEMBER MIRANDA

It is Cathy Wilson's first job. She is going to live with the Harvey family, and look after the two young children and the house. Cathy's parents are dead, and she has no brothers or sisters. She wants to be happy in her new home, but she is sometimes lonely. Duncan, the children's father, is often away in London. Cathy likes the children and she likes old Mrs Harvey, Duncan's mother, but she has no friends.

Of course, there is Nick, the farmer who lives across the fields. He has very blue eyes, and a warm, friendly smile. But it is not easy to be friendly with Nick, because Duncan hates him, and old Mrs Harvey gets angry when Cathy goes to dinner with Nick.

But why does Duncan hate Nick? Why does Nick tell Cathy to be careful at Beach House? And why does nobody want to talk about Miranda, the children's mother, who died two years ago? There are a lot of secrets in the Harvey family, and Cathy begins to ask questions.

Soon she begins to find the answers. And she learns why everybody remembers Miranda...

1Beach House

Beach House

The children and their father remember Miranda, of course, and they talk about her sometimes. Miranda's sister often visits us, and she always tells the children a story about their mother. Nick remembers Miranda; I know he does. And in the hospital, Grandma remembers, too. They all remember Miranda.

I never met Miranda, but every day I look at her photograph, next to the telephone in the kitchen, the picture of her with her children. Every day I look at her beautiful dark eyes and her long dark hair.

I first saw Miranda's photograph two years ago. It was a cold October day, and I left London for my new job with a family in Norfolk. I drove north, past Norwich, and it began to rain. It was dark and there was a strong wind so I drove slowly and carefully. I wanted to see the Harvey children before they went to bed. But because of the weather, it was eight o'clock before I arrived in Cromer. I drove through the town, along the sea road.

Suddenly, I stopped. There was a tree across the road. I got out of my car. It was a big tree, and I couldn't move it. Just then, a car drove up behind me and a man got out.

'What's the matter? Oh — a tree across the road.' He was a tall man, about thirty years old. 'Where are you going?' he asked.

'Not far,' I said. 'It's a house along this road, near the sea. It's called Beach House.'

'Oh, I know Beach House,' the man said. 'It's the last house along this road. But you can't drive there tonight, with this tree across the road.' He stopped for a minute. 'I'm Nick Watson, and I live at the farm along the road. We can go back to my house, and then walk across the fields to Beach House. Are you visiting for the weekend?'

'No, no. I'm going to work in the house and look after Mr Harvey's children. Their mother died two years ago, and their grandmother has arthritis in her legs and can't walk much now. So I'm going to look after the children and the house,' I told him. 'I met old Mrs Harvey in London, six weeks ago, and she gave me the job. Do you know the Harveys?'

The man laughed. His laugh was warm and friendly. 'Oh, yes, I know them,' he said.

We drove back down the road and into the farm. Then we walked across the fields. It was dark and windy and cold. After ten minutes we arrived at a big white house. The lights were on downstairs, and the house looked friendly. I had no home because my mother and father died a long time ago, and I had no brothers or sisters. This was my first job and I wanted to be happy in this house.

A man opened the door. He looked tired and there was no smile on his face.

'Hello, I'm Cathy Wilson,' I began. 'I'm very late, I know. It's because the weather's so bad.'

'There's a tree down across the road,' Nick said. 'So Cathy left her car at the farm and we walked here.'

Duncan Harvey looked at Nick. 'You always want to help,' he said coldly. 'And you're always there at the right time, ready to help.' His face was angry and I didn't understand why.

'The wind's very strong...' I began.

'It doesn't matter,' Nick said. He smiled at me and his eyes were very blue. 'Goodbye, Cathy. Come and get your car tomorrow.'

Duncan said nothing. I went into the house and he took me through into the kitchen.

'Mother, here's Cathy,' he said.

Old Mrs Harvey sat near the window. 'Hello, my dear,' she said warmly. 'What a wind! Come and have something to eat.' She stood up and walked slowly across the room. Her hair was white, and she had a stick because of her bad legs.

I sat down and began to eat.

'Duncan is angry because he doesn't like Nick,' Mrs Harvey told me quietly. 'He's not angry with you.'

Why didn't Duncan like Nick? I thought. I didn't understand, but I didn't like to ask Mrs Harvey.

The next morning I met the children. Tim was five years old. He ran up and down the garden with a football. Susan was seven years old, a quiet little girl with big brown eyes. She watched me carefully but she didn't smile.

The weather changed and the sun was warm. In the afternoon I walked with the children by the sea. The sky was blue and the sea was beautiful. I cooked dinner and we all ate in the kitchen.

After dinner Juliet arrived.

'I left my car at Nick's,' she said. 'There's a tree across the road.' Juliet had long black hair and dark eyes. She was Miranda's sister.

'Miranda was wonderful,' she told me. 'Wonderful and beautiful.'

'Yes, I know,' I said quietly. 'I saw the photograph of her, next to the telephone, with Tim and Susan.'

'Miranda is our mummy,' Susan said. 'She died a long time ago.'

'Let's go to the cinema,' Juliet said suddenly. 'I want to take Susan and Tim. Cathy, you come with us.'

Tim began to shout. 'Let's go to the cinema! Let's go to the cinema!'

'Be quiet, Tim!' Duncan said. He looked angry. 'No, Juliet. It's school tomorrow, and the children must go to bed early.'

Tim began to cry. 'I want to go with Juliet,' he said.

'No, Tim,' Duncan said.

'We can go to the cinema next weekend,' I said quickly. 'Let's play with your little cars now.' And soon Tim stopped crying.

The days went quickly. Duncan went to stay in London for three weeks for his work. He had a job with a big London company. He often worked on his computer at home, but he went away a lot, too. I liked the children and I liked old Mrs Harvey, but I had no friends.

One day, I came out of a shop in Cromer, and there was Juliet!

'Hello!' she said. 'It's good to see you! Let's go and have a coffee, and we can talk.'

And we did. Juliet told me about her teaching job, and she talked about Susan and Tim, and she talked about her sister.

'I often visited Miranda at Beach House because she wasn't happy there,' Juliet said quietly. 'Duncan is a difficult man; you can see that. He loved her, of course, but he was often away in London. She loved the children, and Grandma, but she was very lonely.'

I was lonely, too, at Beach House.

Juliet stood up and smiled warmly. 'I must go now. Let's go to the cinema this weekend with the children. Ask Grandma tonight, and ring me.'

And so I found a friend.

1． 海滩屋

孩子们和他们的父亲都忘不了米兰达，他们自然会不时谈到她。米兰达的妹妹经常来看我们，她总是告诉孩子们关于他们母亲的故事。尼克忘不了米兰达，我知道他忘不了。住院的奶奶也忘不了她。他们都忘不了米兰达。

我从没见过米兰达，但我每天都能看见她的照片，就放在厨房里的电话旁边，照片上是她和她的孩子们。每天我都能看到她那美丽的深色眼眸和她深色的长发。

我第一次看到米兰达的照片是在两年前。就在那年10月寒冷的一天，我离开了伦敦，赶往诺福克郡的一个人家，准备开始我的新工作。我驱车北行，过了诺里奇就下起雨来。当时天色昏暗，狂风大作，于是我小心翼翼，把车开得很慢。我想赶在哈维家的孩子们睡觉前见一见他们。但因为这天气，我到克罗默镇之前就已经8点了。我穿过这座小镇，沿着海边公路驱车前行。

突然，我停了下来——一棵树横在公路中间。我下了车。这是一棵大树，我无法挪动它。就在这时候，一辆小汽车开到我身后停了下来，一个男人从车里出来。

“出什么事了？哦——一棵树横在路上。”他个子高高的，三十岁左右。“你要去哪儿？”他问。

“不远了，”我回答，“就是这条路上的一栋房子，靠近海边，叫做海滩屋。”

“哦，我知道海滩屋，”那男人说道，“那是这条路上最后一栋房子。但是，这棵树横在路上，你今晚开车是没法去那里了。”他顿了顿。“我叫尼克·沃森，就住在这条路边上的农场里。我们可以一起去我家，然后穿过田地，步行去海滩屋。你是周末来串门的？”

“不，不是。我准备去那家工作，去照看哈维先生的孩子们。他们的妈妈两年前去世了，奶奶的腿又有关节炎，现在不能走太多路。所以，我是要去照看孩子们和料理家务。”我告诉他，“六个星期前，我在伦敦碰上了老哈维太太，她给了我这份工作。你认识哈维一家吗？”

那个男人笑了。他的笑温和而友好。“哦，是的，我认识他们。”他回答。

我们掉转车头沿路开进了农场。然后，我们步行穿过田地。天色漆黑，刮着风，很冷。十分钟后，我们来到了一栋大大的白色住宅前。楼下的灯亮着，这栋房子看起来舒适怡人。我没有家，因为我的父母很早以前就过世了，我也没有兄弟姐妹。这是我的第一份工作，我希望在这所房子里过得很快乐。

一个男人来开了门。他看起来很疲惫，脸上毫无笑意。

“你好，我是凯茜·威尔逊。”我开口道，“我知道，我来得太晚了，都是因为天气太差了。”

“一棵树横在了公路中间，”尼克说，“所以凯茜把她的车停在了农场，我们步行过来的。”

邓肯·哈维看着尼克。“你永远乐于助人，”他冷冷地说，“你总是在关键的时候出现，准备助人一臂之力。”他的脸看起来很生气，而我不明白为什么。

“风大极了……”我说。

“没关系，”尼克回答。他冲我笑笑，他的眼睛很蓝。“再见，凯茜。明天过来取你的车。”

邓肯什么也没说。我走进屋里，他带着我穿过屋子进了厨房。

“妈妈，凯茜来了。”他说。

老哈维太太坐在窗户旁边。“你好，亲爱的，”她热情地招呼我。“多大的风啊！快来，吃点什么吧。”她站起来，慢慢穿过房间。她满头白发，因为腿脚不好拄着拐杖。

我坐下来，开始吃东西。

“邓肯生气是因为他不喜欢尼克。”哈维太太悄悄地告诉我，“他不是在生你的气。”

邓肯为什么不喜欢尼克？我在想。我不明白，但是我也不想问哈维太太。

第二天早晨，我见到了孩子们。蒂姆5岁。他追着足球在花园中跑来跑去。苏珊7岁，是个文静的小姑娘，长着一双褐色的大眼睛。她小心翼翼地打量着我，脸上并没有笑容。

天气变了，太阳照得暖暖的。下午，我同孩子们一起在海边散步。天空是蓝色的，大海很美。我做好饭，大家在厨房共进晚餐。

晚餐后，朱丽叶来了。

“我把车停在尼克家了，”她说，“有棵树横在了路中间。”朱丽叶有一头长长的黑发和一双深色的眼睛。她是米兰达的妹妹。

“米兰达很出色，”她告诉我说，“很出色而且很漂亮。”

“是的，我知道。”我平静地回答，“我看到过她的照片，就在电话旁边，跟蒂姆和苏珊在一起。”

“米兰达是我们的妈妈，”苏珊说，“她很早以前就死了。”

“我们去看电影吧！”朱丽叶突然说，“我想带蒂姆和苏珊去，凯茜，你也和我们一块儿去吧！”

蒂姆开始嚷嚷：“我们去看电影吧！我们去看电影吧！”

“安静点儿，蒂姆！”邓肯说。他看起来很生气。“不行，朱丽叶。明天就要上学了，孩子们必须早点儿上床。”

蒂姆哭了起来，说道：“我想和朱丽叶一起去。”

“不行，蒂姆。”邓肯说。

“我们可以下个周末去看电影，”我马上说，“我们现在来玩儿你的小汽车吧。”很快蒂姆不哭了。

日子过得很快。邓肯因为工作要在伦敦待三个星期。他在伦敦的一家大公司里工作。他常常在家里用电脑办公，但也经常出差。我喜欢孩子们，也喜欢老哈维太太，可是我没有什么朋友。

有一天，我走出克罗默镇的一家商店，正巧碰上了朱丽叶。

“你好！”她说，“很高兴见到你！我们去喝杯咖啡吧，可以说说话！”

于是我们去了。朱丽叶跟我讲她教书的工作，讲苏珊和蒂姆，也讲她姐姐。

“我过去常常去海滩屋看米兰达，因为她在那里过得不开心。”朱丽叶悄悄地说，“邓肯是个很难相处的人，这你也能看得出来。当然他很爱她，但他老是去伦敦。她爱孩子们和奶奶，但她很孤独。”

在海滩屋，我也感到很孤独。

朱丽叶站起来，亲切地笑着说：“我现在必须走了。这周末我们带孩子们去看电影吧！今晚问一下奶奶，然后给我打电话吧。”

于是，我找到了一个朋友。

2The first secret

The first secret

The weather changed, and that autumn was warm and beautiful. Nearly every day I walked with the children along the beach. The sea was blue and friendly, and the trees, with their red and yellow autumn colours, looked beautiful in the sunlight. One afternoon we walked across the field and down the hill to the beach. Susan ran in front of Tim. They sang and laughed because they liked playing on the beach.

'Hello, Cathy. How are you?' someone said behind me.

I stopped. It was Nick, the tall farmer with the blue eyes. 'I'm well, thank you.'

'You look lonely,' he said, and smiled. 'You need some friends. Shall we meet in Cromer one day and have dinner?'

And so the next evening I drove to Nick's farm and we went into Cromer for dinner, and then we walked through the town to the gardens near the beach. I liked Nick. He was friendly and interesting. We didn't talk about the Harvey family all evening.

But before we said goodnight, Nick asked about Duncan. 'Are you going to tell Duncan about this evening?'

'No,' I said quickly. Then I stopped. 'Duncan is in London this month,' I went on slowly. 'Mrs Harvey told me — you and Duncan...'

Nick laughed quietly. 'So you have a secret now,' he said. 'Be careful, Cathy, at Beach House.'

'I don't understand,' I said. 'Why don't you like Duncan?'

'I can't talk about it,' Nick said.

I didn't tell Mrs Harvey about Nick, and perhaps that was wrong. But I did tell Juliet.

'I like Nick very much,' I told her. 'I want to see him again.' But Juliet was quiet and didn't talk much that afternoon.

That evening I put the children to bed and read them a story. Then I went slowly downstairs. I thought about Nick. I wanted to see him again.

Mrs Harvey sat quietly in her big chair in the kitchen. 'Cathy, I must talk to you, my dear,' she said. 'Come and sit down here.'

I sat down near her. I didn't want to talk — I wanted to finish my work in the kitchen and go upstairs to watch TV in my room.

'You're a good girl,' Mrs Harvey began kindly. 'Susan and Tim like you, and I'm very happy with your work in the house.'

I smiled, and waited for the 'but'. It arrived immediately.

'But I must talk to you about Nick Watson. Perhaps you are lonely here, with the children and me. Duncan is very quiet, I know that, and he's in London much of the time. But Nick doesn't like Duncan, and Duncan hates Nick. It's a long story and I don't want to talk about it. I'm not going to tell Duncan about your evening with Nick, but I don't want you to see Nick again.'

My face felt hot and my hands felt cold. Mrs Harvey knew about my dinner with Nick! Who told her? And why? I felt angry with Mrs Harvey because I wanted to see Nick again. But I didn't want to lose my job.

'I don't understand,' I began quietly.

Mrs Harvey stood up. 'Why must you understand?' she asked angrily. 'Don't see Nick Watson again! Do you hear me?'

'Grandma!'

We looked up, and saw Susan and Tim on the stairs. 'Children! What are you doing!' Mrs Harvey said. She took her stick and began to walk slowly across the room.

'Tim was afraid,' Susan said. 'He couldn't sleep, and so we came to call Cathy.'

'I wasn't afraid — you were afraid, because of Nick,' Tim said, and he pushed Susan.

'No, Tim!' Mrs Harvey shouted. Her face went white. 'Don't do that! Cathy, please go upstairs and put them back to bed.'

I ran upstairs and took the children back to their room. Tim put his little hands on my face and kissed me. 'Goodnight, Cathy,' he said. 'I like you.'

I smiled. 'I like you, too,' I said.

I said goodnight to Susan. 'I don't want Grandma to be angry with you,' she said quietly.

'Why are you afraid of Nick?' I asked.

'I don't know,' Susan said. 'Daddy hates him, but I don't know why.'

'He's a bad man,' Tim said. 'Grandma told me.'

And so I didn't see Nick again for a long time.

2． 第一个秘密

天气变换，那年秋天温暖而美丽。我几乎每天都要和孩子们沿着海滩散步。大海湛蓝、静谧。树木都染上了红红黄黄的秋天的色彩，在阳光下看起来很是漂亮。一天下午，我们穿过田地，沿着山坡而下，到了海边。苏珊跑在蒂姆前头，他们唱着、笑着，因为他们喜欢在海滩玩耍。

“嗨，凯茜。你好吗？”有人从后头跟我打招呼。

我站住了，是尼克，那个长着一双蓝眼睛的高个子农场主。“我很好，谢谢。”

“你看起来很孤独，”他笑着说，“你需要一些朋友。哪天我们能在克罗默镇碰个面吃顿饭吗？”

于是，第二天傍晚，我开车去了尼克的农场，同他一道去克罗默镇吃了晚饭。然后，我们步行穿过小镇去了海滩附近的花园。我喜欢尼克。他很友好，也很风趣。整个晚上，我们都没有提哈维一家。

但是就在我们互道晚安之前，尼克问起了邓肯。“你打算把今天晚上的事告诉邓肯吗？”

“不，”我马上回答，然后打住了。“这个月邓肯在伦敦，”我慢慢地接着说，“哈维太太告诉我——你和邓肯……”

尼克轻轻地笑了。“所以你现在有秘密了。”他说，“凯茜，你在海滩屋要小心点儿。”

“我不明白，”我说，“为什么你不喜欢邓肯？”

“我不能说。”尼克回答。

我没有告诉哈维太太关于尼克的事。也许那样不对。但我确实告诉了朱丽叶。

“我非常喜欢尼克。”我告诉她，“我想再次见到他。”但是朱丽叶很沉默，那天下午都没怎么说话。

那天晚上，我把孩子们弄上床，给他们讲了个故事。然后，我慢慢下了楼。我想到了尼克。我想再次见到他。

哈维太太静静地坐在她厨房中的大椅子里。“凯茜，亲爱的，我必须和你谈谈，”她说，“过来坐这儿吧。”

我在她旁边坐下。我不想闲谈——我想干完厨房里的活儿，上楼回自己房间看电视。

“你是个好姑娘，”哈维太太和蔼地开口道，“苏珊和蒂姆都喜欢你，你在家里干得不错，我很高兴。”

我笑着等着她说“但是”。很快她就转折了。

“但是我必须跟你谈谈尼克·沃森的事儿。也许你在这里，同孩子们和我在一起，很孤单。我知道，邓肯沉默寡言，而且有很多时候都在伦敦。但是尼克不喜欢邓肯，而邓肯憎恨尼克。这事说来话长，我不想说这些。我不打算告诉邓肯那天晚上你同尼克的事，但我也不希望你再去见尼克。”

我的脸在发烫，双手却冰凉。哈维太太知道了我同尼克共进晚餐！谁告诉她的？为什么？哈维太太让我感到很生气，因为我想再见见尼克。但我不想丢了工作。

“我不明白。”我小声地说。

哈维太太站起来。“为什么你必须要明白？”她生气地问，“不要再见尼克·沃森！听见我说的了吗？”

“奶奶！”

我们抬头看去，发现苏珊和蒂姆站在楼梯上。“孩子们！你们在干什么？”哈维太太说。她拿起拐杖，开始慢慢地穿过房间。

“蒂姆很害怕，”苏珊说，“他睡不着，所以我们来叫凯茜。”

“我不害怕——是你 害怕，因为尼克。”蒂姆边说边推苏珊。

“不，蒂姆！”哈维太太喊道。她的脸变得苍白。“别那么做！凯茜，请上楼，把他们弄上床吧。”

我跑上楼，把孩子们带回到他们的房间。蒂姆把他的小手放在我脸上，亲了亲我。“晚安，凯茜。”他说，“我喜欢你。”

我笑了。“我也喜欢你。”我回答。

我向苏珊说晚安。“我不想奶奶生你的气。”她轻轻地说。

“你为什么怕尼克？”我问。

“我不知道，”苏珊回答，“爸爸恨他，但我不知道为什么。”

“他是一个坏人，”蒂姆说，“奶奶告诉过我。”

于是，有很长一段时间我都没有再见尼克。

3A terrible accident

A terrible accident

Duncan came back and worked at home again. Why did he hate Nick? I wanted to understand, but I couldn't ask because I was a little afraid of Duncan. He didn't talk much and he worked for hours in his room.

Old Mrs Harvey liked to cook, but because of her arthritis she couldn't cook much and she couldn't look after the children and the house. She often felt upset because of this. But she was much happier with Duncan at home. She smiled more and she cooked breakfast for him nearly every day. Sometimes she made bread. Duncan was kind to his mother and he played with the children every day. He drove them to school every morning and I drove them home in the afternoons.

One Friday afternoon I drove away from Beach House past Nick's farm. Just then, I saw Nick's Landrover on the farm road. 'He's driving very fast,' I thought. 'Oh no! He's not going to stop—' And he didn't. He drove out of the farm road and very nearly hit my car. I couldn't stop, So I drove off the road and the Landrover went past, only centimetres away.

The Landrover stopped. Nick got out, ran back to my car, and opened the door. 'Cathy! Are you all right?'

Then I saw a girl in the Landrover. It was Juliet. She got out and came up to us.

'You must drive more carefully, Nick!' she said angrily. 'You nearly hit Cathy then.' She wore a beautiful red coat and black trousers. Her dark eyes were angry, but they looked at Nick and not at me.

'Cathy's all right,' he said to her. He put his hand on her arm. His blue eyes were kind, but they looked at Juliet and not at me.

'We don't want more accidents,' Juliet said quietly. 'Remember Miranda.'

'Please move your Landrover,' I said coldly. 'I must get to school for the children. I'm going to be late.'

'Don't be angry.' Nick smiled at me. 'I'm very sorry.' He got back into the Landrover and moved it.

Juliet stood by my car.

'So you and Nick are friends,' I said to her. 'You didn't tell me about that.'

Juliet said nothing for a minute. 'You don't understand,' she said in the end. 'It's very difficult.'

I drove back on to the road. I nearly cried, and I felt very angry. Juliet was my friend. I had coffee with her and went to the cinema with her, but she said nothing about Nick. Why not? I had dinner with Nick and we talked all evening, but he said nothing about Juliet. Why not? I felt angry with Juliet and with Nick.

That evening Mrs Harvey's arthritis was bad and she went to bed early. Duncan cooked dinner and I ate with him and the children. Duncan talked and laughed with the children and I felt happy to be with them. Once, I felt Duncan's eyes on me, and suddenly my face felt hot. I didn't want to think about Juliet and Nick.

But later, in my room, I remembered Juliet's angry face and eyes. We don't want more accidents. Remember Miranda. Then I remembered old Mrs Harvey in London. The children's mother died two years ago. She told me that, but she didn't tell me about an accident. Perhaps it was a car accident? Perhaps Nick killed Miranda with his Landrover? Duncan hates Nick. Mrs Harvey told me that, too. Did Duncan hate Nick because Nick killed Miranda?

I slept in the end, but I didn't sleep well. The next day was Saturday and I was free in the morning. Duncan went to the shops with the children and I went to the library in Cromer. Miranda died on 30th September, two years ago. I knew that. Perhaps the town's newspaper wrote about her after she died. I must find something about her because I wanted to understand the Harvey family.

I found the old newspapers and began to read. The newspaper of 1st October told me everything.

YOUNG MOTHER DIES IN TERRIBLE ACCIDENT

Miranda Harvey, aged 26, fell down the stairs at her home and died later in hospital. Miranda lived with her husband and two children not far from Cromer. Duncan Harvey's mother lives with them. 'This is a terrible day for the Harvey family,' she said. 'We all loved Miranda very much, and now her two little children are without a mother.'

I sat with my head in my hands. I could not move. We don't want more accidents. Remember Miranda. It wasn't a car accident; Miranda, that wonderful mother, fell down the stairs at Beach House — and I ran up and down those stairs six or seven times a day.

Then I looked at some of the later newspapers.

POLICE QUESTION DUNCAN HARVEY

Harvey, aged 34, was at home on the day of his wife's accident. He was upstairs with her before she fell. Then he went downstairs to the kitchen. How did the accident happen? Harvey does not know. He heard nothing, he says.

The police questioned Duncan for two days, I read, but in the end he went home to his children. It wasn't Nick, in his Landrover. Miranda died at home, and the police questioned Duncan. My hands were cold, my legs were cold, and I felt afraid.

Things were different at Beach House after my visit to the library. The house was a house with a secret, and the Harveys were a family with a secret. I thought about Miranda and the accident every day. I wanted to talk to someone about it, but I was afraid. Why did the police question Duncan? Be careful at Beach House. Why did Nick say that to me? Was it because of Miranda's accident? There were more questions in my head now. And the biggest question was this: did Miranda fall — or did someone push her?

3． 可怕的意外

邓肯回家了，又开始在家里工作。为什么他恨尼克？我想知道，但我不能问，因为我有点儿怕邓肯。他不爱说话，在自己的房间里一工作就是几个小时。

老哈维太太喜欢做饭，但因为她患有关节炎，不能做得太多，她也无法照看孩子们和打理家务。这一切经常让她感到很苦恼。但邓肯在家时，她会高兴得多。她笑得也比较多了，而且几乎每天都为他做早餐。有时她会做面包。邓肯对他母亲很好。他每天都会陪孩子们玩儿。他每天早晨开车把孩子们送到学校，我每天下午开车把他们接回家。

一个周五的下午，我从海滩屋开车出来，路过尼克的农场。就在这时，我看见尼克的“路虎”车在农场公路上飞奔。“他开得太快了。”我想，“哦，不！他不打算停下来——”他确实没有停车！他的车冲出农场公路，几乎撞到了我的车。我没法停车，只能开离了公路，“路虎”开了过去，离我的车只有几厘米远。

“路虎”停了下来。尼克下车往回跑到我的车边，拉开门。“凯茜，你还好吗？”

这时，我看见一个女孩坐在“路虎”里，是朱丽叶。她下了车，走上前来。

“你开车应该更小心一些，尼克！”她生气地说，“你当时差点儿就撞到凯茜了。”她穿着一件漂亮的红外套和一条黑裤子。她深色的眼睛看起来很愤怒，但它们盯着尼克，而不是我。

“凯茜没事儿，”他对她说。他把手放在她的手臂上。他的蓝眼睛看起来很亲切，但它们看着朱丽叶，而不是我。

“我们都不想再出意外了。”朱丽叶轻轻地说，“记住米兰达。”

“请把你的‘路虎’移开，”我冷冷地说道。“我得去接孩子们。我要晚了。”

“别生气。”尼克冲我笑笑。“我很抱歉。”他回到“路虎”上，启动汽车。

朱丽叶站在我的车旁。

“这么说你和尼克是朋友。”我对她说，“你没有告诉过我。”

朱丽叶沉默了一分钟。“你不明白，”她最后说，“这很难跟你说清。”

我把车开回到公路上。我几乎要哭出来了，我很愤怒。朱丽叶是我的朋友。我和她一起喝咖啡，一起看电影，但她一点儿都没有提到尼克。为什么不说？我和尼克一起吃晚饭，我们谈了一晚上，但他一点儿都没有提到朱丽叶。为什么不说？朱丽叶和尼克都让我生气。

那天晚上，哈维太太的关节炎犯得很严重，她很早就睡了。邓肯做的晚餐，我和他以及孩子们一起吃的饭。邓肯与孩子们说说笑笑。跟他们在一起，我感到很快乐。有一瞬间，我感觉到邓肯在看我，我的脸突然烫起来。我不愿意去想朱丽叶和尼克。

但是后来，在我的房间里，我想起了朱丽叶愤怒的表情和双眼。“我们都不想再出意外了 。记住米兰达 。”于是，我又想起了老哈维太太在伦敦的时候。“孩子们的妈妈两年前去世了 。”她告诉我这件事，但并没有跟我说那是个意外。也许是出了车祸？也许是尼克开着他的“路虎”杀了米兰达？“邓肯憎恨尼克 。”哈维太太也曾说过。难道邓肯恨尼克是因为尼克杀了米兰达？

最终我还是睡了，但睡得不好。第二天是星期六，上午我可以自由安排。邓肯和孩子们出去购物了。而我去了克罗默镇的图书馆。我知道，米兰达死于两年前的9月30日。也许，这个小镇的报纸在她死后报道过她。我必须查明一些关于她的事，因为我想了解哈维一家。

我找到了那些旧报纸，开始阅读。10月1日的报纸告诉了我一切。

年轻的母亲死于可怕的事故

米兰达·哈维，26岁，从家中的楼梯上摔了下来，稍后在医院去世。米兰达同她的丈夫和两个孩子生活在一起，住在克罗默镇附近。邓肯·哈维的母亲同他们住在一起。“对哈维家来说，这是可怕的一天。”她说，“我们都非常爱米兰达，而现在她的两个小孩失去了母亲。”

朱丽叶，24岁，米兰达的妹妹，是克罗默镇一所学校的教师。“我姐姐是一位很出色的母亲，”她说，“对我而言是一位慈爱的姐姐。”

我双手抱头坐在那里，一动不动。“我们都不想再出意外了 。记住米兰达 。”那不是车祸。米兰达，这位出色的母亲，是从海滩屋的楼梯上摔了下来——而我每天都要在这楼梯上跑上跑下六七回。

然后，我又看了一些后来的报纸。

警察盘问邓肯·哈维

哈维，34岁，他妻子出事那天正在家中。在他妻子摔下来前，他俩都在楼上。随后他下楼去了厨房。意外是怎么发生的呢？哈维并不知道。他说，他什么都没听到。

报纸上说，警察盘问了邓肯两天，但最后他回家了，回到了孩子们身边。这意外不是因为尼克开着“路虎”造成的。米兰达死在家里，警察盘问了邓肯。我手脚冰凉，我感到很害怕。

从我去过图书馆之后，海滩屋的一切都不同了。这所房子是一所藏着秘密的房子，哈维一家是藏着秘密的一家。我成天想着米兰达和那场意外。我想找个人说说这事，但我很害怕。为什么警察会盘问邓肯？“在海滩屋要小心点儿 。”为什么尼克对我说这个？是因为米兰达的意外吗？现在我脑子里的疑问更多了。而最大的疑问就是：米兰达是自己摔下去的——还是有人把她推下去的？

4Not one of the family

Not one of the family

Winter came. The weather was cold and windy, but sometimes when the weather was a little better I walked on the beach with the children. Two or three times I saw Nick and he smiled and we talked a little. I liked Nick, but I was angry with him because of Juliet, and he didn't ask me to dinner again.

School finished for Christmas, and I drove the children to a farm near Cromer to buy a Christmas tree. After my mother and father died, Christmas was a bad time for me because I was lonely. 'But this year,' I thought, 'I'm going to be with the Harvey family. Perhaps I can forget about Miranda's accident and feel happy at Christmas.'

'Christmas is coming! Christmas is coming!' the children sang. They were very happy about Christmas.

We walked through the farm and looked at the Christmas trees. Tim ran up and down. 'I want this tree, Cathy!' he called. Then he ran up and down again. 'I want this tree, Cathy!' he called again.

Suddenly he ran into a tree and then fell over. When he fell, his head hit a second tree. He began to cry.

I ran to him. There was a long cut on his head and a lot of blood.

'Don't cry, Tim. You're going to be all right,' I said quietly. 'Let's go to the hospital and see the doctor.'

'Oh no!' cried Susan. 'The hospital! Is Tim going to die?'

'No, no. Tim's going to be all right. But the doctor must look at this cut on his head,' I said. I carried Tim to the car and drove quickly to the hospital. After we saw the doctor, I phoned Duncan and he came to the hospital.

Susan ran to him. 'Daddy, there was an accident, and there was a lot of blood. Is he going to die?'

Duncan sat down. His face was white, but he smiled at Susan and Tim. 'Tim's going to be OK. Look at him! He's feeling much better now.'

Duncan put his arm around me. 'Thank you, Cathy,' he said. 'You're very good with the children. Beach House is a happier home now, with you there.' Slowly we walked out of the hospital. 'Please come home in the car with us,' Duncan said. 'We can come back later for your car. Please.'

I liked Duncan then, and I wanted to go with him and the children. But I was afraid, too, because of Miranda's accident. I didn't want to talk to him, and so I went home in my car.

The next day Juliet came to see Tim. She played with the children and then she stayed for dinner. After the children went to bed, she came to see me in my room.

'I'm sorry, Cathy,' she began. 'I wanted to see you, but I was afraid because you're angry with me.'

'Yes, I am angry,' I said slowly. 'You were my friend. I went to dinner with Nick and I told you everything, but you didn't tell me about you and Nick. Why not?'

Juliet looked at me but said nothing.

'Why didn't Nick tell me about you? Did he tell you about our dinner?'

'Yes. I was upset, but Nick likes to talk to women. He likes you and he wanted to take you to dinner. But he loves me and nothing is going to change that.' She stopped. 'I told Grandma about your dinner with Nick, because I didn't want you to be friends with Nick.'

'You don't want her to know about you and Nick, but you told her about my dinner with Nick! Why? I don't understand!'

'I'm sorry. I love him very much; he's everything to me. But our love is a secret. Duncan hates Nick, and I don't want him to know about our love.'

'There are a lot of secrets in this family,' I said. 'Secrets about you and Nick. Secrets about Miranda. Why didn't you tell me about Miranda's accident?'

'How do you know about that?' Juliet asked.

'I went to the library and read about it in the newspapers.'

Juliet stood up. 'Nobody talks about Miranda's accident,' she said. 'Nobody saw her when she fell down the stairs.'

I wanted to ask about Duncan. I wanted to ask: 'Why did the police question Duncan?' but I was afraid of the answer. 'Well, I don't like living with all these secrets,' I said. 'Every time I go downstairs I remember Miranda.'

Juliet laughed then, and it was a cold laugh. 'We all live with that, Cathy. You're not one of the family; you're not going to fall downstairs.'

*　*　*

Tim felt better the next day, and in the afternoon Duncan took the children back to the farm to buy the Christmas tree. And then I phoned Nick.

'I want to talk to you,' I said quietly. 'I need to talk to someone.'

'Mmm,' said Nick. 'Let's meet on the beach. At three o'clock.'

I waited in my room and listened to the sea and the wind. Perhaps Juliet was with Nick. I didn't know, but I needed to talk to someone about the Harvey family. I walked slowly across the field and down the hill to the beach. It was a cold afternoon and there was a strong wind. The sea was dark. Nick wasn't there; perhaps he didn't want to talk to me. But in the end he arrived.

'What's the matter?' he asked.

'I talked to Juliet last night,' I began. 'About Miranda. I don't know why, but I feel afraid. What do you know about Miranda's accident?'

'The police questioned Duncan,' Nick said. His blue eyes looked past me. Suddenly his face changed. 'Duncan's here. Did you tell him to come?'

'No, I didn't. He left the house before I called you.'

Duncan ran down the hill. 'Cathy!' he called.

'What are you doing here?' Nick said angrily. 'Cathy wants to talk to me.'

'Cathy, come home,' Duncan said quietly.

'She's not going back with you. She's afraid of you.'

'Afraid of me? Why?'

I said nothing. Duncan's face was angry.

'Why don't you tell us about Miranda?' Nick asked. His face was angry, too. 'I want to ask you something. The police questioned you, Duncan. What did you tell them about that night?'

'So you're asking me about Miranda,' Duncan shouted. 'You remember Miranda, then? Well, I remember, too. I remember her every day.' Duncan looked at me, and then back at Nick. 'You think I killed Miranda? Go to the police, then, and tell them that. Yes, I hated her, and I hated you, too, Nick. She wanted to leave me and the children because of you. She loved you. She told me that. But did you love her, Nick?'

'Of course I didn't,' Nick said. His face was red. 'I liked Miranda. We went to dinner four or five times, that's all. She was lonely.' He looked at me. His eyes were very blue, but suddenly I didn't like his eyes and I didn't like his face.

'She wanted to leave me and her children, but you didn't love her,' Duncan said. 'You loved her sister. I know that. But Miranda didn't know about you and Juliet. Why didn't you tell her?'

I didn't want to listen. I felt ill and very cold, and I began to walk back up the hill. I wanted to go home, but where was my home? I didn't have one.

4． 家里的外人

冬天来了。天气寒冷而多风。但每当天气稍微好些，我就会和孩子们去海滩上散步。有两三次我看见了尼克，他微笑着，我们会说上几句话。我喜欢尼克，但因为朱丽叶，我在生他的气，而他也再没有邀我共进晚餐。

圣诞节快到了，学校放假了，我开车带孩子们去克罗默镇附近的一个农场买圣诞树。在我父母去世后，圣诞节对我来说是难捱的日子，因为我很孤独。“但是今年，”我想，“我将和哈维一家人在一起。也许，我可以忘掉米兰达的意外，过一个快乐的圣诞节。”

“圣诞节快到了！圣诞节快到了！”孩子们唱着。圣诞节的到来让他们非常高兴。

我们在农场里逛，挑选圣诞树。蒂姆跑来跑去。“我想要这棵树，凯茜！”他叫着。然后又到处跑起来。“我想要这棵树，凯茜！”他又嚷道。

突然，他撞上了一棵树，跌倒了。跌倒时，他的头又撞到了另一棵树。他哭了起来。

我向他跑过去。他的头被划了一道长长的口子，流了很多血。

“别哭，蒂姆。你会没事儿的，”我轻轻地说，“我们去医院看看大夫吧。”

“噢，不！”苏珊哭着说，“医院！蒂姆要死了吗？”

“不，不。蒂姆会好的，但医生必须检查他头上的伤口。”我回答。我把蒂姆抱上车，迅速开车到了医院。看过医生后，我给邓肯打了电话，他到医院来了。

苏珊向他跑去。“爸爸，出了意外，有很多血，他会死吗？”

邓肯坐下来。他的脸色苍白，但他笑着对苏珊和蒂姆说：“蒂姆会没事的。看看他！他现在感觉好多了。”

邓肯伸手搂住了我。“谢谢你，凯茜，”他说，“你对孩子们这么好。有你在，海滩屋现在都更快乐了。”我们慢慢地走出医院。“请上车和我们一起回家吧，”邓肯说，“我们可以回头再来取你的车。来吧。”

当时我喜欢上了邓肯，我想同他和孩子们一起走。但是我又害怕——因为米兰达的意外。我不想和他说话，于是我自己开车回了家。

第二天，朱丽叶来看蒂姆。她陪孩子们玩儿，然后留下来吃了晚餐。孩子们睡觉后，她到我的房间来看我。

“对不起，凯茜。”她开口道，“我想见你，但又怕你生我的气。”“没错，我是很生气，”我慢慢地说，“你是我的朋友。我去跟尼克吃饭，我把一切都告诉了你，但你却没有告诉我你和尼克的事。为什么不告诉我呢？”

朱丽叶望着我，但一言不发。

“为什么尼克不告诉我你的事呢？他告诉你我们共进晚餐的事了吗？”

“是的，我很烦恼，但是尼克喜欢同女人搭讪。他喜欢你，想带你去吃晚餐。但他爱我，没有什么会改变这些。”她顿了顿，“我把你和尼克吃晚餐的事告诉了奶奶，因为我不想让你和尼克成为朋友。”

“你不想让她知道你 和尼克的事，可你却把我同尼克吃晚餐的事告诉了她！为什么？我不明白！”

“对不起。我非常爱他；对我来说，他就是一切。但我们的爱是个秘密。邓肯恨尼克，而我不想让他知道我们相爱。”

“这个家里的秘密很多。”我说，“关于你和尼克的秘密，关于米兰达的秘密。为什么你不告诉我米兰达的那次意外呢？”

“你是怎么知道那件事的？”朱丽叶问。

“我去了图书馆，从报纸上得知的。”

朱丽叶站起来。“没有人提起米兰达的那次意外。”她说，“当她从楼梯上跌下来的时候，没有人看见。”

我想问问邓肯的事。我想问：“为什么警察盘问邓肯？”但我害怕听到答案。“嗯，我不希望同所有的这些秘密生活在一起，”我说，“我每次下楼都会想起米兰达。”

结果，朱丽叶笑了起来，是冷笑。“我们都同这秘密生活在一起，凯茜。你不是这家中的一员，你不会摔下楼的。”

*　*　*

第二天，蒂姆感觉好些了。下午，邓肯带孩子们回那个农场去买圣诞树。于是，我给尼克打了个电话。

“我想和你谈谈。”我平静地说，“我需要跟人说说话。”

“嗯——，”尼克回答，“我们就在海滩见吧。3点钟。”

我在自己的房间里等待，听着海浪声和风声。也许，朱丽叶正和尼克在一起，我不知道，但我需要跟人谈谈哈维家的事。我慢慢走过田地，走下山坡，到了海边。那天下午很冷，刮着大风，大海昏暗一片。尼克不在那儿，也许他不想和我说话。但他最终还是来了。

“出什么事了？”他问。

“昨晚，我同朱丽叶谈了话，”我说，“关于米兰达，不知道为什么，我感到害怕。有关米兰达的意外，你知道些什么？”

“警察盘问了邓肯，”尼克说。他的蓝眼睛越过我望着我身后。突然，他的脸色变了。“邓肯在这儿，你叫他来的吗？”

“不，我没有。我给你打电话前他就离开家了。”

邓肯跑下山坡。“凯茜！”他喊道。

“你来这儿干什么？”尼克生气地说，“凯茜想和我聊聊。”

“凯茜，回家。”邓肯平静地说。

“她不愿跟你回家。她怕你。”

“怕我？为什么？”

我什么都没说。邓肯一脸愤怒。

“为什么你不告诉我们米兰达的事呢？”尼克问。他的脸看起来也很愤怒。“我想问问你，邓肯，警察曾盘问过你，关于那天晚上，你告诉了他们些什么？”

“原来你是问我米兰达的事，”邓肯吼起来，“这么说，你还记得米兰达？啊，我也记得。我每天都想着她。”邓肯看看我，又转回去盯着尼克。“你认为是我杀了米兰达？那就去找警察吧，去告诉他们。是的，我恨她，我也恨你，尼克。就因为你，她想离开我和孩子。她爱你。她告诉我了。但是你爱她吗，尼克？”

“当然，我不爱她。”尼克说。他的脸红了。“我喜欢米兰达。我们一起吃了四五回饭，仅此而已。她很孤独。”他望着我，他的眼睛很蓝，但突然我不喜欢他的眼睛和他的脸了。

“她想离开我和孩子，但你并不爱她，”邓肯说，“你爱的是她妹妹。我知道。可是米兰达不知道你和朱丽叶的事。你为什么不告诉她呢？”

我不想听了。我感到很难受、很冷。我开始往回走，爬上山坡。我想回家，但我的家在哪里？我没有家。

5Home

Home

'Cathy! Wait for me!' It was Duncan. He ran up behind me. 'I want to talk to you, Cathy. Listen — all women like Nick. I know that. But he's not a good friend for you to have. You heard him on the beach. He likes to have lots of women friends. How can you be happy with a man like that?'

'You're wrong,' I said slowly. 'I stopped liking Nick weeks ago.' Nick wasn't important to me now, I knew that. But Duncan was important to me — and I couldn't tell him. For a minute or two I said nothing, but the questions were still there. In the end I said: 'Why didn't you tell me about Miranda's accident? Why was it a secret? I feel very upset about all this.'

'I wanted to forget all about it,' Duncan said slowly. 'It was a very difficult time. Miranda and Juliet loved Nick. Juliet hated Miranda. She was afraid because Miranda wanted to live with Nick. Juliet told me about Miranda and Nick because she wanted me to stop Miranda.'

'Juliet told me about her love for Nick. It was a secret, she said.'

'A secret?' Duncan laughed angrily. 'Well, Miranda never knew about it, it's true. Juliet's very careful — she never talks about Nick. But it wasn't difficult to see. I saw her car at his farm, and I often see it there now.'

The sky was darker now. 'Was Juliet here, the night Miranda died?' I asked. Perhaps Juliet killed her sister, I thought.

'No, no. Juliet wasn't here, Nick wasn't here,' Duncan said. 'I was upstairs, and the children were in bed. Then Miranda called me into our bedroom and said: “I'm going to leave you, Duncan. I'm going to live with Nick.” I was very angry and upset, but I ran downstairs into the kitchen before she fell. Cathy, nobody killed Miranda. It was an accident, a terrible accident.' Duncan put his hand on my arm. 'Can't you forget about Miranda now? Can't we begin again?'

But I couldn't answer then.

We arrived at Beach House. There was a light downstairs in the kitchen, and a light in the sitting room.

'The children are watching television,' Duncan said. We went into the house and Duncan opened the sitting room door. 'We're home now,' he told the children. 'We're going to the kitchen to make dinner.'

The kitchen was warm and quiet. Old Mrs Harvey sat in her chair. Suddenly, I felt afraid again. There was something terrible about old Mrs Harvey's face. I stood by the kitchen door; I couldn't go into the room.

'We're back, Mother,' Duncan said. 'Cathy's with me; everything's all right.'

Mrs Harvey's eyes were dark in her white face. 'I was afraid, Duncan! I was afraid! The children love Cathy, and you love Cathy. I can see that. But Cathy loves Nick. She's going to leave you and the children. Remember Miranda! It's all happening again. I can see that.'

'Mother! It's not true! Don't talk like this!'

'Remember Miranda!' Mrs Harvey said again. 'Don't be upset, Duncan. I'm always here, you know that. I can't look after you because of my arthritis, but I love you most, you know that, and I'm going to help you again.'

Suddenly I understood it all. 'Tell us about Miranda,' I said quietly. 'What did you do that night?'

Mrs Harvey looked at me then. 'I don't want you to leave, Cathy. I want you to stay with the children and be happy with Duncan. Let me tell you about that night,' she said, 'and then you must stay here with us.'

The room was very quiet. Duncan held my hand, and his hand was warm and strong.

'Miranda wanted to leave Duncan. I was upstairs in my room, and I heard her. Duncan ran downstairs and I came out of my room and talked to Miranda. She hated Duncan, and she didn't want to think about her children.' Mrs Harvey began to cry. 'I pushed her. She was on the stairs, and I pushed her with my stick. She fell down the stairs, and I went back into my room. I didn't want to kill her, I wanted to break her legs. I wanted her to stay at home with Duncan. But she died, and in the end I was happy because she didn't go and live with Nick...'

Mrs Harvey talked and talked, and in the end we stopped listening to her.

'Cathy, this is all going to be very difficult,' Duncan said, tiredly. 'I must call the police and tell them about mother. Then I must talk to the children. It's going to be difficult for you, too. Are you going to leave Beach House?'

I smiled. There were no more questions in my head. I knew everything now about the Harvey family: there was nothing more to be afraid of. 'No, Duncan, I'm not going to leave.'

'The children need you,' he said. 'You know that. But I need you too. I want you to be with me. But can we be happy after all this?'

'Of course we can,' I told him. 'Things are going to get better now, for all of us.'

He put his arms around me. He kissed me then, and I found my home in his arms.

5． 家

“凯茜，等等我！”是邓肯。他从我后面跑上来。“我想和你谈谈，凯茜。听着，所有的女人都喜欢尼克。这我知道。但他不是一个值得你拥有的朋友。你听见他在海滩上说的了。他喜欢同很多女人做朋友。你和这样的男人在一起怎么会幸福呢？”

“你错了。”我慢慢地说，“我几个星期前就不再喜欢尼克了。”我知道，现在尼克对我而言已经不重要了。但邓肯对我很重要——而我无法告诉他。有一两分钟我一言不发，但我还是心存疑问。最后我说：“为什么你不告诉我米兰达的事呢？为什么这件事秘而不宣呢？这一切让我很不安。”

“我想忘掉这一切。”邓肯缓缓道来，“那段时间真是一个多事之秋。米兰达和朱丽叶都爱尼克。朱丽叶恨米兰达。她很害怕，因为米兰达想同尼克一起生活。朱丽叶告诉了我米兰达和尼克的事，因为她想让我去阻止米兰达。”

“朱丽叶告诉了我她对尼克的爱。她说，这是一个秘密。”

“一个秘密？”邓肯愤怒地笑了，“呵，米兰达始终不知道，这没错。朱丽叶很小心——她从来不提尼克。但这不难看出来。我看到过她的车停在他的农场，而且我现在经常看到她的车停在那里。”

现在，天色变得更暗了。“米兰达出事的那天晚上，朱丽叶在这儿吗？”我问。也许是朱丽叶杀了她姐姐，我想。

“不，不，朱丽叶不在，尼克也不在，”邓肯说，“我在楼上，孩子们已经上床了。当时，米兰达把我叫进了卧室，说道：‘我要离开你，邓肯。我要和尼克生活在一起。’我很生气，也很苦恼，但我跑下楼进了厨房是在她摔下来之前。凯茜，没有人杀害米兰达。那是一场意外，一场可怕的意外。”邓肯把手放在我的手臂上。“现在你还不能忘掉米兰达吗？我们能不能重新开始？”

但当时我无法回答他。

我们到了海滩屋。楼下的厨房里亮着灯，起居室的灯也亮着。

“孩子们在看电视，”邓肯说。我们进了屋，邓肯打开了起居室的门。“我们回来了，”他对孩子们说，“我们这就去厨房做晚餐。”

厨房里温暖而安静。老哈维太太坐在她的椅子里。突然，我又感到害怕起来。老哈维太太的脸色极差。我站在厨房门边，无法走进去。

“妈妈，我们回来了，”邓肯说，“凯茜和我在一起，一切都很好。”

哈维太太的眼睛在她苍白的脸上看起来暗淡无光。“我怕，邓肯！我怕！孩子们爱凯茜，你爱凯茜。我看得出来。但是凯茜爱尼克。她会离开你和孩子们。记得米兰达吧？这一切又发生了。我能看出来。”

“妈妈！这不是真的。不要这么说！”

“记得米兰达吧？”哈维太太又说了一遍。“别烦恼，邓肯。你知道，我永远在你身边。因为有关节炎，我无法照顾你，但我是最爱你的，这你知道，我又要助你一臂之力了。”

忽然间，我明白了一切。“告诉我们米兰达的事，”我轻声地说，“那天晚上你做了什么？”

哈维太太看着我。“我不希望你离开，凯茜。我希望你能和孩子们在一起，与邓肯幸福地生活。我告诉你那天晚上的事吧，”她说，“可以后你一定要待在这儿和我们在一起。”

房间里非常安静。邓肯握着我的手，他的手温暖而有力。

“米兰达想离开邓肯。我在楼上自己的房间里，听见了她说的话。邓肯跑下楼，我从自己房间里出来，和米兰达谈了谈。她恨邓肯，也不愿考虑孩子们。”哈维太太开始哭，“我推了她。她站在楼梯上，我用拐杖推了她。她从楼梯上摔了下去，我回了自己的房间。我不想杀死她，只想摔断她的腿。我希望她留在家里和邓肯在一起。但她死了，最终我很高兴，因为她没有走，去和尼克生活……”

哈维太太说啊说啊，最后我们都不听她说了。

“凯茜，一切将变得很难面对，”邓肯疲惫地说，“我必须叫警察来，告诉他们母亲的事。然后我得跟孩子们谈谈。你也将很难面对这一切。你打算离开海滩屋吗？”

我笑了。我脑子里再没有什么疑问了。现在哈维家的所有事情我都知道了：再没有什么让我害怕的了。“不，邓肯，我不会离开。”

“孩子们需要你，”他说，“你知道的。但是我也需要你。我希望你和我在一起。但这一切过后，我们能幸福吗？”

“我们当然能，”我对他说，“对我们大家而言，如今，事情正在好起来。”

他用胳膊搂着我，吻我，在他的臂弯里我找到了自己的家。

内容简介

身为侦探，必须眼观六路、耳听八方，还得记住所有细节。他们要留心天气、别人穿的鞋、女人帽子上的花、男人衣服口袋里的一盒火柴。他们必须通晓人情世故，对狗、羊和马都得有所知。甚至，他们还必须了解赛马，这项帝王的娱乐运动……

一匹著名赛马——“银光”——失踪了，歇洛克·福尔摩斯和华生医生来到了位于达特穆尔的马厩。“银光”是一周后的一场大赛的夺冠热门，它的主人罗斯先生满怀信心能赢得这场比赛。但他首先得找到自己的马。这个案子还死了一个人——约翰·斯特雷克，“银光”的驯马师。他妻子在离马厩不远的泥地里发现了他的尸体。格雷戈里巡官要找出凶手，但他与罗斯先生却得出了错误的结论。

那么，歇洛克·福尔摩斯问道，星期一晚上马厩里究竟发生 了什么事？还有，同样重要的是，没有 发生什么？

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SPORT OF KINGS

Detectives must see, hear, and remember everything. They must be interested in the weather, people's shoes, flowers in a woman's hat, a box of matches in a man's pocket. They must understand people; they must know about dogs, and sheep, and horses. They must even know about horseracing, the sport of kings...

When Silver Blaze, a famous racehorse, disappears, Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson go down to his Dartmoor stables. Silver Blaze is the favourite for a big race in a week's time, and his owner, Mr Ross, is hoping to win this race. But first, he needs to find his horse. There is also a dead man in the case — John Straker, Silver Blaze's trainer. His wife found his body in the mud not far from the stables. And Inspector Gregory needs to find the killer. But he and Mr Ross are getting the wrong answers to their questions.

So, says Sherlock Holmes, what did happen at the stables on Monday night? And, just as important, what did not happen?

1

A horse called Silver Blaze

'I must go down there, Watson. I must,' said Sherlock Holmes at the breakfast table on Thursday morning.

'Go? Go where?' I asked.

'To Dartmoor — to King's Pyland.'

'Ah! So that's it,' I said. 'Well, everybody in the country is talking about the case at King's Pyland.'

I always know when Holmes is interested in a case. He reads all the newspapers, he walks up and down, up and down the room, and does not speak for hours.

He did all those things yesterday. He did not answer any of my questions, but I knew that it was the mystery at King's Pyland.

The morning newspapers were on the breakfast table. 'What is happening at King's Pyland? Where is Silver Blaze?' they asked. 'Who killed John Straker? What are the police doing? Can they find the horse before the big race next week?'

Silver Blaze was a famous racehorse, and John Straker was his trainer. One of the biggest horse races of the year — the Wessex Cup —was next week, and Silver Blaze was the favourite to win. But on Monday night at King's Pyland two things happened. Someone killed John Straker, and Silver Blaze disappeared.

I was interested in this case too. 'Do you need my help, Holmes?' I asked. 'I would very much like to come with you.'

'My dear Watson,' said Holmes, 'of course you must come with me. We can catch the twelve o'clock from Paddington, and talk about the case on the train.'

Two hours later we were on the train to Tavistock. We read all the midday newspapers, but there was nothing new in them.

'So, Watson, what do you think about this case?'

'Well, the newspapers say —'

'Ah, yes. The newspapers understand nothing. One day they say one thing, the next day they say another. But we must look at the case more carefully. What did happen on Monday night at King's Pyland? And what did not happen? That's an important question too.'

'Do the police have any answers?' I asked.

'No,' said Holmes. 'On Wednesday morning I had two letters. One was from Mr Ross, the owner of the horse, and the other was from the Dartmoor police — an Inspector Gregory. They ask for my help.'

'Wednesday morning!' I cried. 'But this is Thursday morning. Why didn't you go down yesterday?'

'Because it was an easy case. You can't hide a famous horse for long, I thought. Where can you hide a horse on Dartmoor? There are no buildings, no trees... But I was wrong, Watson. The case is now two days old, and nobody can find the horse — or Straker's killer. So here we are, on the train to Tavistock.'

'And what do you think about it all?' I said.

'Well, Watson, let's look at the case. First, we have a racehorse, Silver Blaze — only five years old, but already a winner in many big races. His owner, Mr Ross, is a happy man — and rich. The racegoers are happy too. Silver Blaze nearly always wins his races, and so people put big bets on him to win. And when the favourite wins the race, a lot of people make money on their bets. But what happens when the favourite doesn't win, Watson? What then?'

'A lot of people lose their money, of course,' I said. 'And people with big bets on a different horse can make much more money, when that other horse wins.'

'Right, Watson! So perhaps some people are very interested in Silver Blaze not running in the Wessex Cup. Of course, Mr Ross and his trainer, John Straker, know that, and they watch the horse very carefully.

'Now, let's look at the people and the place. The trainer, John Straker — a good man and wonderful with horses — worked for Mr Ross for twelve years. There are four horses in the training stables, and three boys working for Straker. One of them sits up all night with the horses, and the other two sleep in a room over the stables. We know nothing bad about any of the boys.

'Straker has a wife, no children, and lives — I mean, lived — in a house about two hundred metres from the stables. The town of Tavistock is two kilometres to the west, and about two kilometres to the east there is Capleton, another training stables. The owner there is Lord Backwater, and the trainer is Silas Brown. There are no other houses — just the hills of Dartmoor.'

I listened carefully. I wanted to remember it all because Holmes does not like to say anything twice.

'Now,' he said, 'what happened on Monday night? These papers came with Inspector Gregory's letter. The best thing is for you to read them, Watson. Then tell me what you think.'

I took the papers from him, and began to read.

1 ．赛马“银光”

“我必须得去一趟，华生。不能不去。”星期四早上，歇洛克·福尔摩斯坐在桌旁吃早餐时说道。

“去？去哪儿？”我问道。

“去达特穆尔——去金斯皮兰。”

“啊！就是这事儿。”我说，“全英国的人都在谈论金斯皮兰的这个案子。”

当福尔摩斯对某个案子感兴趣的时候，我总能感觉到。他会浏览所有的报纸，在房间里不停地走来走去，几小时都不说话。

昨天他就是这样。我问什么他都不理，不过我知道他肯定是在想着金斯皮兰的神秘事件。

早上的报纸就放在餐桌上。“金斯皮兰发生了什么事？‘银光’在哪儿？”报上写道，“谁杀死了约翰·斯特雷克？警方在干什么？他们能不能在下星期大赛前找回‘银光’？”

“银光”是一匹著名的赛马，约翰·斯特雷克是它的驯马师。每年最大的赛马会之一——韦塞克斯杯——就在下星期举行，“银光”是夺冠的大热门。但星期一晚上，在金斯皮兰发生了两件事。约翰·斯特雷克被杀了，而“银光”失踪了。

我对这案子也很感兴趣。“你要我帮忙吗，福尔摩斯？”我问道，“我非常愿意跟你一起去。”

“亲爱的华生，”福尔摩斯说，“你当然得跟我一起去。我们可以赶12点从帕丁顿区开出的火车，在车上讨论案情。”

两个小时以后，我们坐上了去塔维斯托克的火车。我们看了中午所有的报纸，但报上没有什么新消息。

“华生，你对这案子有什么看法？”

“呃，报纸上说——”

“啊，报纸什么也不知道。他们今天说一套，明天又是一套。但我们得更用心地看待这个案子。星期一晚上在金斯皮兰发生 了什么？没 发生的又是什么？这也是个关键的问题。”

“警方找到答案了吗？”我问道。

“没有，”福尔摩斯说，“星期三早上我收到两封信，一封是马的主人罗斯先生写来的，另一封来自达特穆尔警方——格雷戈里巡官。他们请求我帮忙。”

“星期三早上！”我叫道，“但现在已经是星期四上午了。你为什么不昨天动身呢？”

“因为这个案子并不复杂。我原来以为没人能长时间地藏住一匹知名的马。你能把马藏在达特穆尔的什么地方呢？那儿没有建筑物，也没有树林……但我的判断并不准确，华生。现在这案子已经发生两天了，还没人找到那匹马——或者找到杀死约翰·斯特雷克的凶手。所以我们才坐上了这列开往塔维斯托克的火车。”

“那你对这一切有什么看法？”我问道。

“嗯，华生，我们来看看这个案子。首先，有一匹赛马‘银光’——才5岁，但已经是许多大赛的冠军。它的主人罗斯先生很开心——因为他有钱了。在这匹马上下注的赛马迷们也很开心，因为银光在比赛中几乎从未输过，因此人们在它身上下了重注。如果最被看好的赛马赢得了比赛，很多人都会凭他们下的赌注赢钱。但如果这匹马输了 呢，华生？那会怎样？”

“当然是许多人输钱啦，”我说，“而且在别的 马身上下了重注的人会赢得更多 的钱，如果被下注的那匹马赢了的话。”

“说得对，华生！所以，可能有人很希望‘银光’不能 参加韦塞克斯杯的比赛。当然，罗斯先生和他的驯马师约翰·斯特雷克知道这一点，他们非常小心地照顾着这匹马。”

“现在让我们来看看这案子涉及到的人和地点。驯马师约翰·斯特雷克——他是个好人，对马很有一套——已经为罗斯先生工作了12年了。训练用的马厩里有四匹马。斯特雷克手下有三个小马倌，其中一个会整夜守着马，另外两个睡在马厩顶上的一个房间里。就我们所知，这几个男孩儿的品行都很好。”

“斯特雷克已经结婚，没有孩子，住在——我是说，他曾经住在离马厩200米左右的一所房子里。向西两公里就是塔维斯托克镇，东边大约两公里的地方是卡普莱顿，另一处训马马厩。那儿的主人是巴克沃特勋爵，驯马师是赛拉斯·布朗。附近没有其他的房子了——只有达特穆尔的山。”

我仔细听着，想记住这一切，因为福尔摩斯不喜欢重复说过的话。

“那么，”他说道，“星期一晚上发生了什么事？这些卷宗是格雷戈里巡官随信一起寄来的。你最好看看，华生，然后告诉我你的想法。”

我从他手里拿过卷宗，看了起来。

Monday night at King's Pyland

Notes by Inspector Gregory, after talking to Edith Baxter, Ned Hunter, Mrs John Straker, and Mr Fitzroy Simpson

On Monday evening Straker locked the stables at nine o'clock, the usual time. Two of the boys then walked up to the trainer's house for their dinner, but the third boy, Ned Hunter, stayed in the stables to watch the horses. At five past nine, the Strakers' servant, a girl called Edith Baxter, carried Ned Hunter's dinner down to the stables. The dinner that night was a hot meat curry.

Edith was nearly at the stables when a man called out to her. He came up to her, and she saw a tall man in a grey suit and a hat, and a red and black scarf. He carried a big walking stick, and Edith felt afraid of him.

'Where am I?' the man asked. 'What is this place?'

'This is King's Pyland training stables,' she said.

'Good!' said the man. 'Now, a stable boy sleeps here every night — is that right? And I think you're taking his dinner to him now.' He took an envelope out of his pocket. 'Please give the boy this, and you can have some money for a beautiful new dress.'

Edith did not take the envelope. She ran past the man to the stables and up to a small open window. She always put the boy's dinner through this window, and Ned Hunter was there, ready to take it.

'Oh Ned!' Edith cried, but before she could say any more, the stranger came up behind her.

'Good evening,' he said through the window to the boy. 'I want to talk to you.'

'Who are you? What do you want?' Ned Hunter said.

'I want to make you rich, boy,' the stranger said. 'You help me, and I help you. You have two horses in for the Wessex Cup — Silver Blaze and Bayard. I hear that Bayard is the better horse, and that you stable boys are putting your bets on him to win. Am I right?'

'I'm not saying anything!' cried Ned Hunter. 'We don't talk about our horses at King's Pyiand, so get out! I'm getting the dog now!'

Ned ran across the stables to get the dog, and Edith began to run back to the house. But she looked back after about thirty metres, and saw the man at the little window, with his head and one arm inside the room.

Edith ran on, and a minute later, Ned came out of the building and locked the door behind him. He ran all round the stables with the dog, but the man was gone.

Ned Hunter told the trainer and the other boys about the stranger, but no one saw him again.

The next thing happened at one o'clock in the morning when John Straker got out of bed.

'What's the matter?' said his wife. 'Where are you going?'

'To the stables,' Straker said. 'I can't stop thinking about that stranger. I just want to have a look around.'

'But it's raining. Wait until the rain stops,' she said.

'No, no,' Straker said. 'I want to go now.'

He left the house and Mrs Straker went back to sleep. At seven in the morning she woke up, but her husband was not there. She quickly got up, called the servant, Edith, and they ran down to the stables.

They found the stables unlocked. Straker was not there, and inside, on a chair, Ned Hunter slept like a dead man. Silver Blaze was gone, and his stable door was open. They called the other two boys from the room over the stables. They were good sleepers and heard nothing in the night.

Nobody could wake Ned Hunter, so the two women and the boys ran out to look for the trainer and the horse. Five hundred metres from the stables, they saw Straker's coat on a small tree. Down the hill, just past the tree, they found the trainer. He was dead.

There was a long cut in his leg, and his head was broken in three places. In his right hand he had a small knife, with blood all over it, and in his left hand he had a red and black scarf.

Edith Baxter knew the scarf at once, and later, so did Ned Hunter.

'It's the stranger's scarf,' he told us. 'When I went to get the dog, that stranger was still at the stable window. He put something in my meat curry, to make me sleep — I know he did. Edith saw him, with his arm through the window.'

Ned Hunter was right about his meat curry. There was some of his dinner left, and we found a lot of opium in it. That's why Ned slept like a dead man.

What about the horse? We found his tracks in the mud, next to Straker's dead body. But what happened then? Someone hit Straker on the head, and killed him. Did that person take the horse away? Did the horse run away? Everybody on Dartmoor is looking for Silver Blaze, but there is no news of him.

When I began work on the case on Tuesday, we looked for the stranger. He was in Tavistock, and we found him easily. His name is Fitzroy Simpson. He lives mostly in London, and makes his money at the races, taking bets. We looked in his betting-book, and found a number of big bets — five thousand pounds — against the favourite for the Wessex Cup.

These were his answers to my questions.

'Why did you come down to Dartmoor?'

'I'm a betting man, Inspector. I need to know about the horses for the Wessex Gup — Silver Blaze, Bayard, and Desborough, the horse at Silas Brown's stables. He's the second favourite for the race, you see.'

'Did you go to the King's Pyland stables late on Monday evening?'

'Yes, I did. I just wanted to ask the stable boys some questions. They know the horses better than anyone.'

'And is this your scarf?'

'Yes... yes, it is.'

'And how did it get into the dead man's hand, Mr Simpson? Can you tell us that?'

'I don't know, Inspector, I don't know! I never saw the man. I lost my scarf in the dark. It wasn't me, Inspector, it wasn't me!'

We asked many more questions, but Fitzroy Simpson did not change his story. He was out at King's Pyland that night, his suit was still wet from the rain, and his big walking stick could break a man's head open. But there were no cuts on his body, so where did the blood on Straker's knife come from?

2 ．周一晚上的金斯皮兰

格雷戈里巡官与伊道丝·巴克斯特、内德·亨特、约翰·斯特雷克夫人以及菲茨罗伊·辛普森先生谈话以后的记录。

星期一晚上，斯特雷克跟平常一样9点就锁了马厩。然后有两个小马倌走到驯马师家里吃晚餐，而第三个小马倌内德·亨特留在马厩照看马匹。9点5分，斯特雷克的佣人，一个名叫伊迪丝·巴克斯特的女孩子把内德·亨特的晚餐送到马厩。那天晚上的晚餐是热的咖哩烧肉。

伊迪丝快到马厩的时候，一个人向她打招呼。他走近她，伊迪丝看见一个高个子男人，穿着一件灰色外套，戴着帽子，围着一条黑红相间的围巾，手里拿着一根粗大的手杖。伊迪丝觉得有点儿害怕。

“我这是在哪儿？”那个人问道，“这是什么地方？”

“这是金斯皮兰的训练马厩。”伊迪丝回答道。

“太好了！”那个人说。“那么，一个小马倌每天晚上睡在这儿——对吗？我猜你这是要去给他送晚餐吧。”他从口袋里掏出一个信封。“请把这个交给那个男孩儿，你就可以得到一笔钱买身漂亮衣服了。”

伊迪丝没拿那个信封。她从那个人身旁跑过去，跑到马厩那儿的一扇开着的小窗前。她一般都从这扇窗户将小马倌的晚餐递进去，内德·亨特已经在那儿准备取饭了。

“噢，内德！”伊迪丝叫道，但她还没来得及说别的，那个陌生人已经来到了她身后。

“晚上好，”他隔着窗户对那个男孩说，“我想跟你谈谈。”

“你是谁？你想干什么？”内德·亨特说。

“我想让你发财，孩子，”那个陌生人说，“你要是帮我，我就会帮你。你们有两匹马要参加韦塞克斯杯——‘银光’和贝亚德。我听说贝亚德更好，你们这帮小马倌都在它身上下了注。对吗？”

“我不会透露任何事！”内德·亨特叫道，“我们不会在金斯皮兰谈论自己的马，快走开！我要放狗了！”

内德穿过马厩去牵狗，伊迪丝开始回头往房子里跑。但她跑了大约30米后，回头看见那个人站在那扇小窗子边，头和一只胳膊伸进了房间里。

伊迪丝继续往回跑，很快内德就出来了，顺手锁了门。他带着狗绕马厩跑了一圈，但那个人已经不见了。

内德·亨特跟驯马师和其他的马倌说了那个陌生人的事，但再没人看到那个人。

第二件事发生在凌晨1点。约翰·斯特雷克从床上爬了起来。

“怎么了？”他妻子说，“你要去哪儿？”

“去马厩看看，”斯特雷克说，“我老想着那个陌生人。我想去看看。”

“可天在下雨呢。等雨停了再去吧。”她说。

“不，不，”斯特雷克说，“我就想现在去。”

他离开了房子，斯特雷克夫人接着睡觉。早上7点，她醒了过来，但她丈夫不在。她马上起床，叫来了佣人伊迪丝，一起往马厩跑去。

她们发现马厩没锁。斯特雷克不在，内德·亨特在里边一张椅子上睡得跟死人一样。“银光”也不见了，它所在的马厩开着门。她们叫醒了睡在马厩顶上房间里的另外两个小马倌。他俩都睡得很死，没听见夜里有任何动静。

没人能叫醒内德·亨特，于是那两个女人和两个小马倌跑出去找驯马师和那匹马。在离马厩500米的地方，他们看见斯特雷克的外套挂在一棵小树上。就在树边的山脚下，他们找到了驯马师。他死了。

他腿上有一道长长的伤口，脑袋有三处破了。他右手拿着一把小刀，上面满是血，左手拽着一条黑红相间的围巾。

伊迪丝·巴克斯特马上就认出了那条围巾，后来，内德·亨德也认出来了。

“是那个陌生人的围巾，”他告诉我们，“我去牵狗的时候，那个人还在马厩的窗户边。他放了什么东西在我的咖哩烧肉里，让我昏昏入睡——我知道一定是他。伊迪丝看见他了，他的手伸进了窗户里。”

内德·亨特关于他的咖哩烧肉的判断是对的。他的晚餐还剩下一点儿，我们在里边发现大量的麻醉剂。这就是内德睡得那么死的原因。

那匹马呢？我们在泥地里发现了它的脚印，就在斯特雷克的尸体旁边。但是随后发生了什么事？有人打中了斯特雷克的头，杀死了他。那个人把马带走了吗？还是马自己跑了？达特穆尔的每个人都在找“银光”，但没有关于它的任何消息。

星期二我开始调查这个案子，我们就着手寻找那个陌生人。他在塔维斯托克，我们轻而易举地找到了他。他名叫菲茨罗伊·辛普森。他大部分时间住在伦敦，靠在赛马中赌马赚钱。我们查看了他的赌金簿，发现他在韦塞克斯杯上下了重注——5000英镑——买 “银光 ”输 。

以下是他回答我的问题的记录。

“你为什么去达特穆尔？”

“巡官，我是个赌徒。我得了解参加韦塞克斯杯的马——‘银光’、贝亚德，还有德斯伯勒，赛拉斯·布朗家的马。你知道，那是这次比赛的第二大热门。”

“星期一晚上你是不是去了金斯皮兰的马厩？”

“对。我只想向着马厩的马倌打听点儿事情。他们比任何人都了解马的状况。”

“这是你的围巾吗？”

“对……是我的。”

“那它是怎么到被害人的手里的，辛普森先生？你能向我们解释一下吗？”

“我不知道，巡官，我不知道！我从来没见过那个人，那天夜里我的围巾丢了。不是我干的，巡官，不是我！”

我们还问了很多问题，但菲茨罗伊·辛普森坚持他的说法。他那天晚上确实在金斯皮兰，他的外套淋了雨，还是湿的，他那条粗大的手杖足以打破人的脑袋。但他身上没有伤口，那斯特雷克手里那把刀上的血迹又是从哪儿来的呢？

还有，那匹马哪儿去了？

John Straker's pockets

'Mmm, very interesting,' I said. I gave the papers back to Holmes, and he put them away.

'So, Watson, what can you tell me?' he asked.

I thought for a minute. 'This cut on Straker's leg. Perhaps he did it with his own knife. When something hits you very hard on the head, and you have a knife in your hand... It can happen, you know.'

'Very good, Watson. And that's bad news for Fitzroy Simpson.'

'So did Simpson do it, do you think?' I said.

'Perhaps,' said Holmes. 'Let's look at it. Simpson puts opium in the boy's dinner. He goes away and comes back later in the night. He gets into the stables, takes the horse out, and leaves. But the trainer arrives at that moment, sees him, and follows him. The two men fight, and Simpson breaks Straker's head open with his stick. Then Simpson takes the horse — but where? Or did the horse run away? Is it still out on the moor? And how did Simpson get into the locked stables? I don't know, Watson, I don't know. We must wait and see.'

When we arrived at Tavistock station, two men came to meet us. Inspector Gregory was a tall, slow-moving man with blue eyes, and Mr Ross was small and quick. He was the first to speak.

'Very pleased to see you, Mr Holmes. The Inspector here is working hard, but we need help. We must find poor Straker's killer, and I want to find my horse.'

'Is there any news?' asked Holmes.

'Let's talk on the way,' the Inspector said. 'I'd like you to see everything in the daylight.'

We were soon out of the little town and up on the brown hills of the moor.

Inspector Gregory thought that the killer was Fitzroy Simpson. 'Simpson was out in the rain that night. His suit was still wet on the Tuesday,' he said. 'He had a big stick, and his scarf was in the dead man's hand. That looks bad, Mr Holmes, very bad.'

Holmes smiled. 'You need more than that, Inspector. The servant, Edith, spoke of an envelope. Did Simpson say anything about that?'

'Yes, he said it had money in it — a ten-pound note for the stable boy.'

'What about this other training stables, at Capleton?' asked Holmes. 'Does Simpson have friends there?'

'No, we don't think so. We went to Capleton, of course. Their horse, Desborough, is the second favourite for the Wessex Cup, and Silas Brown, the trainer, was not friendly with Straker. But we found nothing.'

When we arrived at King's Pyland, Inspector Gregory took us into the trainer's house.

'Straker's body is upstairs,' he said. 'But we have here the things from his pockets and from the ground next to his body. Would you like to see them, Mr Holmes?'

'Very much,' said Holmes.

We went into the front room, and the Inspector opened a box and put things on a table. There was a box of matches, a small piece of candle, some money, a watch, some papers, and a small, thin knife.

'This is a strange knife,' Holmes said. He looked at it carefully, and then gave it to me. 'What is it, Watson?'

'It's an eye knife,' I said. 'Doctors use these when they cut into an eye. You don't usually see them outside a hospital.'

'Mm,' said Holmes. 'So why did Straker take this knife? It's no good for fighting.'

'His wife says it was in the bedroom for some days,' said Inspector Gregory. 'Perhaps he just took it because it was there on the table.'

'Perhaps,' said Holmes. 'What about these papers?'

'One is a letter from Mr Ross, the others are bills,' the Inspector said. 'Three of them are bills for the horses' food, and this one is a bill from a dress-maker in London, for a Mr William Darbyshire. He was a friend of Straker's, his wife tells us. His letters sometimes came here, and Straker sent them on.'

'Mrs William Darbyshire is an expensive lady,' said Holmes, looking at the bill. 'Twenty-five pounds is a lot of money, for just one dress and one hat.' He put the bill down and moved to the window. 'Inspector, can we go out on the moor now, before the light begins to go?'

We left the room and at the front door we saw a woman. She came up to Inspector Gregory and put her hand on his arm. 'Is there any news?' she said.

'No, Mrs Straker, but here is Mr Holmes, the famous detective from London. We have him to help us now.'

'I think I met you a month or two ago, Mrs Straker,' said Holmes. 'Let me see... Yes, it was in Plymouth, at a garden-party. Do you remember?'

'No, sir. That wasn't me.'

'But I remember so well... You had a blue dress, and a dark blue hat with white flowers on it.'

'I don't have a hat with flowers on it, sir,' Mrs Straker said.

'Well, well, I am wrong, then. I am so sorry.' And with that Holmes followed the Inspector outside. The four of us then walked past the stables and up onto the moor. After ten minutes Inspector Gregory stopped.

'Here we are,' he said. 'Straker's body was just down there. His coat was here, on this small tree —'

'On the tree? Not on the ground?' Holmes asked.

'Oh no. It was on the tree, carefully away from the mud on the ground.'

'Mmm. Interesting,' said Holmes. 'Now, I must look at the mud down there.'

'Ah,' said Inspector Gregory, 'and to help you, I have here in this bag one of Straker's shoes, one of Fitzroy Simpson's shoes, and one of Silver Blaze's horseshoes.'

'My dear Inspector, well done!' Holmes was very pleased. 'You think of everything.'

For some minutes Holmes looked carefully at the ground, his eyes only centimetres away from the mud.

'Hello!' he said suddenly. 'What's this?' From out of the mud he took a match, or a small piece of one.

'Now why didn't I find that?' said the Inspector.

'I knew it was there, you see,' said Holmes.

'You knew ? But how could you know that?'

Holmes smiled but did not answer. He then took the shoes, got down on the ground, and began to look at all the tracks in the mud. We stood and watched him, but after five minutes Mr Ross looked at his watch.

'Er, this is very interesting, Mr Holmes,' he said, 'but is it going to take a long time?'

'No,' said Holmes. He got to his feet. 'I don't need to do any more here. Watson and I are going to take a little walk across the moor now, with the horseshoe.'

Mr Ross looked at the Inspector. 'Can we go back to the house and talk? I must take Silver Blaze's name out of the Wessex Cup race — and do it today, I think.'

'Don't do that!' cried Holmes. 'No, no, you must leave the horse's name in for the race.'

'But...' Mr Ross began. Then he laughed, a little angrily. 'Well, thank you, Mr Holmes. Thank you for your help. See you later then, at the house.'

And he and the Inspector walked away.

3 ．约翰·斯特雷克的口袋

“嗯，很有意思，”我说。我把卷案还给福尔摩斯，他将它们收了起来。

“那么，华生，你有什么看法？”他问。

我想了想。“斯特雷克腿上的那个伤口没准是他自己的刀划的。如果有什么东西猛撞你的头，你手上又正好拿着把刀……你知道，很有可能。”

“很好，华生。这对菲茨罗伊·辛普森来说可不是个好消息。”

“那你觉得是辛普森干的吗？”我问道。

“有可能。”福尔摩斯说，“让我们想想，辛普森在那个小马倌的晚餐里下了麻醉剂。他先离开，夜里晚些时候又回来，进入马厩，把马牵出来，然后逃走。但那时驯马师刚好赶到，看见了他，并紧追不舍。两个人打了起来，辛普森用手杖把斯特雷克的头打开了花。然后辛普森带走了那匹马——但带到哪里去了？还是马自己跑了？它是不是还在高沼地里？还有，辛普森怎么进到上了锁 的马厩里的？我不知道，华生，我不知道。我们必须等等看。”

我们到塔维斯托克车站时，有两个人来接我们。格雷戈里巡官个子高高的，动作缓慢，有一双蓝色的眼睛。罗斯先生是小个子，性子很急。他首先开口。

“福尔摩斯先生，很高兴见到你。这位巡官很卖力，但我们需要帮助。我们必须找出杀害可怜的斯特雷克的凶手，我还想找到我的马。”

“有什么新的消息吗？”福尔摩斯问道。

“我们在路上说吧，”巡官说，“我想让你趁白天看看所有的情况。”

我们很快就出了小镇，到了沼泽地里的棕色小山上。

格雷戈里巡官认为凶手就是菲茨罗伊·辛普森。“那天晚上下雨的时候辛普森在外面。他的外套到星期二还是湿的，”他说，“他有一根粗大的手杖，他的围巾又在死者手里。看上去不妙，福尔摩斯先生，非常不妙。”

福尔摩斯笑了笑。“你还需要更多证据，巡官。那个佣人，伊迪丝，提到了一个信封。辛普森对此说了什么吗？”

“说了，他说里边有钱——一张十英镑的钞票，给小马倌的。”

“卡普莱顿的另一个训练马厩情形怎么样？”福尔摩斯问道，“辛普森在那儿有没有什么朋友？”

“没有，我们以为没有。当然，我们也去了卡普莱顿。他们的马，德斯伯勒，是韦塞克斯杯的第二大热门，驯马师赛拉斯·布朗跟斯特雷克关系不好。但我们没发现什么。”

我们到达金斯皮兰以后，格雷戈里巡官把我们带到驯马师的家里。

“斯特雷克的尸体在楼上，”他说，“但我们把他口袋里的东西，还有在他身边地上找到的东西放在这儿。你想看看吗，福尔摩斯先生？”

“很想。”福尔摩斯说。

我们走进前厅，巡官打开一个盒子，把里边的东西放到一张桌子上。有一盒火柴，一小段蜡烛，一些钱，一块表，几张纸，还有一把很薄的小刀。

“这把刀很奇怪，”福尔摩斯说。他仔细地看了看，然后把刀递给我。“这是什么，华生？”

“这是一把眼科手术刀，”我说，“医生给眼睛动手术的时候就用这样的刀。一般在医院外面见不到这样的刀。”

“嗯，”福尔摩斯说，“那斯特雷克拿这刀做什么呢？它并不适合打斗。”

“他妻子说这把刀在卧室里已经放了一段时间了，”格雷戈里巡官说，“也许只是因为它在桌子上，他就顺手拿了。”

“也许，”福尔摩斯说，“那些纸是什么？”

“一张是罗斯先生的信，其他的是账单，”巡官说，“其中有三张是马饲料的账单，这张是伦敦的一个裁缝寄来的账单，是给一个名叫威廉·达比希雷的人的。斯特雷克的妻子告诉我们，他是斯特雷克的朋友。有时他的信会寄到这儿，斯特雷克再转寄出去。”

“威廉·达比希雷夫人是位出手阔绰的女士，”福尔摩斯看着账单说，“一件衣服和一顶帽子就花了25英镑，这可是一大笔钱呢。”他放下账单，走到窗户边。“巡官，趁着天色还没暗下去，我们能现在去高沼地吗？”

我们离开了房间。在大门口，我们看见一个女人。她走向格雷戈里巡官，拉住他的手臂。“有什么消息吗？”她问。

“没有，斯特雷克夫人，不过福尔摩斯先生在这儿，他是伦敦来的著名侦探。我们现在有他帮忙了。”

“我想一两个月前我曾经见过你，斯特雷克夫人。”福尔摩斯说，“让我想想……对，是在普利茅斯的一个游园会上。你还记得吗？”

“没有，先生，那不是我。”

“但我记得很清楚……你穿着蓝色的衣服，戴着一顶深蓝色的帽子，上面有白色的花。”

“我没有上面带花的帽子，先生。”斯特雷克夫人说。

“哦，那是我记错了。对不起。”福尔摩斯说着，跟着巡官出了门。然后，我们四个人经过马厩，走到高沼地上。十分钟后，格雷戈里巡官停了下来。

“就是这儿，”他说，“斯特雷克的尸体就在这儿，他的外套在这边，挂在这棵小树上——”

“在树上？不在地上？”福尔摩斯问道。

“哦，不是。是在树上，小心地避开了地上的泥泞。”

“嗯，真有意思，”福尔摩斯说，“现在，我必须看看那边的泥地。”

“啊，”格雷戈里巡官说，“为了协助你，我在这个包里装了一只斯特雷克的鞋，一只菲茨罗伊的鞋，还有一只‘银光’的蹄铁。”

“亲爱的巡官，太棒了！”福尔摩斯非常高兴。“你考虑得真周到。”

福尔摩斯仔细地检查了地面足足几分钟，他的眼睛离泥地只有几厘米。

“噢！”他突然说道，“这是什么？”他从泥里捡起一根火柴，或者说是一小截火柴棍。

“我怎么就没发现呢？”巡官说。

“我知道它会在这儿，你瞧。”福尔摩斯说。

“你知道 ？但你怎么可能知道呢？”

福尔摩斯笑了笑，但没回答。然后他拿起那些鞋，趴在地上，开始查看地上所有的痕迹。我们站在那儿看着他，但五分钟后，罗斯先生看了看表。

“呃，这很有意思，福尔摩斯先生，”他说，“但是不是还要很长时间？”

“不会。”福尔摩斯说。他站了起来。“我不用再在这儿做什么了。现在华生和我要在高沼地里走走，带着这块马蹄铁。”

罗斯先生看着巡官，“我们能回房子里谈谈吗？我得把‘银光’的名字从韦塞克斯杯的参赛名单里撤下来——我想，今天就得这么做。”

“别那么做！”福尔摩斯叫道，“不，不，你必须把马的名字留在参赛名单里。”

“但是……”罗斯先生开了个头，然后有点儿恼火地笑了起来。“啊，谢谢，福尔摩斯先生。谢谢你的帮助。那就过一会儿在家里见。”

然后他跟巡官一起走了。

Looking for a horse

Holmes and I walked slowly across the moor. In the evening sunlight the autumn colours on the hills were beautiful — reds and browns and yellows.

But Holmes saw nothing of that. 'So, Watson,' he said, 'let's forget John Straker for a minute, and think about the horse. Horses are friendly animals. Let's say that Silver Blaze runs away after the killing. Here he is, out on the cold wet moor. What does he do next?'

'He looks for a nice warm stable,' I said, 'with food and water.'

'Right, Watson. He didn't go back to King's Pyland, we know that, but there is another stable not far away, at Capleton. Perhaps he went there. And the way to Capleton, Watson, is down. this hill. Let's go!'

We walked quickly down the hill, and at the bottom we found a small river and some very wet ground.

'Wonderful,' said Holmes. 'I wanted mud, and here it is. You follow the left side of the river, Watson. We're looking for the tracks of horseshoes.'

We found them after only fifty metres. Holmes took the horseshoe out of his pocket and put it next to the tracks. 'Yes, that's Silver Blaze, no question about it.'

We followed the tracks easily, then lost them for a time, but found them again about two hundred metres from the Capleton stables.

'Here they are,' I cried. 'And look—there's another track here, of a man's shoe.'

Holmes got down to look. 'You're right, Watson. And the man is walking next to the horse.'

We followed the two tracks to Capleton stables, and were still twenty metres away when a man came out and called to us. He had a red, angry face.

'Go away! We don't want visitors here! Go away!'

'Mr Silas Brown?' Holmes said to him.

'What do you want?' said the man. 'I don't talk to newspaper people, so just go away.'

'We are not from a newspaper,' said Holmes, smiling. 'But you have a horse called Silver Blaze in your stable.'

'That's not true!' Mr Brown said angrily.

'Shall we go in and talk about it?' said Holmes. He did not wait for an answer, but took the man's arm and moved quickly to the gate. He looked back at me and said quietly, 'Wait for me here, Watson.'

Twenty minutes later they came out again. Holmes looked pleased, and Mr Silas Brown was a different man. He looked smaller and older, and his face was afraid.

'Remember,' said Holmes, 'you must be there on the day, on time, and everything must be ready.'

'Yes, yes,' Silas Brown said quickly. 'You can be sure of it. Oh yes, you can be sure of it.'

'Good,' said Holmes. 'Well, goodbye for now.'

Holmes and I then began to walk back to King's Pyland along the road.

'Does he have the horse, then?' I asked.

Holmes laughed. 'Yes. He said no at first, of course, but he's afraid of the police. He doesn't want them to know about this, and I can help him with that.'

'But why didn't the police find the horse?' I asked. 'Inspector Gregory said they went to Capleton.'

'Oh, it's easy to change the colour of a horse's coat.' Holmes laughed again. 'Gregory is a good policeman, But I don't think he knows much about horses.'

'And why did Brown tell you ?' I said.

'When I walked through the stables with him,' said Holmes, 'the ground was muddy and I saw the tracks of his shoes in the mud. You remember those tracks on the moor? Well, these were the same shoes. After that, it was easy, and he told me everything. He found Silver Blaze on the moor early in the morning and brought him into the stables. The horse is very well, just a different colour at the moment. Brown put a very big bet on Desborough to win the Wessex Cup, you see. And with Silver Blaze out of the race...'

'But why did you leave the horse there? Is it safe with him?' I did not understand Holmes's plan.

'My dear Watson,' Holmes said, 'the horse is very safe. Silas Brown is afraid of me, afraid of the police, afraid of losing everything. Silver Blaze must be ready to race next week, or Brown's life as a racehorse trainer is finished — and Brown knows that.'

'Mr Ross isn't going to like it,' I said.

'Mr Ross,' said Holmes, 'doesn't understand detective work. He wants answers today, now, at once. So, he must learn a lesson. He must learn to wait. Say nothing about Silver Blaze for the moment, Watson.'

Back at King's Pyland, we found Mr Ross and Inspector Gregory in the trainer's house.

'An interesting visit,' said Holmes. 'But my friend and I must go back to London by the midnight train.'

The Inspector and Mr Ross stared at him, and I saw that Holmes was right about Mr Ross.

'So our famous London detective can't find poor Straker's killer,' Mr Ross said. 'Or my horse.'

'It's a difficult case, that's true,' said Holmes quietly. 'But your horse is going to run in the Wessex Cup next Tuesday. You have my promise on that.'

'Hm! A promise is a wonderful thing,' said Mr Ross. 'But I would like the horse better than a promise.'

Holmes smiled, then turned to Inspector Gregory. 'Inspector, can you give me a photograph of Straker?'

'Yes, of course,' said the Inspector. He took one from an envelope in his pocket and gave it to Holmes.

It was now time to go back to Tavistock, and we went outside. One of the stable boys was there, and Holmes suddenly spoke to him.

'I see you have some sheep here, next to the stables,' he said. 'Are they all well?'

'They're all right, sir,' said the boy, 'but two or three of them are a little lame. They went lame last week.'

Holmes was very pleased about this. He got into the carriage and said to the Inspector, 'Remember the lame sheep, Gregory, remember the lame sheep!'

Mr Ross was not interested in the sheep, but the Inspector stared at Holmes. 'You think the sheep are important?'

'Oh yes,' said Holmes. 'Very important.'

The Inspector still stared at him, very interested now. 'And what other things are important, Mr Holmes?'

'The strange incident of the dog in the night-time.'

'The dog did nothing in the night-time.'

'That was the strange incident.'

4 ．寻找赛马

福尔摩斯和我慢慢穿过高沼地。夕阳下，山上的秋色非常美——红色、棕色、黄色交相辉映。

但福尔摩斯对此视而不见。“那么，华生，”他说，“让我们暂时忘记斯特雷克，想想那匹马吧。马是温顺的动物。我们假设‘银光’在斯特雷克被杀之后跑了。它跑到这又湿又冷的高沼地上，然后会怎么办呢？”

“它会寻找一处温暖的马厩，”我说，“一个有食有水的地方。”

“对，华生。它没回到金斯皮兰，我们知道这一点，但离这儿不远的地方还有一个马厩，在卡普莱顿。没准它去那儿了。华生，去卡普莱顿的路就是从这儿下山。我们走！”

我们很快下了山，在山脚下，我们发现一条小河，还有一片很湿的地面。

“太好了，”福尔摩斯说，“我正想有块泥地，它就出现了。华生，你沿着河的左岸走。我们找找马蹄铁的痕迹。”

就在50米远的地方，我们发现了马蹄铁的印子。福尔摩斯从口袋里拿出那块马蹄铁，放在那个蹄印的旁边。“没错，这就是‘银光’，毫无疑问。”

我们轻松地追踪着蹄印，有一会儿又失去了它的踪迹，但在离卡普莱顿马厩大约200米的地方，又发现了蹄印。

“在这儿，”我叫道，“看——这儿还有个印记，是一个人的鞋印。”

福尔摩斯蹲下查看。“你说得对，华生。而且这个人是走在马旁边的。”

我们随着二者的脚印一直到了卡普莱顿的马厩。当我们离马厩还有20米远时，一个人出来朝我们大吼。他满脸通红，怒火万丈。

“走开！我们这儿不欢迎游客！走开！”

“赛拉斯·布朗先生？”福尔摩斯对他说道。

“你们想干什么？”那个人问，“我不接受记者采访，赶快走开。”

“我们不是报社的记者，”福尔摩斯微笑着说，“但你的马厩里有一匹名叫‘银光’的马。”

“那不可能！”布朗先生愤怒地说。

“我们能进去谈谈吗？”福尔摩斯说。他没有等着那人回答，而是抓住他的胳膊，快步走向大门。他回头看看我，从容地说：“华生，在这儿等我。”

20分钟后，他们又出来了。福尔摩斯看上去很满意，赛拉斯·布朗先生完全变了个人。他看上去矮了些，也老了些，脸上满是惊恐。

“记住，”福尔摩斯说道，“到那天你一定得准时到，准备好一切。”

“好的，好的，”赛拉斯·布朗连忙说，“你放心吧。好的，你放心。”

“那好，”福尔摩斯说，“那先再见吧。”

福尔摩斯与我开始沿着大路走回金斯皮兰。

“那他藏着那匹马吗？”我问道。

福尔摩斯大笑起来。“没错。他一开始当然说没有。但他害怕警察。他不想让他们知道这件事，而我能帮他应付。”

“但警方为什么没发现那匹马呢？”我问道，“格雷戈里巡官说他们去过卡普莱顿。”

“哦，要改变一匹马的毛色很容易，”福尔摩斯再次大笑起来。“格雷戈里是个好警察，但我认为他对马了解不深。”

“那布朗为什么要告诉你 呢？”我说。

“当我跟他一起穿过马厩的时候，”福尔摩斯说，“地上有很多泥，我看见了他留在泥地上的鞋印。你还记得高沼地里的脚印吗？两种鞋印是一样的。然后就简单了，他把一切都告诉了我。那天清早，他在高沼地里发现了‘银光’，就把它带回了自己的马厩。那匹马很好，只不过现在是另一个颜色。你知道，布朗下了重注，赌德斯伯勒能赢得韦塞克斯杯。如果‘银光’不参加比赛的话……”

“但你为什么要把马留在那儿呢？它在他那儿安全吗？”我不明白福尔摩斯的想法。

“亲爱的华生，”福尔摩斯说，“那匹马很安全。赛拉斯·布朗害怕我，害怕警察，害怕失去一切。‘银光’一定要参加下周的比赛，否则布朗作为赛马训练师的生涯就完蛋了——布朗明白这一点。”

“罗斯先生不会喜欢这样的。”我说。

“罗斯先生，”福尔摩斯说，“不了解侦探工作。他想今天、现在、立刻就得到答案。因此，他必须得到点儿教训。他得学会等。暂时不要透露关于‘银光’的事情，华生。”

我们回到金斯皮兰，发现罗斯先生和格雷戈里巡官都在驯马师家里。

“这是一次很有意思的拜访，”福尔摩斯说，“但我的朋友和我必须乘午夜的火车返回伦敦。”

巡官和罗斯先生瞪着他，我发现福尔摩斯对罗斯先生的判断是对的。

罗斯先生说道：“这么说我们著名的伦敦大侦探找不到杀死可怜的斯特雷克的凶手，也找不到我的马。”

“不错，这个案子很复杂。”福尔摩斯平静地说，“但你的马会参加下星期二的韦塞克斯杯。这一点我敢保证。”

“哼！保证真是妙不可言，”罗斯先生说，“但我更想要回我的马，不想要什么保证。”

福尔摩斯笑了，然后转向格雷戈里巡官。“巡官，能不能给我一张斯特雷克的照片？”

“当然可以。”巡官说。他从口袋里的一个信封内掏出一张照片，递给福尔摩斯。

该回塔维斯托克了，我们走到屋外。有一个小马倌在外面，福尔摩斯突然跟他说起话来。

“我看见你们在这儿养了几只羊，在马厩旁边，”他说，“它们还好吗？”

“它们很好，先生，”小马倌说，“但其中两三只有点儿跛。它们上星期开始跛的。”

福尔摩斯对此非常高兴。他上了马车，对巡官说道：“记住那些跛脚的羊，格雷戈里，记住那些跛脚的羊！”

罗斯先生对羊一点儿兴趣都没有，但巡官盯着福尔摩斯。“你觉得那些羊很重要？”

“对。”福尔摩斯说，“非常重要。”

巡官还瞪着他，马上就来了兴致。“那你觉得还有什么东西很重要，福尔摩斯先生？”

“狗在那天晚上的奇怪举动。”

“那天晚上狗什么举动都没有。”

“这就是奇怪的地方。”

A day at the races

On Tuesday Holmes and I took the train to Winchester, and Mr Ross met us at the station. He drove us to the races, but he was not a happy man.

'Well, Mr Holmes,' he said coldly. 'Do you have news of my horse?'

Holmes smiled. 'He's safe and well, I'm sure. How is the betting for the Wessex Cup?'

'Very strange,' said Mr Ross. 'Yesterday Silver Blaze was fifteen to one, but today he's the favourite, at three to one. Why, I don't know.'

'Ah!' said Holmes. 'Somebody knows something!'

We arrived only minutes before the beginning of the Wessex Cup race. This was Holmes's plan, I think. Mr Ross had no time to ask questions. There were six horses running in the race, and Silver Blaze's name was there, at number 4. The horses began to come out for the race, and Mr Ross got very excited.

'Where is he? I can't see him!' he cried.

'There are two more horses to come out,' I said. 'And look! There's number 4 now, in racing colours of red and blue. Those are your colours, Mr Ross.'

And there was Silver Blaze, a big brown horse with a white nose. He came past us, looking strong and well, and ready for anything.

'Holmes,' cried Mr Ross, 'I was wrong about you! I'm sorry. But why, how — ?'

'Shh!' said Holmes. 'Watch! Yes, they're off!'

It was a good race, fast and exciting. After the first minute, a horse with yellow racing colours came to the front, and stayed there.

'That's Desborough, from the Capleton stables,' said Holmes. 'A good horse, but Silver Blaze is better.'

But Silver Blaze was three horses behind Desborough.

'Come on, come on!' cried Mr Ross. 'Move up now!'

We all watched the red and blue colours. 'Yes!' I said. 'Look, he's moving up now! Watch him go!'

Slowly but surely, Silver Blaze moved up into fourth place, then into third place, then into second place. Now only Desborough was in front of him.

'That's my boy!' said Mr Ross. 'Go on, go on!'

'Desborough's getting tired,' Holmes said. 'Watch!'

Eighty metres, fifty metres... 'He's away!' cried Mr Ross. 'His nose is in front, yes, yes, he's going to do it!'

And he did. Silver Blaze kept his nose in front, finished first, and won the Wessex Cup.

'Wonderful!' said Mr Ross. 'Wonderful! What a race! What a horse! Mr Holmes, how can I thank you?'

'You must thank the horse, not me,' said Holmes, smiling. 'Let's go down and have a look at him.'

Silver Blaze was still excited by his big race. Mr Ross looked him up and down. 'He looks well, very well. I don't understand any of it, Mr Holmes. How did you do it? Where did you find him? And perhaps you now have John Straker's killer too. Do you?'

'Yes,' said Holmes quietly. 'Yes, I have him too.'

Mr Ross and I stared at him. 'You have him?' Mr Ross said. 'Where is he?'

'He is here.'

'Here! Where?'

'Here with me now, at this moment.'

Mr Ross's face began to go red. 'What are you saying, Mr Holmes?' he said angrily. 'Are you saying —?'

Sherlock Holmes Laughed. 'No, no, Mr Ross, not you . The killer is standing behind us.'

He turned and put his hand on Silver Blaze's back.

'The horse?' cried Mr Ross.

'The horse!' I said.

'Yes, the horse,' said Holmes. 'But don't be angry with him. You can hear all about the mystery, but later, please. I have a little bet on a horse in the next race, and I would like to see it win...'

5 ．比赛日

到了星期二，福尔摩斯和我乘火车去了温切斯特，罗斯先生在车站接我们。他赶车送我们去赛场，但他的情绪不高。

“呃，福尔摩斯先生，”他冷冷地说，“你有我的马的消息吗？”

福尔摩斯笑了。“我确信它很安全，而且状况良好。现在韦塞克斯杯的赌注怎样？”

“很奇怪，”罗斯先生说，“昨天‘银光’还是15比1，今天又成了大热门，变成了3比1。唉，我真不明白。”

“啊！”福尔摩斯说，“一定是有人知道了什么消息。”

我们刚好在韦塞克斯杯开赛前几分钟赶到。我猜这是福尔摩斯的计划。这样罗斯先生就没时间问什么问题。一共有六匹马参加比赛，“银光”的名字也在，是4号。赛马开始出场准备比赛了，罗斯先生激动起来。

“它在哪儿？我没看见它！”他叫道。

“还有两匹马没出来，”我说，“看！现在出来的是4号，比赛服装是红色和蓝色。罗斯先生，那是你的颜色。”

“银光”就在那儿，那是一匹棕色的高头大马，鼻子是白色的。它经过我们面前，看上去身强体壮，气色很好，好像什么都难不倒它。

“福尔摩斯，”罗斯先生叫道，“我错怪你了！对不起，但是，你怎么——”

“嘘！”福尔摩斯说，“看！好的，他们出发了！”

这场比赛很精彩，紧张激烈，扣人心弦。比赛开始后一分钟，一匹身披黄色比赛服的马冲到了最前面，并一直保持领先。

“那是德斯伯勒，卡普莱顿马厩的马。”福尔摩斯说，“这匹马很不错，不过‘银光’更棒。”

但“银光”还在德斯伯勒身后的三匹马后面。

“快，快！”罗斯先生大叫，“快赶上去！”

我们都注视着那片红蓝相间的颜色。“好！”我说，“看，它赶上来了！看它赶上来了！”

“银光”稳稳地赶到了第四名的位置，然后是第三名，然后是第二。现在，只有德斯伯勒在它前面了。

“真是好样儿的！”罗斯先生说，“加油，加油！”

“德斯伯勒没力气了，”福尔摩斯说，“看！”

80米，50米……“他超过去了！”罗斯先生大喊，“它的鼻子在前面了，是的，是的，它就要赢了！”

它的确成功了。“银光”保持鼻子在先超出德斯伯勒，首先到达终点，赢得了韦塞克斯杯。

“太好了！”罗斯先生说，“太好了！这场比赛太精彩了！这匹马太棒了！福尔摩斯先生，我该怎么谢你才好呢？”

“你得谢谢那匹马，不用谢我。”福尔摩斯微笑着说，“我们下去看看它吧。”

“银光”还在为这场刚刚结束的大赛激动不已。罗斯先生上下打量着它。“它看上去很好，好极了。我一点儿也不明白，福尔摩斯先生。你是怎么做到的？你在哪儿找到它的？你现在多半也已经抓到了杀害约翰·斯特雷克的凶手。对吗？”

“对。”福尔摩斯平静地说，“对，我也抓到他了。”

罗斯先生和我都盯着他。“你抓到他了？”罗斯先生说，“他在哪儿？”

“他在这儿。”

“这儿！哪儿？”

“现在就在这儿，跟我在一起。”

罗斯先生的脸涨红了。“你在说些什么，福尔摩斯先生？”他愤怒地说，“你是指——”

歇洛克·福尔摩斯大笑起来。“不，不，罗斯先生，不是你 。凶手站在我们身后。”

他转过身，把手放在“银光”的背上。

“这匹马？”罗斯先生叫道。

“这匹马！”我说。

“对，就是这匹马，”福尔摩斯说。“但别怪它。你会听到所有的秘密，但得晚些。下一场比赛我在一匹马身上下了注，我想看着它赢……”

Holmes has the answers

On the train back to London Holmes told us the story behind the mystery, and the time went very quickly.

'Before we went down to King's Pyland,' my friend began, 'I thought it was Fitzroy Simpson. But when we arrived at the stables, I suddenly remembered the hot meat curry. Why didn't I think of it before? That, you see, was the beginning.'

'The meat curry...' said Mr Ross, thinking about it. 'Er, how did the meat curry help you?'

'Do you know the taste of opium?' Holmes said. 'No? Well, it's not a very strong taste, but it's there. You can taste it in most food, but not in curry. Curry has a very strong taste, stronger than opium. So the killer says, "I need a night when the dinner is a meat curry. Then Ned Hunter can eat his dinner happily, without the taste of opium — and go to sleep." But did Fitzroy Simpson know that curry was the dinner on Monday night? Of course not. How could he? He didn't make the dinner, he was a stranger at King's Pyland, he knew nobody in the trainer's house. So, we forget Simpson, and think again. Who knew about the curry before dinner on that Monday night?'

'John Straker and his wife,' I said. 'And the servant.'

'Right, Watson. And so on to the next question, about the dog. We know there was a dog in the stables that night because Ned Hunter took the dog out when Simpson was there. Then in the middle of the night someone went into the stables and took out a horse. The two boys sleeping upstairs in the stables heard nothing, because there was nothing to hear. The dog did not bark . Why not?'

'Aha!' said Mr Ross. 'It didn't bark, because it knew the visitor. Dogs only bark at strangers.'

'Right again. So, the midnight visitor was John Straker. But why did he take the horse out? What did he want? It was something dishonest, or why did he put opium in his stable boy's dinner? We all know about dishonest trainers. They can make a lot of money — they put big bets against their own horse, and then stop their horse winning. But how? What was Straker's plan here? Perhaps the answer was in his pockets, I thought.'

'And so it was. You remember the strange knife? Dr Watson here told us about it — an eye knife, used by doctors in hospitals. With a knife like this, you can make a cut — a very, very small cut — in the tendon of a horse's back leg. Nobody can see the cut, and the horse only feels it a little. He's not lame, but he doesn't run his best, so he cannot win the race.'

'And Straker wanted to do this to my horse?' cried Mr Ross. 'How could he? I thought he was a good man!'

'No,' said Holmes. 'He wasn't a good man — or a careful one. No horse stands quietly when a knife goes into its back leg. Straker didn't want anyone to hear the noise, so he took the horse out onto the moor.'

'The candle, and the match,' I said. 'Of course!'

'That's right,' Holmes said. 'And I learnt more from Straker's pockets too. You are a man of the world, Mr Ross. Do men carry other men's bills around in their pockets? No, they do not. So who was Mr Darbyshire? Another name for John Straker. And there was a lady in the case, too. A very expensive lady. I talked to Mrs Straker about the dress and the hat on the bill, but she knew nothing about them.'

'And on Monday night, out on the moor,' said Mr Ross, 'what happened, do you think?'

'How about this?' said Holmes. 'Straker takes the horse down the hill. He sees Simpson's scarf on the ground, and takes it with him — why, I don't know. He puts his coat on a tree, gets out the candle and the matches, and the knife, and begins his work. But Silver Blaze doesn't like it. Perhaps he's afraid, perhaps he feels something is wrong. He's a big strong horse, and he gets angry. He kicks out with his back legs, and the horseshoes hit Straker on the head. Straker goes down, into the mud, and the knife in his hand goes into his own leg. The horse disappears into the night.'

'Wonderful!' Mr Ross said. 'You tell it very well, Mr Holmes. I see it all now.'

'And the sheep?' I asked. 'What about the sheep? You told Inspector Gregory that they were important.'

'Ah yes, Watson, the sheep.' Holmes smiled. 'And they were important. It's not easy to make a very small cut in an animal's tendon, and Straker did not want to get it wrong. He needed to practise first, but what on? There were his own sheep, right in front of him.'

'And where did you go in London, the day after we got back?' I asked. 'Was it to that dress-maker on the bill for Mr Darbyshire?'

'Very good, Watson!' Holmes laughed. 'Yes, I had a photograph of Straker, and the dress-maker knew him at once. "Oh yes," she said, "that's Mr Darbyshire. I do a lot of work for him. Mrs Darbyshire is a very beautiful lady, and she likes expensive dresses." ' Holmes laughed again. 'It's an old, old story. Straker is not the first man with two women in his life. He needed more money for the expensive Mrs Darbyshire, so he thought of this plan with Silver Blaze. And there you have it, Mr Ross.'

'Yes, I understand it all now,' said Mr Ross, 'and thank you very much, Mr Holmes. There's just one thing. Where was the horse?'

'Ah, yes. The horse was safe and well, and with a friend,' said Sherlock Holmes. 'I can't tell you who or where, because I made a promise. But here we are, nearly in London. You have the answer to the mystery, Mr Ross, you are the winner of the Wessex Cup, and the owner of the fastest racehorse in the south of England. What more do you need?'

6 ．福尔摩斯的答案

在回伦敦的火车上，福尔摩斯给我们讲了这个谜后面的事情真相，不知不觉时间过得飞快。

“我们去金斯皮兰之前，”我的朋友开口说道，“我以为是菲茨罗伊·辛普森干的。但当我们走到马厩那儿的时候，我突然想起那些热的咖哩烧肉。在这之前我怎么没想到这个呢？瞧，这就是事件的开端……”

“咖哩烧肉……”罗斯先生说着，回想了一下。“呃，咖哩烧肉对你有什么启发？”

“你知道麻醉剂的味道吗？”福尔摩斯说，“不知道？呃，那种味道不怎么浓烈，但能感觉到。大多数食物里放了麻醉剂都能尝出来，但在咖哩里尝不出来。咖哩味道很浓，比麻醉剂味道还重。所以凶手说：‘我需要找个吃咖哩烧肉的晚上，这样内德·亨特就会愉快地享受晚餐，不会尝出麻醉剂的味道——然后就睡着了。’但菲茨罗伊·辛普森知道星期一晚上的晚餐是咖哩吗？当然不知道。他怎么能知道呢？晚餐又不是他做的。他不是金斯皮兰人，也不认识驯马师家里的任何人。所以，我们排除了辛普森，开始重新思考。星期一晚上，谁在晚饭前 就知道有咖哩呢？”

“约翰·斯特雷克和他妻子，”我说，“还有那个佣人。”

“没错，华生。然后是下一个问题，关于狗的。我们知道那天晚上马厩里有一条狗，因为辛普森在的时候内德·亨特把狗牵出来了。然后深夜里有人进了马厩，牵走了一匹马。睡在马厩楼上的两个小马倌没听到动静，因为根本就没什么动静。狗没有叫 。为什么没叫呢？”

“啊哈！”罗斯先生说，“狗没叫是因为它认识 来的人。狗只对着生人叫。”

“又说对了。也就是说，深夜来的人就是约翰·斯特雷克。但他为什么要把马带出去呢？他想干什么？肯定是什么不光彩的事，不然他为什么要在自己的马倌的饭里下麻醉剂？我们都知道有些不老实的驯马师，他们能赚很多钱——他们下重注赌自己的马输 ，然后阻止自己的马赢得比赛。但怎么做呢？斯特雷克的计划是什么？我想，答案没准就在他的口袋里。

“确实如此。你还记得那把奇怪的小刀吗？这位华生医生告诉了我们那是什么——一把眼科手术刀，是医院里的医生用的。你可以用这样一把刀制造一个伤口——一个非常非常小的伤口——在马的后腿肌腱上。没人会看见这个伤口，马也只有一点点感觉。马不会瘸，但不能发挥最好的水平，这样就无法赢得比赛。”

“斯特雷克想用这种手段 对付我的马？”罗斯先生叫道，“他怎么能这样？我原以为他是个好人！”

“不，”福尔摩斯说，“他不是好人——也不是个小心的人。当一把刀刺进后腿的时候，没有哪匹马会安安静静地站着。斯特雷克不想让人听见动静，于是他就把马牵到了高沼地里。”

“蜡烛，还有火柴，”我说，“当然是这样！”

“不错，”福尔摩斯说，“我从斯特雷克的口袋里还知道了更多情况。罗斯先生，你是个通晓世故的人。人们会把其他人的账单放在口袋里随身带着吗？不，他们不会。那么达比希雷先生是谁呢？那是约翰·斯特雷克的另一个名字。这个案子里还有一位女士。一位阔绰的女士。我向斯特雷克夫人试探了账单上列出的衣服和帽子，但她对这些东西一无所知。”

“那星期一晚上，在高沼地里，”罗斯先生说，“你认为发生了什么事？”

“这个怎么样？”福尔摩斯说，“斯特雷克把马带到山脚下。他看见辛普森的围巾在地上，就捡了起来——为什么，我也不知道。他把外套挂在一棵树上，取出蜡烛和火柴，还有那把刀，开始于他的活计。但‘银光’不喜欢这样。或许它受了惊，或许它觉得有什么不对劲。它是匹高大强壮的马，而且不耐烦了。它扬起后腿踢了出去，马蹄正中斯特雷克的脑袋。斯特雷克倒了下去，跌在泥地里，他手里的刀划到了自己的腿。那匹马消失在夜色中。”

“太精彩了！”罗斯先生说，“你讲得太生动了，福尔摩斯先生，我现在全明白了。”

“还有那些羊呢？”我问道，“那些羊是怎么回事？你对格雷戈里巡官说它们很重要。”

“啊，对了，华生，那些羊。”福尔摩斯笑了起来。“它们的确 很重要。在动物的肌腱上划一个小伤口不是那么容易，斯特雷克不想失手。他得先练习，但在哪儿练呢？他自己的羊，就在他面前。”

“我们回伦敦后第二天你去哪儿了？”我问道，“是去达比希雷先生账单上那个裁缝那儿吗？”

“太棒了，华生！”福尔摩斯大笑。“对，我拿了张斯特雷克的照片，那个裁缝一眼就认出他了。‘哦，是的，’她说，‘这是达比希雷先生。我替他做了很多衣服。达比希雷夫人是一位很美的女士，她喜欢昂贵的衣服。’”福尔摩斯又笑起来。“这是个老掉牙的故事。斯特雷克不是第一个享受齐人之福的男人。他需要更多的钱来满足那位奢侈的达比希雷夫人，于是他打起了‘银光’的主意。现在你知道是怎么回事了，罗斯先生。”

“对，我现在全明白了，”罗斯先生说，“福尔摩斯先生，太谢谢你了。不过还有件事。马当时在哪里？”

“啊，对。那匹马当时很安全，状况良好，跟一位朋友在一起。”福尔摩斯说，“我不能告诉你它跟谁在一起，或者在什么地方，因为我作出了承诺。不过，我们现在已经快到伦敦了。罗斯先生，你已经知道了谜底，又赢得了韦塞克斯杯，还是英格兰南部速度最快的赛马的主人。你还有什么不满足的呢？”

THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER

Tom Sawyer does not like school. He does not like work, and he never wants to get out of bed in the morning. But he likes swimming and fishing, and having adventures with his friends. And he has a lot of adventures.

But Tom's adventures can be dangerous, too. One night in the graveyard he and Huck Finn see three men. Who are they? And what are they doing in the graveyard, in the middle of the night? Then the boys see that one of the men is Injun Joe...

Tom and Huck never forget that night. They are afraid of Injun Joe — and they are right to be afraid because Injun Joe is very quick with a knife...

1

Tom and his friends

'Tom! Tom! Where are you?'

No answer.

'Where is that boy? When I find him, I'm going to...'

Aunt Polly looked under the bed. Then she opened the door and looked out into the garden.

'Tom!'

She heard something behind her. A small boy ran past, but Aunt Polly put out her hand and stopped him.

'Ah, there you are! And what's that in your pocket?'

'Nothing, Aunt Polly.'

'Nothing! It's an apple! I can see it. Now listen, Tom. Those apples are not for you, and I —'

'Oh, Aunt Polly! Quick — look behind you!'

So Aunt Polly looked, and Tom was out of the house in a second. She laughed quietly. 'I never learn. I love that Tom, my dead sister's child, but he isn't an easy boy for an old lady. Well, it's Saturday tomorrow and there's no school, but it isn't going to be a holiday for Tom. Oh no! He's going to work tomorrow!'

*　　*　　*

Saturday was a beautiful day. It was summer and the sun was hot and there were flowers in all the gardens. It was a day for everybody to be happy.

Tom came out of his house with a brush and a big pot of white paint in his hand. He looked at the fence; it was three metres high and thirty metres long. He put his brush in the paint and painted some of the fence. He did it again. Then he stopped and looked at the fence, put down his brush and sat down. There were hours of work in front of him and he was the unhappiest boy in the village.

After ten minutes Tom had an idea, a wonderful idea. He took up the brush again and began work. He saw his friend Joe Harper in the street, but he didn't look at him. Joe had an apple in his hand. He came up to Tom and looked at the fence.

'I am sorry , Tom.'

Tom said nothing. The paint brush moved up and down.

'Working for your aunt?' said Joe. 'I'm going down to the river. I'm sorry you can't come with me.'

Tom put down his brush. 'You call this work?' he said.

'Painting a fence?' said Joe. 'Of course it's work!'

'Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn't. But I like it,' said Tom. 'I can go to the river any day. I can't paint a fence very often.'

Joe watched Tom for about five minutes. Tom painted very slowly and carefully. He often stopped, moved back from the fence and looked at his work with a smile. Joe began to get very interested, and said:

'Tom, can I paint a little?'

Tom thought for a second. 'I'm sorry, Joe. You see, my aunt wants me to do it because I'm good at painting. My brother Sid wanted to paint, too, but she said no.'

'Oh, please, Tom, just a little. I'm good at painting, too. Hey, do you want some of my apple?'

'No, Joe, I can't —'

'OK, you can have all my apple!'

Tom gave Joe the brush. He did not smile, but for the first time that day he was a very happy boy. He sat down and ate Joe's apple.

More friends came to laugh at Tom, but soon they all wanted to paint, too. By the afternoon Tom had three balls, an old knife, a cat with one eye, an old blue bottle, and a lot of other exciting things. He was the richest boy in St Petersburg, and the fence — all thirty metres of it — was a beautiful white. He went back to the house.

'Aunt Polly! Can I go and play now?'

Aunt Polly came out of the house to look. When she saw the beautiful white fence, she was very pleased. She took Tom into the house and gave him an apple.

'Well, you can go and play. But don't come home late.'

Tom quickly took a second apple and ran off.

*　　*　　*

On Monday morning Tom didn't want to go to school, but Aunt Polly got him out of bed, and then out of the house. In the street near the school he met his friend Huckleberry Finn. Huck had no mother, and his father drank whiskey all the time, so Huck lived in the streets. He didn't go to school, he was always dirty, and he never had a new shirt. But he was happy. The mothers of St Petersburg didn't like Huck, but Tom and his friends did.

'Hello, Huck!' said Tom. 'What have you got there?'

'A dead cat.'

'What're you going to do with it?' asked Tom.

'I'm going to take it to the graveyard tonight,' Huck said. 'At midnight. A dead cat can call ghosts out of their graves.'

'I never heard that,' said Tom. 'Is it true?'

'Well, I don't know,' said Huck. 'Old Mrs Hopkins told me. Come with me, and see. Or are you afraid of ghosts?'

'Of course not!' said Tom. 'Come and meow for me at my window at eleven o'clock.'

After this, Tom was late for school, and the teacher looked at him angrily.

'Thomas Sawyer, why are you late again?' he said.

Tom began to speak, and then stopped. There was a new girl in the schoolroom — a beautiful girl with blue eyes and long yellow hair. Tom looked and looked.

Oh, how beautiful she was! And in two seconds Tom was in love! He must sit next to her. But how?

In the girls' half of the room there was only one empty chair, and it was next to the new girl. Tom thought quickly, and then looked at the teacher.

'I stopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn!' he said.

The teacher was very, very angry. Boys were often late for school. That was bad, but talking with Huckleberry Finn was worse, much worse! The teacher took his stick, and two minutes later Tom's trousers were very hot and the teacher's arm was very tired.

'Now, Tom Sawyer, you go and sit with the girls !'

Some of the children laughed. Tom walked to the chair next to the new girl, sat down and opened his book. The other children began to work again.

After ten minutes, the girl looked up. There was an apple on the table in front of her. She put it back on Tom's half of the table. A minute later the apple was in front of her again. Now it stayed. Next, Tom drew a picture of a house and put it in front of her.

'That's nice,' the girl said. 'Now draw a man.'

Tom drew a man next to the house. The man was taller than the house, and he had very big hands and very long legs. But the girl liked him.

'Can you draw me now?' she asked.

Tom drew a girl next to the man.

'You draw beautifully. I can't draw pictures.'

'I can teach you,' said Tom. 'After school.'

'Oh, please!'

'What's your name?' Tom asked.

'Becky. Becky Thatcher.'

Just then Tom felt a hand on his head. It was the teacher. He took Tom by the ear and moved him back to his chair in the boys' half of the room.

1 ．汤姆和他的伙伴们

“汤姆，汤姆 ，你在哪儿？”

没有人回答。

“这小鬼又跑哪儿去了，等我找到他，我要……”

波莉姨妈看了看床下，然后打开房门向花园望去。

“汤姆 ！”

她听到身后有动静。一个小男孩儿正要跑过，但是波莉姨妈伸出手把他拦住。

“哈，你在这儿！你的口袋里是什么？”

“什么都没有啊，波莉姨妈。”

“没有！那是个苹果！我看见了。现在听着，汤姆。这些苹果不是给你的，我要——”

“哎，波莉姨妈！快——看你后面！”

波莉姨妈看了一下，汤姆一转眼就跑出了屋子。她轻轻地笑了。“我又没长记性。我爱汤姆，我那死去的姐姐的孩子，但是我这个老太婆管不住他。明天是星期六，不用上学，但是汤姆不能放假。噢不！他明天可得要干活儿 ！”

*　　*　　*

星期六天气不错。夏天到了，艳阳高照，花园里繁花似锦。这是个人人都应该开心的好日子。

汤姆拿着一把刷子和一大桶白油漆从屋里走出来。他看着栅栏，栅栏足足有3米高、30米长。他把刷子蘸上油漆，开始刷栅栏，然后照旧这般。接着，他停了下来，看了看栅栏，放下刷子，坐了下来。他面前是好几个小时的工作呢，他是村庄里最不快乐的男孩儿了。

十分钟后，汤姆想出了一个主意，一个绝妙的主意。他重新把刷子拿起来，开始工作。他看到他的朋友乔·哈珀在街上，但是不去看他。乔手上拿着一个苹果。他走到汤姆面前，看着栅栏。

“我真 为你难过，汤姆。”

汤姆不说话，拿着刷子刷上刷下。

“帮你姨妈干活儿呢？”乔问道，“我要去河边。真可惜你不能和我一起去。”

汤姆放下刷子。“你管这叫干活儿？”他说。

“刷栅栏？”乔说，“当然是干活儿啦！”

“也许是，也许不是。但是我喜欢。”汤姆说，“我哪天去河边都成，但并不总是有机会刷栅栏啊。”

乔盯着汤姆看了差不多有五分钟。汤姆非常认真地慢慢刷着油漆。他时不时停下来，后退两步，看着自己的杰作微笑。乔开始感兴趣了，他问道：

“汤姆，我能刷一会儿吗？”

汤姆想了一下。“对不起，乔。你知道吗，我姨妈让我来干这活儿是因为我刷得好。我弟弟锡德也想刷呢，但她不同意。”

“哦，求求你，汤姆，就一点儿成吗？我也刷得挺好的。嗨，你想来点儿我的苹果吗？”

“不行，乔，我不能——”

“好吧，我把整个苹果都 给你！”

汤姆把刷子递给乔。他没有笑，但那是他那天第一次非常开心。他坐了下来，吃着乔的苹果。

更多的伙伴过来嘲笑汤姆，但不久他们就都想要刷油漆了。到下午时，汤姆已经有了三个球、一把旧的小刀、一只独眼猫、一个旧的蓝瓶子和其他许多稀奇玩意儿。现在他是圣彼得斯堡最富有的男孩儿了，而那道栅栏——整整30米长的栅栏——被涂上了美丽的白色。他走回屋子。

“波莉姨妈！现在我能出去玩了吗？”

波莉姨妈走出屋来检查，当她看到漂亮的白色栅栏时，非常满意。她把汤姆带回屋里，给了他一个苹果。

“好，你现在可以去玩了，但是别回来得太晚。”

汤姆飞快地又拿了一个苹果，跑出去了。

*　　*　　*

星期一的早上，汤姆不想去上学，但是波莉姨妈把他揪下床，丢出了门。在学校附近的街上，他遇到了好朋友哈克贝利·费恩。哈克没有母亲，父亲成天喝酒，所以哈克就露宿街头了。他不上学，总是脏兮兮的，从来没穿过新衣服，但是他很快乐。圣彼得斯堡的妈妈们不喜欢他，但是汤姆和伙伴们都喜欢他。

“你好啊，哈克！”汤姆说，“你那是弄了个什么？”

“一只死猫。”

“你要把它怎么样？”汤姆问。

“我打算今晚把它拿到坟场去。”哈克说，“在午夜的时候，一只死猫能把坟墓里的鬼魂召出来。”

“我从来没听说过。”汤姆说，“是真的吗？”

“哦，我不知道。”哈克说，“是老霍普金斯太太告诉我的。跟我来看看吧，你就能知道了。你不会害怕鬼吧？”

“当然不！”汤姆说，“11点钟到我窗口学猫叫叫我。”

这之后，汤姆上学迟到了，老师生气地看着他。

“托马斯·索亚，你怎么又迟到了？”他说。

汤姆开始讲话，然而又停住了。教室里有个新来的女生——一个有着蓝眼睛、黄色长发的漂亮女孩子。汤姆打量个不停。

哦，她长得多漂亮啊！短短两秒钟内，汤姆恋爱了！他必须 坐在她旁边。但怎么做呢？

在女生坐的那半边教室，只有一个空座位，就在那个新来女孩儿旁边。汤姆的脑筋转得飞快，然后他看着老师。

“我停下来和哈克贝利 ·费恩聊天了 ！”他说。

老师非常非常气愤。男孩子上学经常迟到，这当然不对，但是和哈克贝利·费恩讲话就更有错，大错特错！老师拿起了教鞭，两分钟后，汤姆的裤子都热辣辣的了，老师的胳膊也累得打不动了。

“现在，汤姆·索亚，你去和女生 坐在一起。”

有几个孩子笑了起来。汤姆走到新来的女生旁边的座位，坐下来，把书打开。其他的孩子也重新开始学习。

十分钟后，那女孩儿抬起头。她面前的桌上多了个苹果。她把苹果放回汤姆那边的桌上。很快，苹果又出现在她面前。这一次苹果没被推回去。接下来，汤姆画了一座房子，摆在她面前。

“画得真好。”女孩儿说，“再画个男人吧。”

汤姆在房子旁边画了个男人，人比房子还高，两手大大，双腿长长，但是那女孩儿喜欢。

“你能画个我吗？”她问。

汤姆在男人的旁边加上那女孩儿。

“你画得真漂亮，我就不会画画。”

“我教你吧。”汤姆说，“等放了学。”

“噢，好啊！”

“你叫什么名字？”汤姆问。

“贝姬，贝姬·撒切尔。”

就在这时，汤姆感觉到一只手落到他头上，是老师的手！他拧着汤姆的耳朵，把他拖回到了男生那半边他自己的座位上。

In the graveyard

That night Tom went to bed at half past nine. He waited for Huck's meow, and at eleven o'clock it came. He climbed quietly out of the bedroom window, and then he and Huck walked out of the village with the dead cat.

The graveyard was on a hill, about a mile from St Petersburg. When the boys got there, they put the dead cat on a grave, and sat down behind some trees. They watched, and waited. It was very dark, and very quiet.

'Do you see that new grave there?' whispered Huck. 'That's Hoss Williams' grave. He died last week.'

'Perhaps he can hear us,' Tom whispered back. 'Do you think he can, Huck?'

'I don't know, but I — '

'Sh!'

'Oh, Tom, what is it?'

'Sh!' whispered Tom. 'I can see something. Look!'

Huck moved nearer to Tom. 'Ghosts!' he said. 'Three of them! They're coming here, Tom! Oh, let's go home!'

'They can't see us,' Tom whispered. 'Not here.'

'Ghosts can see through trees,' said Huck unhappily. 'They can see through everything!'

The ghosts moved quietly through the graveyard and came nearer to the trees. Huck and Tom watched, very afraid. Then, after a minute, Huck said:

'Tom! They're not ghosts. That's Muff Potter.'

'So it is. And that's Injun Joe. And the other man is Doctor Robinson. What are they doing here?'

'They're graverobbers, Tom! They're going to rob a grave! My father told me about it. The doctor wants a dead body, you see. He cuts it up because he wants to learn about —'

'Sh!' said Tom. 'They're getting near.'

The three men stopped at Hoss Williams' grave and Injun Joe and Muff Potter began to dig. Ten minutes later the grave was open.

'Now, doctor,' said Muff Potter. 'You want us to take the body to your house? That's five dollars more.'

'No!' said the doctor. 'I gave you the money this morning. I'm not giving you any more!'

'Now you listen to me, doctor!' said Injun Joe. 'I want that money! Do you remember a day five years ago? I came to your house and asked for something to eat. And you gave me nothing. Nothing! So give me that money!'

He took the doctor's arm, but suddenly the doctor hit him, and Injun Joe fell to the ground.

'Don't hit my friend!' cried Muff Potter. He jumped on the doctor and the two men began to fight.

It all happened very quickly, and the two boys watched with open mouths. Injun Joe got up. He had Muff Potter's knife in his hand now, and he moved behind the doctor. Then the doctor hit Muff Potter on the head. Muff fell to the ground, and at the same moment the knife in Injun Joe's hand went into the doctor's back. The doctor fell to the ground, on top of Muff Potter, and he did not move again.

The two boys could watch no more. Very quietly, they moved away from the trees, and then ran out of the graveyard and back to the village.

Injun Joe stood by Hoss Williams' grave and looked down at the two men. Then he put the knife into Muff Potter's hand and sat down. Three — four — five minutes went by. Potter moved a little and opened his eyes.

'What — what happened, Joe?' he asked.

'This is bad, Muff,' said Joe. 'Why did you kill him?'

Muff looked at the doctor's dead body, then at the knife in his hand. 'Me? Did I kill him?' His face went white, and the knife fell from his hand. 'It's the whiskey, Joe! I never fight with knives usually. Oh, why did I drink all that whiskey tonight? I don't remember anything!'

'It's OK, Muff,' said Joe. 'I'm not going to tell anyone. You get away quickly. Go on — go now!'

Muff Potter got up and ran away. Joe watched him for a minute, then he carefully put the knife next to the doctor's body. Then he, too, left the graveyard.

*　　*　　*

The next day the Sheriff's men found the doctor's body in the graveyard — and Muff Potter's knife. That night Muff came to the graveyard to get his knife. But the Sheriff's men were there, and they took Muff to St Petersburg's little jail. And there Muff sat for four weeks, and waited for his trial.

*　　*　　*

Tom and Huck could not forget that night in the graveyard. They were very unhappy, and very afraid.

'What're we going to do?' said Tom. 'Muff Potter didn't kill the doctor — Injun Joe did. We saw him!'

'I know,' Huck said. 'But what can we do? We can't tell anyone. I'm afraid of Injun Joe. He's dangerous. And he's a killer. Do you want a knife in your back?'

'Yes, I'm afraid of him, too,' Tom said. He thought for a minute. 'I'm sorry for Muff Potter, but you're right, Huck. We can't tell anyone about Injun Joe.'

2 ．坟场命案

那天晚上，汤姆在9点半上了床，等着哈克来叫他。11点钟时，哈克来了。汤姆悄悄地从卧室窗户爬出去，然后和哈克带着死猫出了村庄。

坟场在一座小山上，离圣彼得斯堡大概一英里。两个男孩儿到达之后，把死猫放在一个坟头上，坐在树丛后面边看边等。四周黑漆漆的，非常安静。

“你看到那个新坟了吗？”哈克小声说，“那是霍斯·威廉斯的坟。他上星期死的。”

“也许他能听到我们。”汤姆也小声回应，“你觉得他能吗，哈克？”

“我不知道，但是我——”

“嘘 ！”

“哎呀，汤姆，那是什么？”

“嘘 ！”汤姆低声说，“我看见有东西。看！”

哈克朝汤姆挪近了些。“是鬼！”他说，“有三个呢！它们过来了，汤姆！呃，我们回家吧！”

“它们看不到我们。”汤姆低声说，“在这儿看不到。”

“鬼能够看穿树。”哈克不高兴地说，“它们能看穿一切！”

几个鬼静悄悄地穿过坟场，来到树丛附近。哈克和汤姆心惊胆战地看着他们，过了一会儿，哈克说：

“汤姆！那不是 鬼。那是穆夫·波特。”

“是他，还有印江·乔。另外那个人是鲁宾逊医生。他们在这儿干吗？”

“他们是盗墓贼，汤姆！他们是来盗墓的！我爸爸告诉过我。这个医生想要一具尸体，你明白了吧。他要把尸体剖开，因为他想知道——”

“嘘！”汤姆说，“他们走近了。”

三个人在霍斯·威廉斯的墓前停下，印江·乔和穆夫·波特开始挖掘。十分钟后，墓被挖开了。

“好了，医生，”穆夫·波特说道，“你想让我们帮你把尸体抬到家？再加五块钱吧。”

“不行！”医生说，“我早上给过你钱，不会再给了！”

“现在听我说，医生！”印江·乔说道，“我要那钱！你还记得五年前的一天吧？我到你家里讨口饭吃，你什么都没给我。什么都没给！还是给钱吧！”

他抓住医生的胳膊，但是医生猛地给了他一拳，他摔倒在地上。

“你敢打我的哥们儿！”穆夫·波特大叫。他扑向医生，两个人扭打起来。

一切发生得太快。两个男孩儿张大了嘴看着。印江·乔站了起来，来到医生的背后，他手上拿着穆夫·波特的刀。这时，医生一拳打中穆夫·波特的头。穆夫倒在地上。与此同时，印江·乔手上的刀插进了医生的后背。医生倒了下去，倒在穆夫·波特的身上，再也不动了。

两个男孩儿不敢再看下去了，他们小心翼翼地离开树丛，然后一口气跑出坟场，回到村庄。

印江·乔站在霍斯·威廉斯的墓旁，低头看着那两个家伙，然后他把刀放到穆夫·波特手里，坐下来。三分钟——四分钟——五分钟过去了，波特动了动，睁开了眼睛。

“怎么了——发生了什么，乔？”他问道。

“太糟糕啦，穆夫。”乔说，“你怎么把他给杀啦？”

穆夫看着医生的尸体，又看看手里的刀。“我？我杀了他？”他的脸变得惨白，刀从手上滑落下来。“都是威士忌害的，乔！一般我打架从来不用刀啊。唉，今天晚上我干吗喝那么多威士忌？我什么都不记得了！”

“别紧张，穆夫。”乔说，“我不会告诉任何人，你快跑吧。走——现在就走！”

穆夫·波特站起身来，逃走了。乔盯着他看了一阵，然后小心地把刀放在医生的尸体旁。随后，他也离开了坟场。

*　　*　　*

第二天，治安官的手下在坟场发现了医生的尸体——还有穆夫·波特的刀。当天晚上，穆夫回到坟场拿他的刀，但是警察已经等在那里了。他们把穆夫带回了圣彼得斯堡的小监狱。穆夫在那里关了四个星期，等待受审。

*　　*　　*

汤姆和哈克都忘不了坟场的那个夜晚。他们很郁闷，也很害怕。

“我们该怎么办？”汤姆说，“穆夫没杀医生——是印江·乔干的。我们看到 是他干的！”

“我知道。”哈克说，“可是我们能 做什么？我们谁都不能告诉。我害怕印江·乔。他太危险了，他是个杀人犯。你想自己的 背后也挨一刀吗？”

“对啊，我也害怕他。”汤姆说。他想了一会儿。“我为穆夫·波特难过，但是你说得对，哈克。我们不能告诉任何人印江·乔的事。”

On Jackson's Island

The summer holidays came, and there was no school. Tom didn't want to think about Muff Potter and Injun Joe, but it wasn't easy. At night, when he was in bed, he saw Injun Joe's face in the dark, and he couldn't sleep. But he couldn't talk to anyone about it.

One hot summer's day he and Joe Harper were down by the Mississippi River. They sat and watched the boats, and fished and talked.

'Let's get away from here!' said Tom, suddenly. 'Let's go and do something exciting somewhere.'

'OK,' said Joe. 'But what? And where?'

'I know,' Tom said. 'Let's run away. Let's go and live on Jackson's Island. We can sleep out, under the trees.'

Jackson's Island was in the Mississippi, three miles south of St Petersburg. Nobody lived there.

'Let's ask Huck Finn, too,' said Tom. 'But don't tell your mother or father or anyone. Go home and get some things to eat, and meet me here at midnight.'

So that night three boys in a small boat went down the river to Jackson's Island. They had some bread and some meat, and Huck had his pipe, too. When they got there, they carried everything on to the island and made a fire, under a big old tree. Then they cooked some of the meat over the fire, and oh, that meat was good — the best dinner in the world! Soon, they stopped talking, their eyes closed, and they slept.

The next morning Tom woke up with the sun on his head and a smile on his face. Then Huck and Joe woke up, and the three boys ran down to the river to swim. After that, they fished, and soon they had about six big fish for their breakfast. They cooked the fish on their fire and ate them all. They were very hungry.

'That,' said Joe happily, 'was a wonderful breakfast!'

After breakfast they walked through the island, swam some more, talked, fished, and swam again. They came back to their fire in the afternoon. Suddenly, Tom looked up and said, 'Listen. Can you hear boats?'

They listened, and then ran across the island to look down the river. There were twenty or more boats on the water. Every boat in St Petersburg was out.

'What are they doing?' asked Joe.

'They're Looking for a dead body, I think,' said Huck. 'They did that last summer when Bill Turner fell in the river and drowned.'

'Who's dead, do you think?' asked Joe.

The boys watched the boats. Suddenly, Tom cried, 'I know who's dead! It's us! They're looking for us!'

This was wonderful. Tom looked at his friends. 'We're famous!' he said. 'Everybody in St Petersburg is talking about us. And they all feel sorry for us!'

Night came, and the boys went to sleep. But Tom did not sleep, and when morning came, he wasn't there!

'Huck, where's Tom?' cried Joe.

'I don't know,' Huck began, 'but — Look! There he is. He's swimming across to the island now. Hey, Tom!'

At breakfast Tom told his story. 'I went home last night,' he said, 'and listened at the window. Joe, your mother was there, too, and she and Aunt Polly cried and cried. I heard some very interesting things. On Sunday there's going to be a big funeral at the church — for us! And listen— I've got a wonderful idea.'

Huck and Joe listened and laughed, and yes, it was a wonderful idea.

That night the boys cooked some more fish, and after dinner Huck got out his pipe and began to smoke.

'Can we smoke, too?' asked Tom. 'I want to learn.'

So Huck made pipes for Tom and Joe, and the three boys sat and smoked.

'Hey, I like smoking,' said Tom. 'It's easy!'

'It's nothing!' said Joe. 'I'm going to smoke every day.'

But after ten minutes Tom and Joe got quieter and quieter and their faces went an interesting colour.

'I'm going for a little walk now,' said Tom. He stood up, carefully, and walked away into the trees.

'Me too,' said Joe, quickly.

The two boys came back an hour later. But they didn't smoke their pipes again.

*　　*　　*

On Sunday morning there were no happy faces in St Petersburg. Aunt Polly and Joe's mother and father were in the church, and all the boys' friends. The minister said some very nice things about the three boys, and the boys' families cried and cried. Everybody cried. And little Becky Thatcher did not stop crying for one second.

There was a small noise at the back of the church, but at first nobody heard it. Then the minister looked up — and suddenly stopped speaking. Everybody turned to look. Their mouths opened, and stayed open.

And into the church came the three dead boys — Tom first, Joe next, and then Huck.

For a second nobody moved or spoke, and then the noise began. Aunt Polly and Joe's mother ran to the boys, and took them in their arms. Aunt Polly cried, and laughed, and cried again.

'Oh, Tom!' she said. 'You're a bad boy, but I love you!'

Suddenly, the minister called out, 'Oh, happy days! Sing, good people of St Petersburg! Sing and be happy!'

And everybody sang, and smiled, and laughed for a long time. It was St Petersburg's happiest funeral.

*　　*　　*

The weeks went by, and the judge came to St Petersburg. On the day before Muff Potter's trial, Huck and Tom met in the street near Tom's house. Huck was unhappy.

'Tom, you didn't tell anyone about — you know?'

'No, I didn't. But Huck, what about Muff? People are saying he's the killer. And he's going to die!'

'But we can't tell anyone about Injun Joe,' said Huck. 'I don't want to die, too! Do you?'

No, Tom didn't want to die. But he couldn't forget Muff Potter's face in the jail — old, tired, and unhappy. And Injun Joe was a free man. It wasn't right.

That night Tom came home late, and very excited. He could not sleep for two or three hours.

The next morning all the village was at Muff Potter's trial. Injun Joe was there, too. Muff waited, a tired old man with a dirty face. The judge began the trial.

Questions, questions, questions. Answers, answers, answers. And the answers were all bad for Muff Potter.

'Yes, I found the knife in the graveyard, next to Doctor Robinson's body.'

'Yes, that's Muff Potter's knife. He always carries it.'

'Yes, I saw Muff Potter in the village that afternoon. He had the knife with him then.'

Muff Potter began to look more and more unhappy. Then the judge said: 'Call Thomas Sawyer!'

St Petersburg sat up. What did young Tom Sawyer know? Everybody looked at him, and waited.

'Thomas Sawyer, where were you on the seventeenth of June, at the hour of midnight?'

'In the graveyard.'

'Why?'

'I went there to see ghosts. With a — a — dead cat.'

St Petersburg laughed, and the judge looked angry. 'And where were you in the graveyard, Thomas?'

'Behind the trees near Hoss Williams' grave.'

Injun Joe's face suddenly went white.

'Now, my boy,' said the judge. 'Tell us your story.'

And so Tom told his story, and St Petersburg sat and listened to him with open mouths.

'... and then Muff Potter fell, and Injun Joe jumped with the knife and —'

Crash! Injun Joe jumped through the window, and was out and away in a second.

*　　*　　*

St Petersburg loved Tom for a week. But Tom was not happy. Injun Joe was not in jail, and he was a dangerous man. Tom slept badly for weeks.

The slow summer days went by. Injun Joe did not come back to St Petersburg, and Tom began to forget.

3 ．杰克逊岛

暑假到了，不用上学啦。汤姆不愿去想穆夫·波特和印江·乔，但那并不容易。每到夜里，当他躺在床上，就会在黑暗中看到印江·乔的脸，以致无法入睡。但是他却不能告诉任何人。

一个炎热的夏日，他和乔·哈珀来到密西西比河边。两个孩子坐下来，看着往来的船只，一边钓鱼一边聊天。

“我们离开这儿吧！”汤姆突然说，“我们去别的地方找点儿乐子。”

“好啊，”乔说，“可是去干吗啊？去哪儿呢？”

“我心里有数。”汤姆说，“我们离开这儿，去杰克逊岛过日子。我们可以在露天、在大树底下睡觉。”

杰克逊岛在密西西比河上，离圣彼得斯堡南面三英里的地方，没有人在那儿居住。

“我们再问问哈克·费恩。”汤姆说，“但是别告诉你爸妈和其他人啊。回家拿点儿吃的，午夜的时候在这儿见。”

当天晚上，三个男孩儿划着一只小船，顺流来到杰克逊岛。他们带了些面包和肉，哈克还带着他的烟斗。到了那里，他们把所有东西都搬到岛上，然后在一棵古老的大树下生起了火。他们在火上烤了些肉，哎呀，肉真香啊——这真是世界上最好的晚餐！很快，他们就不再聊天了，闭上眼睛睡着了。

第二天早上，汤姆醒过来，阳光照在他的头上，微笑挂在他的脸上。哈克和乔也都醒了，三个男孩儿跑到河里去游泳，然后钓鱼，很快就钓到了六条大鱼来当早餐。他们在火上把鱼烤熟，然后吃得干干净净。他们都饿极了。

“这个，”乔兴高采烈地说，“真是顿丰盛的早餐啊！”

早餐之后，他们在岛上漫步，又游了一会儿泳，然后聊天，钓鱼，接着再游泳。下午的时候，他们回到了火堆边。突然，汤姆抬起了头，说道：“听！你们听见船的声音了吗？”

他们竖起了耳朵，然后跑着穿过小岛，向河上望去。水面上驶来了二十多只船，圣彼得斯堡所有的船都出动了。

“他们要干吗？”乔说。

“我想，他们是来找尸体的吧。”哈克说，“去年夏天，比尔·特纳掉进河里淹死的那次，他们也是这么干的。”

“你们说这回是谁死了？”乔问。

男孩子们看着船队。突然，汤姆叫了起来：“我知道谁死了！是我们，他们是来找我们的！”

这真是太棒啦。汤姆看看伙伴们。“咱们出名了！”他说，“圣彼得斯堡的每个人都在议论我们。他们都在为我们难过呢。”

夜晚来临，小伙伴们都睡觉了。但是汤姆没有睡，天亮的时候，他不见了！

“哈克，汤姆在哪儿？”乔叫道。

“我不知道。”哈克说，“但是——你看！他在那儿，正往岛上游呢。嗨，汤姆！”

吃早餐的时候，汤姆讲了自己的故事。“我昨晚回家了。”他说，“我在窗户外面偷听。乔，你妈妈也在那儿，她和波莉姨妈一直不停地哭。我听到些非常有趣的事。星期天在教堂会举行一个很大的葬礼——是为我们举行的！听着——我有个好主意。”

哈克和乔一边听一边笑，是啊，这真是个好主意。

那个晚上，小伙伴们又烤了些鱼。晚饭后哈克拿出了他的烟斗，开始抽起烟来。

“我们能抽一口吗？”汤姆问，“我想学学。”

于是哈克给汤姆和乔都做了个烟斗，三个男孩儿坐下来一起抽。

“嘿，我喜欢抽烟。”汤姆说，“这挺容易的！”

“这太容易了！”乔说，“我以后每天都要抽烟。”

可是十分钟后，汤姆和乔就越来越安静了，两个人的脸色非常有趣。

“我要去走一走。”汤姆说。他小心翼翼地站起来，走进了树林里。

“我也是。”乔很快也跟着说。

一个小时以后，两个男孩儿回来了，但是他们以后再也没有抽过烟斗。

*　　*　　*

星期天的早上，圣彼得斯堡每个人的脸上都写满了哀伤。波莉姨妈和乔的父母都在教堂里，还有三个孩子所有的小伙伴们。牧师先大大夸奖了三个孩子一番。他们的家人悲痛不已，每个人都在哭。小贝姬·撒切尔的抽泣一秒钟都没有停过。

教堂的后面有点儿动静，开始没有人听到。然后牧师抬起头来——突然停住不讲了。每个人都转回头去看，他们吃惊地张大嘴巴，合都合不上。

三个“死去的”男孩儿走了进来——汤姆走在最前面，乔在中间，最后是哈克。

有一会儿，没有人动或是讲话，然后大家骚动起来。波莉姨妈和乔的妈妈跑到孩子们身旁，把他们抱住。波莉姨妈先是哭，然后笑了起来，之后又哭了。

“噢，汤姆！”她说，“你这个坏小子，但是我爱你！”

突然，牧师叫了出来：“啊，真是个值得高兴的日子啊！圣彼得斯堡善良的人们，唱起来吧！快乐起来吧！”

每个人都唱了起来，微笑着，欢笑着，持续了很久。这是圣彼得斯堡最快乐的葬礼啦。

*　　*　　*

几周过去了，法官来到了圣彼得斯堡。在审判穆夫·波特前的一天．哈克和汤姆在汤姆家附近的街上见面。哈克心事重重。

“汤姆，你没告诉其他人吧——你知道我在说什么吧？”

“没有，我没有。但是哈克，穆夫怎么办？大家都说他是凶手。他会被判死刑的！”

“但是，我们不能告诉别人是印江·乔干的。”哈克说，“我也不想死啊！难道你想？”

不，汤姆不想死，但是他不会忘记穆夫·波特在监狱里的样子——苍老、憔悴又伤心。但是印江·乔却逍遥法外，这不公平。

那天晚上，汤姆回家很晚，但是非常亢奋，过了两三个小时还睡不着。

第二天早上，村里所有人都来听证审判穆夫·波特。印江·乔也在。穆夫等待着，这老人疲惫已极，脸上脏兮兮的。法官开始审问了。

先是询问、询问、询问，然后回答、回答、回答。所有的回答都对穆夫·波特不利。

“是的，我在坟场发现了这把刀，就在鲁宾逊医生的尸体旁。”

“是的，那是穆夫·波特的刀，他总是带着它。”

“是的，那天下午我在村里看到过穆夫·波特，当时他就带着那把刀。”

穆夫·波特的脸色越来越悲哀。这时法官说：“传唤托马斯·索亚！”

全村人都坐直了。小汤姆·索亚能知道什么呢？每个人都看着他，等待着。

“托马斯·索亚，6月17日的午夜12点钟，你在哪里？”

“在坟场。”

“为什么？”

“我去看鬼魂，带着一只——一只——死猫。”

全村人都笑了起来，法官看起来生气了。“你在坟场的什么地方，托马斯？”

“在树丛后面，霍斯·威廉斯的坟附近。”

印江·乔的脸刷的一下就变白了。

“好，孩子，”法官说，“告诉我们，你看到了什么。”

接着汤姆讲述了他看到的事，所有人都坐在那儿，张大了嘴巴听着。

“……然后穆夫·波特就倒下了，印江·乔跳起来，用刀——”

哗啦一声！印江·乔跳出了窗口，转眼之间就跑掉了。

*　　*　　*

整个星期，全村人都对汤姆赞不绝口，可汤姆并不高兴。印江·乔还没有被关起来，他是个危险分子。汤姆好几个星期都睡不好觉。

漫长的夏天渐渐过去。印江·乔没有回到圣彼得斯堡，汤姆也渐渐地淡忘了这件事。

Treasure

There is a time in every boy's life when he wants to go and dig for treasure. And that time came for Tom.

So, one hot summer's day, he went to find Huck.

Huck liked the idea of treasure. 'Where are we going to dig?' he asked.

'An old dead tree is best.'

'Who puts the treasure under old trees?'

'Robbers,' said Tom. 'And then they go away, or they forget to come back for the treasure.'

'There's a dead tree on Cardiff Hill,' said Huck. 'Let's go there! I've got an old pick and shovel.'

It was three miles to the old tree, and the boys arrived tired and hot. They dug for an hour or two, but they didn't find any treasure. Then they stopped, and Tom looked down at an old house at the foot of the hill.

'Hey, look!' he said. 'Nobody lives in that old house. Let's go there. Old houses are always good for treasure.'

'Good for ghosts, too!' said Huck.

They took the pick and shovel with them, went down the hill, and into the old house. They looked in all the rooms downstairs, and then went upstairs. But there was no treasure, and no ghosts. Then they heard a noise.

'Sh !' said Tom, suddenly. 'What's that?'

'Ghosts !' whispered Huck.

There were holes in the floor, and through them the boys could see into the rooms downstairs.

'No,' Tom whispered. 'It's two men. One is the old Spaniard. He came to live in the village last week. I don't know the other man. Sh! Let's listen to them.'

The two men sat down on the floor. The Spaniard had a green hat and long white hair; the other man was small and dark. He took out a bag and began to open it.

'It's hot in here,' the Spaniard said. He took off his green hat — and then he took off his long white hair!

'Tom !' Huck whispered upstairs. 'That's Injun Joe !'

'We took six hundred and fifty dollars when we robbed that house,' said the second man. He took some money out of the bag. 'We can take fifty dollars with us now. What are we going to do with the six hundred?'

'Leave it here,' said Injun Joe. 'We can come back and get it next week. Here, give me the bag.'

He walked across the room to the fireplace, moved two big stones from the floor, and began to dig with his knife.

Upstairs, the two boys watched excitedly. Treasure! Six hundred dollars of wonderful treasure!

Injun Joe stopped digging. 'Hello, what's this?' he said. 'There's something here. It's an old box.'

The two men got the box out and opened it.

'It's money!' said Injun Joe's friend.

Injun Joe put his hand into the box. 'There are thousands of dollars here!' he said, and the two men looked at the money with happy smiles.

'But who —' began Injun Joe's friend.

'Don't ask,' Injun Joe said. 'It's our money now.'

'We can't take it with us today,' said his friend. 'What can we do with it? Put it back under the floor?'

'Yes,' said Injun Joe. (Happy faces upstairs.) 'No! (Very unhappy faces upstairs.) Let's put it under the cross — nobody goes there. We can take it there tonight.'

When night came, the two men carried all the money away. The boys did not go after them because they were afraid of Injun Joe. But they wanted very much to find that 'cross'.

*　　*　　*

For a week the two boys thought and thought about the treasure. It was 'under the cross', but where was the cross? In St Petersburg the boys watched the 'Spaniard' carefully, but they didn't see a cross, and they didn't find the treasure.

4 ．宝藏

每个男孩子的生命中都有过这么一个时期：想去挖掘宝藏。现在汤姆也到这个时期啦。

于是，在一个炎热的夏日，汤姆去找哈克。

哈克喜欢这个寻宝的主意。“可我们去哪儿挖呢？”他问。

“最好找一棵枯死的老树。”

“谁会把宝藏埋在老树下？”

“强盗呗，”汤姆说，“他们埋下宝藏就走了，或者忘记回来取宝藏。”

“加的夫山上有一棵枯死的树。”哈克说，“我们去那儿吧！我有一把旧镐和铁锹。”

去那棵老树有三英里远，走到的时候，两个孩子又累又热。他们挖了一两个小时，可是什么宝藏也没发现，两人停了下来。汤姆看到山脚下有一栋老房子。

“嘿，看！”他说，“没人住那个老房子。我们去那儿吧。老房子里一般都有宝藏。”

“还有鬼呐！”哈克说。

他们带着镐和铁锹下了山，来到那栋老房子里，先看了楼下所有的房间，然后又上楼继续找。但是这儿既没有宝藏，也没有鬼魂。接着，他们听到有动静。

“嘘 ！”汤姆突然说，“那是什么？”

“是鬼 ！”哈克小声回答。

地板上有洞，两个男孩儿能够从洞里看到楼下。

“不是，”汤姆悄声说，“是两个人，一个是老西班牙人。他是上周来到村子里住的。另外那个我不认识。嘘！听听他们在讲什么。”

那两个人坐在地板上。西班牙人戴着一顶绿帽子，留着长长的白头发；另外那人是个小个子，长得挺黑。他拿出一个袋子，然后打开。

“这里面真热。”西班牙人说道。他把绿帽子摘下来——接着把白色的长发也拿掉了！

“汤姆 ！”哈克在楼上小声说，“他是印江 ·乔 ！”

“我们抢劫那屋子的时候，拿到了650块钱。”另一个人说，他从口袋里拿出一些钱。“我们能随身带上50块，那600块怎么办？”

“就放在这儿。”印江·乔说，“我们可以下星期回来拿，把袋子给我。”

他穿过房间，走到壁炉旁边，从地板上挪开两块大石头，然后用他的刀挖掘起来。

楼上的两个男孩儿兴奋地看着。宝藏！1600块钱的财富啊！

印江·乔停住不挖了。“嘿，这是什么？”他说，“这儿有东西，是个旧箱子。”

两个家伙把箱子搬出来，打开。

“是钱！”印江·乔的同伙说。

印江·乔把手伸进箱子里。“这里有好几千块钱呢！”他说。两个人看着钱，脸上都露出了得意的笑容。

“但又是谁——”他的同伙开口问。

“别问啦。”印江·乔说，“现在钱是我们的了。”

“今天我们不可能把钱带走。”他的同伙说道，“我们把它放哪儿呢？还放在地板下面？”

“对。”印江·乔说，（楼上喜不自胜。）“不！（楼上失望之极。）我们把它放在十字架下面，没人去那儿。我们今天晚上就把钱带走。”

夜晚来临，两个人把所有的钱都拿走了。两个孩子没有跟踪他们，因为害怕印江·乔，但是他们非常想找到“十字架”。

*　　*　　*

一个星期了，两个孩子脑子里只想着宝藏，它在“十字架下面”，但是十字架在哪儿呢？在圣彼得斯堡，两个孩子小心翼翼地监视着“西班牙人”，但是他们没有看到十字架，也没有发现宝藏。

In the cave

The next Saturday was Becky Thatcher's birthday, and all Becky's friends were very excited.

'It's going to be a wonderful day,' Becky told Tom. 'We're going to have a picnic by the river, and after that, we can visit McDougal's Cave.'

So in the morning, a big boat took Becky, Tom, and all their friends down the river. There were some older children on the boat too, but all the mothers and fathers stayed at home. Picnics are better without them!

And it was a very happy, noisy picnic.

After the picnic, the children took out their candles, and ran up the hill to the cave. The mouth of the cave was dark, and some of the children were afraid at first. But caves are exciting, so in the end everybody went in.

McDougal's Cave was very, very big, with hundreds of tunnels and rooms. The tunnels went up, down, and into the hill for miles. You could walk for days in McDougal's Cave. Nobody knew all the cave, but many people knew the tunnels near the door. You could play all day in these tunnels. Tom, of course, knew them well.

For hours the children walked and ran through the cave, up and down the tunnels, in and out of the rooms. In the evening they came out, and walked down the hill to the boat, tired but happy.

When the boat arrived back in St Petersburg, it was dark. Huck Finn saw the boat, but he did not know about the picnic. He did not go to birthday picnics, of course, because the mothers of St Petersburg did not like him. But tonight Huck was only interested in treasure — Injun Joe's treasure. Injun Joe was in an old building by the river, and Huck waited in the street near the building.

'Perhaps,' he thought, 'Injun Joe's cross is in there. And the box of money. I must wait and watch. I can tell Tom about it tomorrow.'

But Injun Joe didn't come out. At midnight it began to rain, and Huck waited all night in the cold street. In the morning he could not move and he could not speak. He felt cold, then hot, then cold, then hot again. Mrs Douglas, a woman from the church, found him in the street. She took him to her home and put him to bed. And there he stayed for two weeks. He was very ill, and so he did not hear about Tom and Becky.

But on Sunday morning all St Petersburg knew about Tom and Becky — because they were not on the boat when it came back to the village. Where were they? Were they lost in the cave? And were they alive, or dead?

*　　*　　*

At first Tom and Becky played with their friends in the cave. Then Tom wanted to go down a new tunnel, and Becky went with him.

They walked and talked, and went into a second tunnel, then a third. Sometimes Tom put a mark with candle smoke on the tunnel wall — he wanted to find the mouth of the cave again! Then they came out of the tunnels into a big room. There were hundreds of bats in this room, and the candles woke them up. Tom took Becky's hand and they ran into the nearest tunnel, with the bats behind them. But one bat hit Becky's candle and it went out. The children ran and ran through the tunnels, and at last they got away from the bats. They stopped and sat down. Suddenly, it was very, very quiet.

'Where are we now, Tom?' Becky whispered, afraid.

'I don't know,' said Tom. 'I think it's time to go back. But we can't go through that big room because of the bats. Let's go down this tunnel.'

They went down one tunnel, then a second, a third, a fourth... Then they wanted to find the big room with the bats again, but they couldn't. Becky began to cry:

'Tom, we can't get out. We're lost, Tom, we're lost!'

They walked, and walked. When they were tired, they sat down. Then they got up and walked again. Time went by. Was it day, or night? They didn't know.

Then Tom wanted to find water. They had nothing to eat, and they must have something to drink. They found a very small river and sat down next to it.

'Becky,' said Tom. 'We must stay here. Near this river. This is our last candle, and...'

He did not finish, but Becky understood.

'Tom?'

'Yes, Becky.'

'Are they going to come and look for us?'

'Of course! When the boat gets to St Petersburg —'

'But how can they find us, in these hundreds of tunnels? Oh, Tom, Tom, we're going to die in here!'

Becky began to cry again. Then the candle went out and the two children were in the dark. They sat for hours and hours. They slept a little, then woke up, then slept again. Was it Sunday now? Or Monday?

Suddenly Tom sat up. 'Listen! Somebody's calling!'

The two children listened. They heard it again, a little nearer. They called back; then they began to walk down the tunnel in the dark, with their hands on the wall. They stopped and listened again, but now they couldn't hear anything. Slowly, they went back to their river.

They slept again, and woke up very, very hungry.

'Perhaps it's Tuesday now,' Tom thought. 'What can I do? I must do something !' Then he had an idea.

'Becky, listen. I've got a long string in my pocket. I can go down some of the small tunnels and get back to you with the string. You wait here.'

Slowly and carefully, Tom went down the first tunnel on his hands and knees. Then the tunnel wall on his right finished, and there was nothing. Tom put out his hand to feel the floor. And just then, away to his right, he saw a hand — a hand with a candle.

At once Tom called out. 'Help!' he cried.

The hand moved, and Tom saw an arm and a face. It was Injun Joe! Tom was very afraid, but Injun Joe was afraid too, and he quickly ran away down the tunnel.

Tom went back to Becky, but he did not tell her about Injun Joe. Tom waited for an hour, then went into a different tunnel with his string. Then a third tunnel...

*　　*　　*

It was Tuesday evening, and St Petersburg waited. Many of the villagers were in the cave, and they looked for the children day and night. But they heard nothing, saw nothing, and found nothing.

Then, late that evening, there was a sudden noise in the streets. People began to run to the Thatchers' house.

'They're here! Becky and Tom are here!'

Most of the village came to listen to Tom's story.

'It was in the sixth tunnel,' he told them. 'I went to the end of my string, and suddenly, I could see daylight! There was a little hole in the cave wall. I put my head out, and there was the river, right under my nose! I went back and got Becky, and we climbed out through the hole. Then we stopped a boat on the river. We were five miles from the mouth of the cave!'

*　　*　　*

Tom was very tired after his three days in the cave, and he went to bed and stayed there for two days. He heard about Huck and went to see him on Sunday, and then every day. But Mrs Douglas was always in the room.

'You can just say hello,' she told Tom. 'And then you must go. Huck is very ill, and he needs to sleep.'

So Tom could not talk about anything exciting, and he could not tell Huck about Injun Joe.

One day, about two weeks after the picnic, Tom was in Becky's house, and her father came in.

'Well, Tom,' Mr Thatcher said. 'Would you like to go back to the cave again, one day?'

'I'm not afraid of that cave,' said Tom.

Mr Thatcher laughed. 'There are a lot of people like you, Tom. But nobody's going into the cave again. There are big doors across the cave mouth now — and nobody can open them!'

Tom's face went white. 'But Mr Thatcher — Injun Joe's in that cave!'

An hour later, fifty men were at the cave and they opened the doors. Injun Joe was on the ground, dead, his face to the door and his knife in his hand.

5 ．洞中历险

下个星期六是贝姬·撒切尔的生日，贝姬所有的朋友都很兴奋。

“这一天会很棒的。”贝姬告诉汤姆，“咱们要到河边野餐，然后到麦克杜格尔山洞去玩。”

于是一大早，贝姬、汤姆，还有所有的伙伴们，乘着一条大船顺流而下，一些大孩子也上了船，但是所有的父母亲都在家里。没有他们，野餐才更自在！

而这真是个快活、热闹的聚会。

野餐结束后，孩子们取出蜡烛，跑向山上的洞。洞口很黑，一开始，有些孩子觉得害怕，但是山洞探险非常刺激，所以最后每个人都进了山洞。

麦克杜格尔山洞非常非常大，有几百条隧道和几百个洞穴。隧道迂回曲折，通到山里深达几英里的地方。在麦克杜格尔山洞里可以走上好几天呢。没有人熟悉整个山洞，但是很多人知道靠近洞口的那些隧道。在这些隧道里可以玩上整整一天。当然啦，汤姆是非常熟悉这些隧道的。

孩子们在洞里走啊，跑啊，在隧道和洞穴里穿来穿去，玩了几个小时。傍晚的时候，他们出来了，走下山来到船上，他们都很疲惫，但是玩得很尽兴。

当船终于回到圣彼得斯堡的时候，天都已经黑了。哈克·费恩看到了船，但他并不知道野餐的事。他没有参加生日聚餐，因为圣彼得斯堡的妈妈们都不喜欢他。可是今晚，哈克唯一感兴趣的就是宝藏——印江·乔的宝藏。印江·乔住在河边的一栋老房子里，哈克就在房子旁边的街上守候着。

“也许，”他想，“印江·乔的十字架就在这儿，还有那箱钱。我一定要盯住了，明天就可以告诉汤姆。”

但是印江·乔没有出来。午夜的时候，天开始下雨了，哈克在寒冷的街道上等了一整夜。早上的时候，他既动不了，也说不出话了，觉得身上一阵冷一阵热。从教堂来的道格拉斯太太在街上发现了他，把他带回了家，让他睡在床上。哈克在那儿待了两个星期。他病得很严重，所以他不知道汤姆和贝姬出了事。

但是到星期天早上，全村人都知道汤姆和贝姬出事了——因为船回到村里时，他们俩不在船上。他们在哪儿？是在山洞里迷路了吗？他们是活着，还是死了？

*　　*　　*

一开始，汤姆、贝姬和伙伴们都一块儿在山洞里玩，后来汤姆想去一条没走过的隧道，贝姬跟他一起去了。

他们边走边聊，接着又拐进了一条隧道，然后又进了另一条隧道。有时，汤姆用蜡烛烟在隧道石壁上做个记号——他想重新找到洞口！然后他们走出隧道，来到一个很大的洞穴。这里面有几百只蝙蝠，蜡烛把它们都唤醒了。汤姆抓起贝姬的手跑到最近的隧道，蝙蝠在后面追赶着他们。但是有一只蝙蝠擦过贝姬的蜡烛，把蜡烛弄灭了。两个孩子沿着隧道一直跑啊跑啊，最后终于摆脱了蝙蝠。他们停住坐了下来。突然，四周变得非常非常安静。

“我们在哪儿，汤姆？”贝姬小声问道，她害怕了。

“我不知道。”汤姆说，“我想我们应该回去了。但是我们过不了那个洞穴，因为有蝙蝠，我们走这条隧道吧。”

他们走进了一条隧道，然后是第二条、第三条、第四条……后来他们想要去找那个有蝙蝠的大洞穴了，但是却找不到。贝姬哭起来了：

“汤姆，我们出不去了。我们迷路了，汤姆，我们迷路了！”

他们走啊，走啊，累了就坐下休息，然后又起来继续走。时间渐渐过去，现在是白天还是晚上呢？他们不知道。

汤姆想要找到水源。他们没有东西吃，但是必须喝点儿什么呀。他们找到了一处很小的水流，就在旁边坐下。

“贝姬，”汤姆说，“我们只能留在这里，待在水源旁边。这是最后一根蜡烛了，而且……”

他没有说完，但是贝姬明白。

“汤姆？”

“嗯，贝姬。”

“他们会回来找我们吗？”

“当然！等船一到圣彼得斯堡——”

“但是他们怎么才能找到我们呢？这里有几百条 隧道呢。哦，汤姆，汤姆，我们会死在这里的。”

贝姬又哭了起来。接着蜡烛就灭了，两个孩子坐在黑暗里。他们坐了好久好久，一会儿睡过去，一会儿醒过来，一会又睡过去。现在是星期天了吗？还是星期一呢？

突然，汤姆坐了起来。“听！有人在叫呢！”

两个孩子听着。他们又听到了那叫声，这次要近一些。他们也大叫回应，然后在黑暗中，开始用手扶着石壁顺着隧道走。他们停下又听了听，但这时却什么都听不到了。两人又慢慢地走回水边。

他们又睡着了，醒过来的时候，觉得非常非常饿。

“今天也许是星期二了。”汤姆想，“我应该怎么做呢？我一定得做点儿什么 ！”然后他想出了一个主意。

“贝姬，听着。我口袋里有一根很长的细绳。我可以去其他隧道看看，然后再顺着细绳回来找你。你在这里等我。”

汤姆手脚并用，小心翼翼地慢慢爬进第一条隧道。然后在他右边的石壁到了头，再没有去路了。汤姆伸出手在地上摸索。就在这时，他看到右边有一只手——手上还拿了一支蜡烛。

汤姆马上叫了起来。“救命啊！”他大喊。

那只手动了动，然后汤姆看到一条手臂和一张脸。那是印江·乔！汤姆魂飞天外，但是印江·乔也吓得不轻，他飞快地沿着隧道跑开了。

汤姆回到贝姬的身边，但是没有告诉她印江·乔的事。他等了一个小时，然后牵着细绳进了另外一条隧道，接着是第三条……

*　　*　　*

已经是星期二的傍晚了，圣彼得斯堡还在等待消息。很多村民都来到山洞里，夜以继日地寻找两个孩子。但是他们什么也听不到，什么也看不见，什么都没找到。

然而，那天深夜，街上突然骚动起来。人们开始往撒切尔家跑去。

“他们在这儿！贝姬和汤姆在这儿！”

村里大部分的人都来了，听汤姆讲他们的经历。

“那是第六条隧道，”他告诉他们，“我牵着绳子，走到了头，突然，我看到有光！洞壁上有一个小洞。我把头伸出去，看到了河水，就在我的鼻子底下！我回去找到贝姬，我们一起从洞里爬了出来。然后拦下河上的船。我们离洞口有五英里远呢！”

*　　*　　*

在山洞里待了三天，汤姆非常疲倦，他在床上躺了足足两天。他听说了哈克的消息，于是在星期天去看他，那以后汤姆每天都去找哈克。但是道格拉斯太太总在房里。

“你只能和哈克打个招呼。”她告诉汤姆，“然后你就得走了。哈克病得很重，他需要休息。”

所以汤姆没法和哈克聊天，告诉他那些刺激的事，也没法跟哈克讲印江·乔的事情。

有一天，大概是野餐过后的两个星期吧，汤姆正在贝姬的家里，她的父亲走了进来。

“哎呀，汤姆，”撒切尔先生说道，“你以后还想回到那个山洞去吗？”

“我可不害怕那个山洞。”汤姆说。

撒切尔先生笑了。“很多人都跟你一样，汤姆。但是没有人可以再进那个山洞了。现在洞口被大门封住了——没有人能够打开！”

汤姆的脸一下子变白了。“但是撒切尔先生——印江·乔还在洞里面呢！”

一个小时后，有50个人来到了山洞，他们把门打开。印江·乔就倒在地上，他死了，他的脸朝着大门，手里握着刀。

Under the cross

The day after Injun Joe's funeral, Huck was out of bed. He and Tom walked slowly out of the village. They had a good, long talk, and Huck heard all about the picnic, the cave, and Injun Joe.

'We're never going to find the money now,' said Huck.

'Huck,' said Tom. 'The money isn't in St Petersburg. It's in the cave — I know it is! Why was Injun Joe in the cave? Because he took the box of money there! Right?'

Huck looked excited. 'Say that again, Tom!'

'The money's in the cave! And we can get to it easily. Let's go there now! I've got some candles and a long string. We can take a boat and put it back later.'

Twenty minutes later the boys were in a boat on the Mississippi. They went eight miles down the river, and then Tom stopped by some small trees.

'Here we are!' he said.

Tom's hole was just behind the trees. Tom took a candle and climbed in. Huck climbed in after him.

'Injun Joe never found this hole,' said Tom. 'Or he did find it and couldn't get through it. It's very small.'

The boys went carefully through the tunnels with their string. Then Tom stopped.

'I saw Injun Joe about here,' he said. 'And look, Huck — there's the cross!'

There was a big smoke cross on the tunnel wall. The boys looked up and down the tunnel, but there was no box of money.

'Injun Joe said under the cross,' said Tom. 'Perhaps it's under the ground. Look, we can move these stones.'

The boys took their knives and began to dig by the tunnel wall. Very soon, they found a second, smaller tunnel under the wall. They climbed down into it, and came into a small room. There was a bed, two whiskey bottles, some old shoes — and the box of money.

*　　*　　*

When somebody finds treasure, everybody hears about it very quickly. The two boys carried the box through the village. And when they got to Aunt Polly's house, half the village was with them. Everybody went into the house.

'Oh, Tom, Tom!' cried Aunt Polly. 'What is it now? And what have you got there?'

Tom put the box on the table and opened it.

There were twelve thousand dollars in that box. And suddenly, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn were the richest people in St Petersburg.

rich adj. having a lot of money or property 富有的

6 ．十字架下

埋葬印江·乔的第二天，哈克可以下床活动了。他和汤姆慢慢地走出村庄。他们畅谈了一番，哈克听汤姆讲了关于野餐、山洞和印江·乔的所有的事。

“我们再也找不到那些钱了。”哈克说。

“哈克，”汤姆说，“钱不在圣彼得斯堡。钱在山洞里——我知道它在！要不然印江·乔在山洞里干吗？因为他把那箱钱放在那儿了！对吧？”

哈克非常兴奋。“说得对，汤姆！”

“钱在山洞里！我们很容易就能找到。我们现在就去吧！我有一些蜡烛和一根长绳。我们划条船去，过后再把船放回来。”

20分钟后，两个孩子已经泛舟密西西比河上了。他们顺着河流行驶了八英里，然后汤姆在几棵小树前停了下来。

“我们到了！”他说。

汤姆找到的那个洞就在这些树的后面。汤姆拿了一根蜡烛，爬了进去。哈克也跟在他后面爬了进去。

“印江·乔没找到这个洞，”汤姆说，“或者他找到了，却钻不过去。这个洞非常小。”

两个男孩儿牵着绳子，小心地在隧道里走。然后，汤姆停下了。

“我是在这儿附近看到印江·乔的，”他说，“看，哈克——十字架在这里！”

在石壁上有一个大大的、用烟熏成的十字架。他们上上下下地打量着隧道，却没有看到那一箱钱。

“印江·乔说是在十字架下面 。”汤姆说，“也许是埋在地下呢。看，我们能搬开这些石头。”

两个男孩儿拿出小刀，开始在石壁下面挖起来。很快，他们在墙下面发现了另一条更小的隧道。两人爬了进去，进入到一个小小的石室。里面有一张床，两个空威士忌酒瓶和几只旧鞋子——还有那箱钱。

*　　*　　*

当有人找到宝藏，其他人很快就会听说。两个孩子把箱子抬进了村子。当他们来到波莉姨妈家的时候，村子里一半的人都跟着他们俩。每个人都挤进了屋子。

“哦，汤姆，汤姆！”波莉姨妈叫道，“又怎么了？那个箱子里有什么？”

汤姆把箱子放在桌子上，把它打开。

箱子里有12,000块钱。突然间，汤姆·索亚和哈克贝利·费恩成了圣彼得斯堡最富有的人。
