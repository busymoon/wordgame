    "He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented.--*Paris*",
    "His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science.--*Paris*",
    "The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady.--*Paris*",
    "It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief.--*Paris*",
    "The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion.--*Paris*",

    "He kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care.--*Paris*",
    "He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.--*Paris*",
    "Little Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse.--*Paris*",
    "\nFrom that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously.--*Paris*",
    "The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies.--*Paris*",
    "Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession.--*Paris*",
    "Then it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so hated and so menaced.--*Paris*",
    "When he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, Quasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an \"almost--*Paris*",
    "Now, in 1482, Quasimodo had grown up.--*Paris*",
    "One might almost say that he had assumed its form, as the snail takes on the form of its shell.--*Paris*",
    "It was his dwelling, his hole, his envelope.--*Paris*",
    "The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell--*Paris*",
    "It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled.--*Paris*",
    "He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving.--*Paris*",
    "To see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have said that he had tamed them.--*Paris*",
    "\nMoreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral, but his mind also.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame.--*Paris*",
    "But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling.--*Paris*",
    "The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.--*Paris*",
    "The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb.--*Paris*",
    "He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving blindly within him.--*Paris*",
    "The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind.--*Paris*",
    "The reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily, divergent and perverted--*Paris*",
    "The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things.--*Paris*",
    "He received hardly any immediate perception of them.--*Paris*",
    "The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us.--*Paris*",
    "The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious.--*Paris*",
    "He was malicious, in fact, because he was savage; he was savage because he was ugly.--*Paris*",
    "There was logic in his nature, as there is in ours.--*Paris*",
    "This justice must, however be rendered to him.--*Paris*",
    "Malevolence was not, perhaps, innate in him.--*Paris*",
    "Human words were, for him, always a raillery or a malediction.--*Paris*",
    "As he grew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him.--*Paris*",
    "He had caught the general malevolence.--*Paris*",
    "He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded--*Paris*",
    "The other statues, those of the monsters and demons, cherished no hatred for him, Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men.--*Paris*",
    "The saints were his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded him.--*Paris*",
    "So he held long communion with them.--*Paris*",
    "If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade.--*Paris*",
    "And the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and all nature beside.--*Paris*",
    "He loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear.--*Paris*",
    "On this score, the big bell was his beloved.--*Paris*",
    "So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio; but big Marie was his favorite--*Paris*",
    "\nNo idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said, \"Go!\"--*Paris*",
    "he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it.--*Paris*",
    "He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer.--*Paris*",
    "They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion.--*Paris*",
    "\"Vah!\"he cried, with a senseless burst of laughter.--*Paris*",
    "Then Quasimodo boiled and frothed; he went and came; he trembled from head to foot with the tower.--*Paris*",
    "He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe.--*Paris*",
    "He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure.--*Paris*",
    "One feels that something has disappeared from it.--*Paris*",
    "It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo had taught him to talk, to read, to write.--*Paris*",
    "Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.--*Paris*",
    "He was in sympathy with but two things in this world: Notre- Dame and Claude Frollo--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, and above all, it was gratitude.--*Paris*",
    "Gratitude so pushed to its extremest limit, that we do not know to what to compare it.--*Paris*",
    "This virtue is not one of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men.--*Paris*",
    "One had grown up, the other had grown old.--*Paris*",
    "\n* An official of Notre-Dame, lower than a beneficed clergyman, higher than simple paid chanters.--*Paris*",

    "In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best lard turns rancid.--*Paris*",
    "The big brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil.--*Paris*",
    "He sometimes preached Jehan very long and severe sermons, which the latter intrepidly endured.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the young scapegrace had a good heart, as can be seen in all comedies.--*Paris*",

    "Whether this was sincere horror, or the game played by the thief who shouts, \"stop thief!\"--*Paris*",
    "\nAnd if, as he grew older, abysses had formed in his science, they had also formed in his heart.--*Paris*",
    "Why was what hair he had left already gray?--*Paris*",
    "\nHowever, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary.--*Paris*",
    "The mere rustling of a silken petticoat caused his hood to fall over his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "And he had refused to appear before the princess--*Paris*",
    "there's a fellow whose soul is made like the other one's body!\"--*Paris*",
    "But the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the bellringer.--*Paris*",

    "He had just retired, after the office, to his canon's cell in the cloister of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of his revery there came a knock at his door.--*Paris*",

    "\"\n\"I do not understand you,\" said Gervaise.--*Paris*",

    "Well, Mahiette, what did they do with it in Paris?--*Paris*",
    "I am quite sure that no charitable person wanted it.\"--*Paris*",
    "While chatting thus, the three worthy ~bourgeoises~ had arrived at the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",

    "Show me the Rat-Hole, that I may carry her her cake--*Paris*",
    "\"\n\"Immediately,\" said Oudarde, \"'tis a charity.\"--*Paris*",
    "I will give you warning when you can approach.\"--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, she laid her finger on her lips, and made a sign to Mahiette to draw near and look--*Paris*",
    "Her chin rested on her knees, which her crossed arms pressed forcibly to her breast.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she had turned to stone with the cell, ice with the season.--*Paris*",
    "Her hands were clasped, her eyes fixed.--*Paris*",
    "At first sight one took her for a spectre; at the second, for a statue--*Paris*",
    "The three women, for Gervaise had rejoined Mahiette and Oudarde, gazed through the window.--*Paris*",
    "\"Do not let us trouble her,\" said Oudarde, in a low voice, \"she is in her ecstasy; she is praying.\"--*Paris*",
    "When she withdrew her head from the window, her countenance was inundated with tears.--*Paris*",
    "But neither their looks nor their tears disturbed the recluse.--*Paris*",
    "\nThe three women had not yet uttered a single word; they dared not speak, even in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "They remained silent, they meditated, they were ready to kneel.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to them that they were ready to enter a church on the day of Tenebrae.--*Paris*",

    "\"Then we must leave the cake on the window,\" said Oudarde; \"some scamp will take it.--*Paris*",

    "\"Good day, madam,\" said the child, gravely.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, this shock had, so to speak, awakened the recluse.--*Paris*",
    "said Oudarde, with great compassion, \"would you like a little fire?\"--*Paris*",

    "He was known to be deaf; one might have pronounced him to be blind.--*Paris*",
    "They placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no resistance.--*Paris*",
    "They removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he allowed them to have their way.--*Paris*",
    "It was Master Pierrat Torterue, official torturer to the Chatelet.--*Paris*",
    "With his left hand, he negligently folded back his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit--*Paris*",
    "And the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.--*Paris*",
    "At length the torturer stamped his foot.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start.--*Paris*",
    "\nA second blow followed the first, then a third, and another and another, and still others.--*Paris*",
    "The wheel did not cease to turn, nor the blows to rain down.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability.--*Paris*",
    "He had at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement, to break his bonds.--*Paris*",
    "The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the provost's seasoned bonds resisted.--*Paris*",
    "Amazement gave way, on his features, to a sentiment of profound and bitter discouragement.--*Paris*",
    "He closed his single eye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death.--*Paris*",
    "From that moment forth, he stirred no more.--*Paris*",
    "\nThe populace, especially in the Middle Ages, is in society what the child is in the family.--*Paris*",
    "We have already shown that Quasimodo was generally hated, for more than one good reason, it is true.--*Paris*",
    "Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves particularly prominent.--*Paris*",
    "All cherished some rancor against him, some for his malice, others for his ugliness.--*Paris*",

    "\nAt first he held his ground.--*Paris*",
    "He first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "All this only increased the derision and hooting.--*Paris*",
    "There was neither shame nor redness on his face.--*Paris*",
    "He was too far from the state of society, and too near the state of nature to know what shame was.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, with such a degree of deformity, is infamy a thing that can be felt?--*Paris*",
    "As far away as he could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew gentler.--*Paris*",
    "In proportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more distinct, more radiant.--*Paris*",
    "It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the unhappy man was greeting.--*Paris*",
    "The cloud descended more blackly than ever upon Quasimodo's brow.--*Paris*",
    "The smile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged, profoundly sad--*Paris*",
    "Not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim, except to jeer at his thirst.--*Paris*",
    "cried Robin Poussepain, throwing in his face a sponge which had been soaked in the gutter.--*Paris*",
    "\"There, you deaf villain, I'm your debtor.\"--*Paris*",
    "chimed in a man, flinging a broken jug at his breast.--*Paris*",
    "\"And my cat bring forth a kitten with six paws!\"--*Paris*",
    "yelped an old crone, launching a brick at him.--*Paris*",
    "\"Drink!\"repeated Quasimodo panting, and for the third time.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment he beheld the crowd give way.--*Paris*",
    "A young girl, fantastically dressed, emerged from the throng.--*Paris*",
    "She was accompanied by a little white goat with gilded horns, and carried a tambourine in her hand--*Paris*",
    "He doubted not that she had come to wreak her vengeance also, and to deal her blow like the rest.--*Paris*",
    "He beheld her, in fact, mount the ladder rapidly.--*Paris*",
    "It was the first, in all probability, that the unfortunate man had ever shed--*Paris*",
    "\nMeanwhile, be had forgotten to drink.--*Paris*",
    "Then the poor deaf man fixed on her a look full of reproach and inexpressible sadness.--*Paris*",
    "On the pillory, the spectacle was sublime--*Paris*",
    "\nThe very populace were captivated by it, and began to clap their hands, crying,--\n\"Noel!--*Paris*",

    "thou shalt ascend it once more!\"--*Paris*",
    "\"The sacked nun is in one of her tantrums,\" muttered the populace; and that was the end of it.--*Paris*",
    "For that sort of woman was feared; which rendered them sacred.--*Paris*",
    "People did not then willingly attack one who prayed day and night.--*Paris*",
    "He was unbound, the crowd dispersed--*Paris*",
    "\"What, sir, did you eat the whole of it?\"--*Paris*",
    "she went on.\"Mother, it was the dog.--*Paris*",
    "I told him, but he would not listen to me.--*Paris*",
    "Then I bit into it, also.\"--*Paris*",
    "said the mother, smiling and scolding at one and the same time.--*Paris*",
    "He already eats all the fruit from the cherry-tree in our orchard of Charlerange.--*Paris*",
    "So his grandfather says that be will be a captain.--*Paris*",
    "Just let me catch you at it again, Master Eustache.--*Paris*",
    "\"\n\"Yes, truly,\" replied the young man, and fell back into his glacial and absent-minded silence.--*Paris*",
    "Can one be more white and blonde?--*Paris*",
    "and that neck--does it not assume all the curves of the swan in ravishing fashion?--*Paris*",
    "and how happy you are to be a man, naughty libertine that you are!--*Paris*",
    "Is not my Fleur-de-Lys adorably beautiful, and are you not desperately in love with her?\"--*Paris*",
    "\"Of course,\" he replied, still thinking of something else.--*Paris*",
    "We can assure our readers that timidity was neither the captain's virtue nor his defect.--*Paris*",
    "But he made an effort to do what was demanded of him.--*Paris*",
    "\"Fair cousin,\" responded Fleur-de-Lys, in an offended tone, \"I have already told you three times.--*Paris*",
    "He felt the necessity of making some conversation.--*Paris*",
    "\"For the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs,\" answered Fleur-de-Lys, without raising her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "The captain took up a corner of the tapestry.--*Paris*",
    "There was a rather pettish intonation in Fleur-de-Lys's-- laconic words.--*Paris*",
    "In truth, people no longer sit thus on their banners, I assure you--*Paris*",
    "she said, in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "\"Is not that the hotel in which is enclosed the garden of the Ling\u00e8re du Louvre?\"--*Paris*",
    "there are indeed many superb high warp tapestries there.\"--*Paris*",
    "Charles VI.!\"muttered the young captain, twirling his moustache.--*Paris*",
    "\"Good heavens!what old things the good dame does remember!\"--*Paris*",
    "Madame de Gondelaurier continued, \"Fine tapestries, in truth.--*Paris*",
    "A work so esteemed that it passes as unrivalled.\"--*Paris*",
    "The sonorous vibration of a tambourine was, in fact, audible.--*Paris*",
    "\"Some gypsy from Bohemia,\" said Fleur-de-Lys, turning carelessly toward the square.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he was of a fickle disposition, and, must we say it, rather vulgar in taste.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader reconcile these things as best he can.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the poor young girl was pouting against the dictates of her heart.--*Paris*",
    "\"I believe so, fair cousin,.\"--*Paris*",
    "Come and see if you recognize her, fair Cousin Phoebus.\"--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus looked, and said,--\n\"Yes, I recognize her by her goat.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"Oh!in fact, what a pretty little goat!\"--*Paris*",
    "said Amelotte, clasping her hands in admiration.--*Paris*",
    "\"Madame my mother,\" said Fleur-de-Lys gently, \"that gate is now called the Porte d'Enfer.\"--*Paris*",
    "Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier knew how her mother's antiquated mode of speech shocked the captain.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, he began to sneer, and muttered between his teeth: \"Porte Gibard!--*Paris*",
    "Porte Gibard!'Tis enough to make King Charles VI.--*Paris*",
    "All the young girls raised their eyes.--*Paris*",
    "His costume could be plainly discerned, and his face resting on both his hands.--*Paris*",
    "But he stirred no more than if he had been a statue.--*Paris*",
    "His eyes, intently fixed, gazed into the Place--*Paris*",
    "\"'Tis monsieur the archdeacon of Josas,\" said Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "\"You have good eyes if you can recognize him from here,\" said the Gaillefontaine.--*Paris*",
    "\"How he is staring at the little dancer!\"--*Paris*",
    "said Fleur-de-Lys, \"for he loves not Egypt.\"--*Paris*",
    "exclaimed all the young girls, clapping their hands.--*Paris*",
    "\"Why!'tis not worth while,\" replied Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "\"She has forgotten me, no doubt, and I know not so much as her name.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, as you wish it, young ladies, I will make the trial.\"--*Paris*",
    "And leaning over the balustrade of the balcony, he began to shout, \"Little one!\"--*Paris*",
    "The dancer was not beating her tambourine at the moment.--*Paris*",
    "repeated the captain; and he beckoned her to approach.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold.--*Paris*",
    "Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls.--*Paris*",
    "She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark.--*Paris*",
    "The noble damsels were dazzled by her in spite of themselves.--*Paris*",
    "Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty.--*Paris*",
    "But they understood each other perfectly.--*Paris*",
    "Women's instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men.--*Paris*",
    "An enemy had just arrived; all felt it--all rallied together.--*Paris*",
    "\nHence the welcome accorded to the gypsy was marvellously glacial.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was the first to break the silence.--*Paris*",
    "\"Upon my word,\" said he, in his tone of intrepid fatuity, \"here is a charming creature!--*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys replied to the captain with a bland affectation of disdain;--\"Not bad.\"--*Paris*",
    "repeated, with comical dignity, little B\u00e9rang\u00e8re, who would have reached about as high as her hips--*Paris*",
    "She interrupted him, with a smile and a look full of infinite sweetness,--\n\"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "\"She has a good memory,\" remarked Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "\"Come, now,\" resumed Phoebus, \"you escaped nimbly the other evening.--*Paris*",
    "There was in the intonation of that \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "yes,\" an ineffable something which wounded Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "I have been told that by birth he is the bastard of an archdeacon and a devil.--*Paris*",
    "The name of some festival when the bells are pealed!--*Paris*",
    "So he took the liberty of carrying you off, as though you were made for beadles!--*Paris*",
    "\"I do not know,\" she replied.--*Paris*",
    "A bellringer carrying off a wench, like a vicomte!--*Paris*",
    "a lout poaching on the game of gentlemen!--*Paris*",
    "that is a rare piece of assurance.--*Paris*",
    "However, he paid dearly for it.--*Paris*",
    "said the gypsy, in whom these words revived the memory of the pillory.--*Paris*",
    "\"Corne-de-boeuf!here's pity as well placed as a feather in a pig's tail!--*Paris*",
    "May I have as big a belly as a pope, if--\"\nHe stopped short.--*Paris*",
    "\"Pardon me, ladies; I believe that I was on the point of saying something foolish.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"He talks to that creature in her own tongue!\"--*Paris*",
    "added Fleur-de-Lys, in a low tone, her irritation increasing every moment--*Paris*",
    "\"Rather savagely dressed,\" said Diane de Christeuil, laughing to show her fine teeth.--*Paris*",
    "This remark was a flash of light to the others.--*Paris*",
    "Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume.--*Paris*",
    "\"That petticoat is so short that it makes one tremble,\" added la Gaillefontaine.--*Paris*",
    "There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation.--*Paris*",
    "Sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks.--*Paris*",
    "There was also happiness and tenderness in that gaze.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she endured for fear of being expelled.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus laughed, and took the gypsy's part with a mixture of impertinence and pity.--*Paris*",
    "he repeated, jingling his golden spurs.--*Paris*",
    "exclaimed the blonde Gaillefontaine, drawing up her swan-like throat, with a bitter smile--*Paris*",
    "She was very beautiful at that moment.--*Paris*",
    "The old dame, who was watching this scene, felt offended, without understanding why.--*Paris*",
    "she suddenly exclaimed, \"what is it moving about my legs?--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy disentangled his horns without uttering a word--*Paris*",
    "\n\"Oh!here's the little goat with golden hoofs!\"--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the fondling head of the goat.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she was asking pardon for having quitted it thus.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Diane had bent down to Colombe's ear.--*Paris*",
    "why did not I think of that sooner?--*Paris*",
    "They say she is a sorceress, and that her goat executes very miraculous tricks.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"Well!\"said Colombe, \"the goat must now amuse us in its turn, and perform a miracle for us.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"Little one, make your goat perform a miracle.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"I do not know what you mean,\" replied the dancer.--*Paris*",
    "\"A miracle, a piece of magic, a bit of sorcery, in short.\"--*Paris*",
    "And she fell to caressing the pretty animal, repeating, \"Djali!--*Paris*",
    "\nThe gypsy raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,-- \"That is my secret.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"I should really like to know what your secret is,\" thought Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply.--*Paris*",
    "But the nearer she approached it, the more her pace slackened.--*Paris*",
    "An irresistible magnet seemed to hold her.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly she turned her eyes, wet with tears, towards Phoebus, and halted.--*Paris*",
    "exclaimed the captain, \"that's not the way to depart.--*Paris*",
    "By the way, my sweet love, what is your name?\"--*Paris*",
    "\"La Esmeralda,\" said the dancer, never taking her eyes from him.--*Paris*",
    "At this strange name, a burst of wild laughter broke from the young girls.--*Paris*",
    "\"Here's a terrible name for a young lady,\" said Diane.--*Paris*",
    "\"You see well enough,\" retorted Amelotte, \"that she is an enchantress.\"--*Paris*",
    "In an instant they had become good friends.--*Paris*",
    " The letters arranged upon the floor formed this word,--\nPHOEBUS.--*Paris*",
    "\"Was it the goat who wrote that?\"--*Paris*",
    "she inquired in a changed voice.--*Paris*",
    "It was impossible to doubt it; the child did not know how to write.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy beheld the piece of folly which the goat had committed.--*Paris*",
    "\"Phoebus!\"whispered the young girls, stupefied: \"'tis the captain's name!\"--*Paris*",
    "she stammered mournfully, hiding her face in both her beautiful hands, \"she is a magician!\"--*Paris*",
    "The cell, as we have already said, had only one window opening upon the rear of the church.--*Paris*",
    "There he stood, grave, motionless, absorbed in one look and one thought.--*Paris*",
    "It was a fixed gaze, which was, nevertheless, full of trouble and tumult.--*Paris*",
    "This man seemed to be the gypsy's companion.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo could not distinguish his features from his elevated post--*Paris*",
    "All at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran through his whole body: \"Who is that man?\"--*Paris*",
    "he muttered between his teeth: \"I have always seen her alone before!\"--*Paris*",
    "Then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase, and once more descended.--*Paris*",
    "His savage eye had a singular expression; it was a charmed, tender look.--*Paris*",
    "murmured Claude.\"Is it the gypsy at whom he is thus gazing?\"--*Paris*",
    "he said, mingling with the group of spectators which the sound of the tambourine had collected.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing mocking or ironical in the priest's glance, it was serious, tranquil, piercing.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon was the first to break the silence.--*Paris*",
    "You are to explain many things to me.--*Paris*",
    "Motley red and yellow, like a Caudebec apple?\"--*Paris*",
    "\"Messire,\" said Gringoire, piteously, \"it is, in fact, an amazing accoutrement.--*Paris*",
    "You see me no more comfortable in it than a cat coiffed with a calabash.--*Paris*",
    "Behold me then, in the garments of a stage-player, like Saint Genest.--*Paris*",
    "\"\n\"'Tis a fine profession that you are engaged in!\"--*Paris*",
    "So, when you addressed me, I was as foolish as an ass before a turnspit.--*Paris*",
    "One must eat every day, and the finest Alexandrine verses are not worth a bit of Brie cheese.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, I was on the point of dying with hunger.--*Paris*",
    "But, reverend master, it is not sufficient to pass one's life, one must earn the means for life--*Paris*",
    "\"Very good, Master Pierre; but how comes it that you are now in company with that gypsy dancer?\"--*Paris*",
    "said Gringoire, \"'tis because she is my wife and I am her husband.\"--*Paris*",
    "The priest's gloomy eyes flashed into flame.--*Paris*",
    "\"Then why do you talk of husband and wife?\"--*Paris*",
    "demanded the archdeacon, who had been gradually appeased by this recital.--*Paris*",
    "\"'Tis very difficult to explain,\" replied the poet.--*Paris*",
    "Hence it follows that both of us remain very virtuous.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"What would you have a man do, Dom Claude, as against a superstition?--*Paris*",
    " 'Tis a proud wasp, I can tell you!\"--*Paris*",
    "She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led.--*Paris*",
    "And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently.--*Paris*",
    "It meant a shelter and bread at least.--*Paris*",
    "A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.--*Paris*",
    "He loved her goat almost as dearly.--*Paris*",
    "It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat.--*Paris*",
    "But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply.--*Paris*",
    "\"Perhaps it is a word which she believes to be endowed with some magic and secret virtue.--*Paris*",
    "She often repeats it in a low tone when she thinks that she is alone.\"--*Paris*",
    "said the priest.\"This is what I imagine, messire.--*Paris*",
    "These Bohemians are something like Guebrs, and adore the sun.--*Paris*",
    "\"That does not seem so clear to me as to you, Master Pierre.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"After all, that does not concern me.--*Paris*",
    "Let her mumble her Phoebus at her pleasure.--*Paris*",
    "One thing is certain, that Djali loves me almost as much as he does her.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect for a moment.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he turned abruptly to Gringoire once more--*Paris*",
    "\n\"And do you swear to me that you have not touched her?\"--*Paris*",
    "\"My wife?I swear to you that I have not.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"A good hour every evening.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"I will also swear it by the head of my father, for the two things have more affinity between them.--*Paris*",
    "But, my reverend master, permit me a question in my turn.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon's pale face became as crimson as the cheek of a young girl.--*Paris*",
    "You are not yet damned, so far as I know.--*Paris*",
    "I take an interest in you, and wish you well.--*Paris*",
    "Now the least contact with that Egyptian of the demon would make you the vassal of Satan.--*Paris*",
    "You know that 'tis always the body which ruins the soul.--*Paris*",
    "\"\n\"I tried once,\" said Gringoire, scratching his ear; \"it was the first day: but I got stung.\"--*Paris*",
    "\"You were so audacious, Master Pierre?\"--*Paris*",
    "and the priest's brow clouded over again.--*Paris*",
    "The old church, all vibrating and sonorous, was in a perpetual joy of bells.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry--*Paris*",
    " Quasimodo was always there, nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him?--*Paris*",
    "That day the air was so pure and light that Quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells.--*Paris*",
    "No laziness, Thibauld; thou art relaxing; go on, go on, then, art thou rusted, thou sluggard?--*Paris*",

    "At last he dashed his cap roughly on the floor, and exclaimed: \"So much the worse!--*Paris*",

    "He descended the Rue de la Harpe toward the City.--*Paris*",
    "* Truly, these roastings are a stupendous thing!--*Paris*",

    "\"I am going to see,\" he said to himself on the way.--*Paris*",
    "it must needs be a curious thing, that cell which my reverend brother hides so secretly!--*Paris*",
    "\"Ugh!\"said the scholar; \"'tis here, no doubt.\"--*Paris*",
    "He is visible only to his waist.--*Paris*",
    "It is horrible and it is beautiful--*Paris*",
    "It also was a gloomy and sparsely lighted retreat.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, the cell was not deserted.--*Paris*",
    "A man was seated in the arm-chair, and bending over the table.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan observed, with a sigh, that there was no frying-pan.--*Paris*",

    "These are no dreams; it is the general law of nature.--*Paris*",
    "But what is one to do in order to extract from science the secret of this general law?--*Paris*",
    "What!this light which inundates my hand is gold!--*Paris*",

    "\"You put a great deal of heat into that oath;\" said Tristan, with his inquisitorial glance.--*Paris*",
    "The poor woman felt her assurance vanishing more and more.--*Paris*",
    "\nHere another soldier came up, crying,--\n\"Monsieur, the old hag lies.--*Paris*",
    "The sorceress did not flee through the Rue de Mouton.--*Paris*",
    "The street chain has remained stretched all night, and the chain guard has seen no one pass.\"--*Paris*",
    "I believe, in fact, that she crossed the water.\"--*Paris*",

    "There was blood on the man's head and face, and he was very, very dead.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He had shoes on, but no socks, and we saw a night-shirt under his open coat.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "I went and got the workman, and Holmes wrote a note for Dr Huxtable.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "The poor workman took one look at the body, and began to run quickly down the hill to Ragged Shaw.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Now,' said Holmes, 'before we go on, let's think carefully for a minute.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He was dressed, he did not leave suddenly, he wanted to go\u2014perhaps with someone, perhaps not.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "But the German teacher left without his socks and without his shirt, so he left very suddenly.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Because, from his bedroom window, he saw the boy.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Because he wanted to follow him and bring him back.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "The Inspector here is working hard, but we need help.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "We must find poor Straker's killer, and I want to find my horse.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "asked Holmes.'Let's talk on the way,' the Inspector said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'I'd like you to see everything in the daylight.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "We were soon out of the little town and up on the brown hills of the moor.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Inspector Gregory thought that the killer was Fitzroy Simpson.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Simpson was out in the rain that night.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "His suit was still wet on the Tuesday,' he said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'He had a big stick, and his scarf was in the dead man's hand.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "That looks bad, Mr Holmes, very bad.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Holmes smiled.'You need more than that, Inspector.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Yes, he said it had money in it \u2014 a ten-pound note for the stable boy--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'\n'What about this other training stables, at Capleton?'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "'This is a strange knife,' Holmes said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He looked at it carefully, and then gave it to me.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'It's an eye knife,' I said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "You don't usually see them outside a hospital--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "'One is a letter from Mr Ross, the others are bills,' the Inspector said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He was a friend of Straker's, his wife tells us.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "His letters sometimes came here, and Straker sent them on.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Mrs William Darbyshire is an expensive lady,' said Holmes, looking at the bill.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Twenty-five pounds is a lot of money, for just one dress and one hat.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "\n'No, Mrs Straker, but here is Mr Holmes, the famous detective from London.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'I think I met you a month or two ago, Mrs Straker,' said Holmes.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Let me see...Yes, it was in Plymouth, at a garden-party.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'But I remember so well... You had a blue dress, and a dark blue hat with white flowers on it.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "It was on the tree, carefully away from the mud on the ground.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Now, I must look at the mud down there.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "For some minutes Holmes looked carefully at the ground, his eyes only centimetres away from the mud.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "From out of the mud he took a match, or a small piece of one.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "said the Inspector.'I knew it was there, you see,' said Holmes.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Holmes smiled but did not answer.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He then took the shoes, got down on the ground, and began to look at all the tracks in the mud.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "We stood and watched him, but after five minutes Mr Ross looked at his watch.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Er, this is very interesting, Mr Holmes,' he said, 'but is it going to take a long time?'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'I don't need to do any more here.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Watson and I are going to take a little walk across the moor now, with the horseshoe.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "Here he is, out on the cold wet moor.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'He looks for a nice warm stable,' I said, 'with food and water.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "We walked quickly down the hill, and at the bottom we found a small river and some very wet ground.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "He had a red, angry face.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Go away!We don't want visitors here!--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "He looked back at me and said quietly, 'Wait for me here, Watson.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Twenty minutes later they came out again.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Holmes looked pleased, and Mr Silas Brown was a different man.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "Oh yes, you can be sure of it.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Holmes and I then began to walk back to King's Pyland along the road.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "He doesn't want them to know about this, and I can help him with that--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'\n'But why didn't the police find the horse?'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "I asked.'Inspector Gregory said they went to Capleton.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Oh, it's easy to change the colour of a horse's coat.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Holmes laughed again.'Gregory is a good policeman, But I don't think he knows much about horses.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "After that, it was easy, and he told me everything.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "He found Silver Blaze on the moor early in the morning and brought him into the stables.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "The horse is very well, just a different colour at the moment.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Brown put a very big bet on Desborough to win the Wessex Cup, you see.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "And with Silver Blaze out of the race...'\n'But why did you leave the horse there?--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "I did not understand Holmes's plan.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'My dear Watson,' Holmes said, 'the horse is very safe.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Silas Brown is afraid of me, afraid of the police, afraid of losing everything.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "Back at King's Pyland, we found Mr Ross and Inspector Gregory in the trainer's house.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'But my friend and I must go back to London by the midnight train.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "The Inspector and Mr Ross stared at him, and I saw that Holmes was right about Mr Ross.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'So our famous London detective can't find poor Straker's killer,' Mr Ross said.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'It's a difficult case, that's true,' said Holmes quietly.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'But your horse is going to run in the Wessex Cup next Tuesday.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'Hm!A promise is a wonderful thing,' said Mr Ross.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "'But I would like the horse better than a promise.'--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "You can taste it in most food, but not in curry.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",
    "Curry has a very strong taste, stronger than opium.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "Nobody can see the cut, and the horse only feels it a little.--*book_bug_1_nodrm*",

    "There was only one answer.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I took out the nail from the window on the left, but the window still would not open.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So I was sure there was a hidden spring somewhere, and after a while I found it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I pressed it, arid then I could open the window--*book_bug_2*",
    "\n'I put the nail back into its hole, and thought some more.--*book_bug_2*",

    "The nail in this window looked the same, but ...--*book_bug_2*",
    "There must be something wrong with this nail, I said to myself.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I touched it\u2014and the head of the nail came off in my fingers.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The rest of the nail stayed in the wood.--*book_bug_2*",

    "She was a nice, sweet little thing, and people soon said they were engaged to be married.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When he got to the hill just outside the town, he saw Unity Sallet by the side of the road.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He knew Unity very well.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Once, he nearly asked her to marry him \u2014 but then he got together with Milly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When Tony came up to her in the wagon, Unity said, 'My dear Tony, can I ride home with you?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "So Unity smiled, jumped up into the wagon and Tony drove on up the hill.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Tony,' she said, in a soft little voice, 'why did you leave me for that other girl?--*book_bug_2*",
    "I'll be a fine wife, and a loving one, too.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And you've known me for a long time, haven't you, Tony?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'\n'And \u2014 can you say I'm not pretty, Tony?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "He looked at her for a long while.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'I really can't,' said he.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'No, I think you're the prettiest girl in the world.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'So I'm prettier than she is, am I?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Luckily, before Tony could answer, he saw a girl's hat over the hedge round a turning in the road.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He knew the hat very well \u2014 it was Milly's hat.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I'll be in terrible trouble if she sees you with me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Now, dearest Unity, we don't want any fighting or anything, do we?--*book_bug_2*",
    "So will you lie down in the back of the wagon, under the tarpaulin?--*book_bug_2*",
    "And I'll think about what you said, and perhaps I'll put a loving question to you, and not Milly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Nothing is decided yet between her and me, you know.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "So Unity lay down under the tarpaulin in the back of the wagon, and Tony drove on to meet Milly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Milly said crossly, when he came near.--*book_bug_2*",
    "said Milly.'You asked me to meet you, to ride home with you--*book_bug_2*",
    "I remember now.Oh dear \u2014 I mean, jump in then, Milly dear!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "So Milly climbed into the wagon and Tony drove on.--*book_bug_2*",
    "They talked about this and that, and looked at the trees and the birds.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then they came to a house by the road, and looking out of an upstairs window was Hannah Jolliver.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Now Hannah was a tall, good-looking girl, with long red hair.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And Tony was in love with her for a long time \u2014 before Milly, and before Unity.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I'm afraid she's going to be angry, because she's found out that I'm going to marry you.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Then will you hide under the empty sacks just here in the front of the wagon, behind the seat?--*book_bug_2*",
    "She hasn't seen us yet, and then there won't be any angry words.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Well, all right, if it helps you, Tony,' said Milly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She didn't really want to, but she got down behind the seat and hid under the sacks.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So there was Milly hiding in the front of the wagon, and Unity hiding in the back--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Aren't you going to ask me to ride home with you?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "said Tony, who didn't know what to say.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Can't you see I've got my hat and coat on?--*book_bug_2*",
    "So he stopped the wagon, while Hannah ran downstairs and got in beside him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Tony drove on again, and then Hannah looked at him out of the corner of her eye.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'And I like riding with you,' he said after a while.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then he looked into her eyes again \u2014 a good, long, slow look.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He began to like her more and more.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And then he couldn't remember why he ever wanted to marry Milly or Unity.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He moved nearer to Hannah on the seat, and they talked in soft little whispers.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And after a time Tony said, 'Ah, my sweet Hannah!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Tony gave a quick look behind him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'I haven't asked her the question yet,' he whispered, 'and I'm not sure I will.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There's an animal in the back of the wagon!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'It's just empty sacks, and it's the wheels that make that little screaming sound.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "But he knew that he was in trouble, and he didn't know what to do next.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then the wagon came round a corner in the road and Tony saw his father in a field.--*book_bug_2*",
    "His father held up his hand, and Tony saw his escape.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Well, if you're going to marry Milly Richards, do it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But don't go driving around the country with Jolliver's daughter.--*book_bug_2*",
    "People will talk.You mustn't do it, boy.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "All three of them are in that wagon, and I don't know what to do!--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Which one of them did not ask to ride with you?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Tony looked round, and saw his wagon moving.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He began to run across the field as fast as he could.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Milly, under the sacks, was the one who screamed.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She began to move about, and then saw another woman's foot.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So she moved along under the tarpaulin until she found Unity.--*book_bug_2*",
    "she asked angrily.'I can ask you the same question,' said Unity--*book_bug_2*",
    "\n'I'm engaged to be married to him, and I can \u2014'\n'Oh no, you're not,' said Unity.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He said it just now \u2014 we heard him.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "When Hannah heard voices under the tarpaulin, she forgot the horse and turned round.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The horse decided to go home, and moved off much too quickly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The horse looked round and stood still.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Nobody was hurt, but when Tony ran up, the three girls were all shouting and crying and screaming.--*book_bug_2*",
    "said Tony.They did not stop crying and screaming, so he spoke more loudly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'I must do what's right,' he said.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'I've asked Hannah to marry me, and she's agreed \u2014'\n'Oh no, I haven't!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'You must think I'm soft in the head!--*book_bug_2*",
    "I'm not marrying a man who keeps girls in the back of his wagon!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Perhaps she did still want him, but she didn't want to say so in front of the other girls--*book_bug_2*",
    "Milly was crying her eyes out, and Tony's father thought that she was the best wife for him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But you never do what your father tells you to, do you?--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Well, will you marry me, Unity dear?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "So then it was just Milly and Tony.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Milly was still crying, and Tony stood there and looked at her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Well, here we are,' he said at last.--*book_bug_2*",
    "said Tony.And then he kissed her, put the wagon back on the road, and they drove home.--*book_bug_2*",

    "In the centre of the stone floor is the pit.--*book_bug_2*",

    "What new terror will they send me now?--*book_bug_2*",
    "I look around my metal prison.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Already, something is different, something has changed.--*book_bug_2*",
    "What is it?And this yellow light, where is it coming from?--*book_bug_2*",
    "I look again at the metal walls \u2013 and now I can see the narrow gap along the bottom.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I get down to look, but cannot see through the gap.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I stand up again, I see at once what is different.--*book_bug_2*",

    "Oh, any terror, but not this!--*book_bug_2*",
    "I run from the edge and hide my face in my hands.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It is getting hotter, much hotter.--*book_bug_2*",

    "The walls will push me until I fall into the pit!--*book_bug_2*",
    "There will be no escape from this death.--*book_bug_2*",
    " I give one last, long scream\u2014\nVoices!--*book_bug_2*",

    "Now the burning walls are moving back.--*book_bug_2*",
    "A hand catches my arm as I begin to fall, fainting, into the pit.--*book_bug_2*",

    "Come, we will go back before it is too late.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But first, another drink to keep us warm.'--*book_bug_2*",

    "His eyes were even brighter, and he laughed--*book_bug_2*",
    "\n'Now, let's go on to the Amontillado,' he said.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We went on, and down, and came into the deepest vault.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Around three walls, from floor to ceiling, were the bones of the dead.--*book_bug_2*",

    "He went inside and I followed him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "In three steps he was at the back wall of the vault, and he stood there, looking stupid.--*book_bug_2*",
    "On the wall were two metal rings and a chain with a lock.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Before he could do anything, I put the chain around him and locked it to the rings.--*book_bug_2*",

    "No?Then I must leave you.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But first I must try to make you comfortable.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "I took them across to the small vault and began to work quickly--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nBefore the wall was half a metre high, Fortunato began to make soft crying noises.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then he was silent for some time.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I worked on busily, building the wall higher and higher.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He was pulling the chain and shaking it, but I knew the lock was strong.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The wall was now as high as my neck.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I held my torch higher, to see his face.--*book_bug_2*",

    "She fought wildly to get out of her coffin, they said, until it fell and broke open.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She then used a piece of the broken coffin to hit the metal doors of the vault.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But nobody heard her, or her screams for help.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then perhaps she fainted, or even died of terror.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Her burial dress caught on some metalwork, which stopped her falling.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And so she stayed, standing dead at the door, for three years.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And so she stayed, standing dead at the door, for three years.--*book_bug_2*",
    "How often are people buried alive?--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nThere are many true stories about premature burials.--*book_bug_2*",
    "For some years I had an illness called catalepsy.--*book_bug_2*",

    "When a cataleptic fit started, I always felt cold and ill, and then I fainted.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I always woke up very slowly \u2013 and I could never remember anything about the fit.--*book_bug_2*",
    "My body itself was well and strong, but I began to worry more and more.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I talked all the time about coffins and graves.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Day and night my thoughts were about premature burial.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I was afraid of sleeping \u2013 and afraid of waking up in a grave.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And when at last I did fall asleep, my dreams were about the terrors of death.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Once I dreamed that I was in a long cataleptic fit--*book_bug_2*",
    " A cold hand touched my face, and a voice in my ear said softly, 'Get up!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "I sat up.Everything was dark and I could not see the speaker.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Where was I?The cold hand started to shake my arm, and the voice said, 'Get up!--*book_bug_2*",
    "I asked.'I have no name in the place where I live,' said the voice.--*book_bug_2*",

    "Get up!Come with me into the night, and I will show you the graves of the dead.'--*book_bug_2*",

    "She showed me a curtain in a corner of the room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There was another, smaller bed for a child behind it--*book_bug_2*",
    " So she was in the room before I came!--*book_bug_2*",
    "But where did she come from, and who was her mother?--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Okay, I'll take you to your mother,' I said.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Suddenly the girl began to speak in Italian.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I said.I could understand Italian, but I spoke in English.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Allegra said angrily, speaking in English again.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I want to see her before I die.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Pap\u00e0 didn't like Mam\u00e0 and he took me away from her.--*book_bug_2*",

    "I wanted to see her and she wanted to see me too.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Oh, I must see her before I die!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Again I couldn't understand why she spoke in the past.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Was this all a little girl's fantasy?--*book_bug_2*",
    "I decided to ask her some questions.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I wanted to show this little girl to Chiara.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I took the girl's cold little hand but she wouldn't come.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'My dear Mam\u00e0 is at Bagno a Ripoli near Florence.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I'll go downstairs and bring my friend.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Wait here.'I found Chiara in the long room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was reading a book in an armchair by the fire.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I told her that there was a girl in my room again.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She looked surprised and followed me upstairs.--*book_bug_2*",
    "My door was open and we went into the room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We looked everywhere but found nothing.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The only child in the house was Chiara's daughter.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'She's sleeping in her bed,' Chiara told me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There was a girl in my room a few minutes ago.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'\nThen I told Chiara everything about the girl.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I finished, she said:\n'Well, it's very strange.--*book_bug_2*",
    "My Allegra has got black hair and brown eyes.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And my husband didn't take her away from me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I know that he wants to take her away, but he can't.--*book_bug_2*",
    "You see, I don't love my husband any more, and so he doesn't live here with us.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But Allegra likes him a lot and I know that she wants to see him.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Next day I went for a walk with Allegra Henderson.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The big black dog came with us.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We walked down a hill and came to a little river with a bridge.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We stood on the bridge while Allegra dropped stones into the water and the dog tried to find them.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Listen.'And she spoke fast in Italian--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Yes.It's a convent school and the teachers are Italian nuns.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Look, Nero has got a stone in his mouth!--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Allegra, do you know a place called Bagno a Ripoli?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Oh, don't shake the water over us, Nero \u2014 you bad boy!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Allegra laughed.But she didn't laugh when I asked:\n'Where's your Daddy, Allegra?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "She didn't want to talk about it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I asked.'Because Mummy says that he wants to take me away from her.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "She looked at me for a second; then suddenly she began to cry.--*book_bug_2*",
    "she cried, sad and angry at the same time--*book_bug_2*",
    " 'I want to see him before I die!--*book_bug_2*",
    "She ran fast up the hill and Nero ran behind her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "My parents liked the villa so we stayed there for a week.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I said no, she was always very angry with me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And every day I talked and played with the dark-haired Allegra, Chiara's daughter.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I liked her a lot and she liked me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But she was like two different people.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Sometimes she spoke to me angrily, like the other Allegra in the night.--*book_bug_2*",
    "At other times she was a happy, sweet little girl of five again.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I often asked her why she thought that she was going to die.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She always answered with the same words: 'I know, I know.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "During that week's holiday I began to feel love for Allegra Henderson.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But there was the other Allegra who came at night.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Who was she?I didn't believe in ghosts, but I was beginning to think that she was a ghost--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nThe day before we left, I wrote some notes:\nALLEGRA HENDERSON\n\u2014 5 years old.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Tall, black hair, brown eyes, pale.--*book_bug_2*",
    "\u2014 Speaks English and Italian,but can't say 'r'.--*book_bug_2*",
    "\u2014 Wants to see her father, who lives in England.--*book_bug_2*",

    "\u2014 Wants to see her mother, but her father says no.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I read these notes lots of times, but they didn't help me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then I saw that I didn't know anything about the ghost Allegra's father.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So I decided to ask her that night, which was our last night at the villa.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I didn't sleep much that night; I waited and waited.--*book_bug_2*",
    "No, she didn't come and I was angry!--*book_bug_2*",
    "I felt sure that her father was important.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I said goodbye to Allegra, I felt sad.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was sad too, and she gave me a kiss--*book_bug_2*",
    "\n'I hope that one day you will see your Daddy,' I said to her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Oh no,' she answered in a strange voice.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He was a famous lord and he took me away from my Mam\u00e0.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Chiara said.'Your father isn't a lord and he isn't dead!--*book_bug_2*",
    "But Allegra only smiled; a sad smile.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And that was the last time I saw her.--*book_bug_2*",

    "She didn't answer my letters but I said to myself, 'Well, she's only five.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Perhaps she can't write letters yet.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then a year after our holiday in Italy a letter arrived from Margaret Henderson.--*book_bug_2*",
    "First she thanked me for my letters and presents.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then she wrote:\nI'm sorry that we didn't write to you, but it has been a very bad year for us.--*book_bug_2*",
    "A week after your holiday our little Allegra got a fever.--*book_bug_2*",
    "A few days later the fever was worse and we called the doctor.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He said that he wasn't sure what the fever was.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Perhaps she drank some bad water or ate food that was bad,' he told us.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He gave her some medicine and she was better.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But then the fever returned very quickly.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We couldn't find the doctor and when he arrived, it was too late.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Our dear little Allegra died on April 21st a year ago.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Oh, it's like a terrible dream!--*book_bug_2*",
    "Our darling child was only five years and three months old--*book_bug_2*",
    " Now she has gone and she will never come back to us!--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I read this, I was shocked.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Allegra dead!I felt very sad and I began to cry.--*book_bug_2*",
    "For a long time I just couldn't believe it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I remembered her face, her voice, and her child's talk.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Allegra came back to me like a ghost and I was very unhappy.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And I often thought about Allegra's strange words: 'I want to see my Daddy before I die.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "How did she know that she was going to die?--*book_bug_2*",
    "And then there was the ghost Allegra in my room, saying, 'I want to see my Mam\u00e0 before I die.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "I wanted to find the answer to this mystery.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But how?In spring I went to Italy for my studies and I stayed in Florence with an Italian family.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When they told me her name, I couldn't believe my ears.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'We wanted a different name,' the mother told me, 'a name that you don't often find in Italy.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It's a beautiful name and we hoped that she would be a happy child.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was tall; her face was pale and beautiful.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She had long brown hair and brown eyes.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Five?Are you sure \u2014 I mean, is she?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "The mother looked at me strangely.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'In January.Why?''But please tell me the exact day.--*book_bug_2*",
    "You see, I'd like to buy her a present next year.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'She was born on January 21st.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I went to my room that night, I was afraid and I didn't go to bed.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She died on April 21st when she was five years and three months old.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So she was born on January 21st too!--*book_bug_2*",
    "Was it possible that this Italian Allegra had the same name, the same birthday, the same age?--*book_bug_2*",
    "I couldn't sleep so I tried to read a book about some English poets in Italy.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I was waiting, waiting...\nShe came at midnight.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I looked at my watch and then she was there in a dark corner of the room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "A beautiful, blond child, her skin like milk, her eyes like the blue of an Italian sky.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She wore a long white nightdress.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I was very afraid now and I shouted, 'Go away!--*book_bug_2*",
    "Go away!'But she came and stood by my armchair.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'I want to see Mam\u00e0 before I die.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I ran out of that room very fast.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Next morning I decided to go to Bagno a Ripoli.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I drove there in my small Fiat 500.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There were only a few houses, and a small church called Santa Maria dell'Antella.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I went into the church but there was nothing special about it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then I walked around the small cemetery behind it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But I didn't see anything different so I decided to go back to Florence.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When I was going out of the cemetery, I saw a tombstone with some English words on it.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I was very surprised but I still didn't understand anything.--*book_bug_2*",
    "In Florence that afternoon I decided to go to a bar and read the book about the English poets.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And while I was reading about Byron and Shelley, I began to understand the mystery of Allegra--*book_bug_2*",
    "The baby's father was the poet Lord Byron, but he was not Claire's husband.--*book_bug_2*",
    "They were lovers for a while but then Byron went to Italy.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He did not love Claire and he did not want to be with her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So Claire lived with Byron's friends \u2014 the poet Shelley, his wife Mary, and their two children.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Claire and Mary were half-sisters; they had the same father but different mothers.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Shelley liked children very much and he felt a strong love for Claire's baby.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He hoped that his friend Byron would help Claire and her daughter--*book_bug_2*",
    " From Bath he wrote to him:\nClaire has a very beautiful girl.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Her hair is fair and her eyes are blue... Claire calls her Alba.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Byron wanted to see his baby daughter and he asked Shelley to bring her to Italy.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The baby was a year old and now she was called Allegra because Byron liked the name.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Shelley said to her: 'No, don't do it, Claire, or you will never see your daughter again.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "But Byron was rich and Claire thought that Allegra would have a better life with him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "In a letter to a friend she wrote:\nIn the spring of 1818 I sent my little darling to her father.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was the only thing that I loved in the world.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It was a terrible mistake.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Allegra lived with her father in a big house called the Palazzo Mocenigo.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It was full of strange animals, and even stranger people.--*book_bug_2*",
    "After a while Lord Byron understood that it was not a good home for a child.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So he gave Allegra to an English family in Venice, and in August Claire saw her there.--*book_bug_2*",
    "For two months Claire was happy there with Allegra.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But Byron also said that she must bring Allegra to him in Venice in the autumn.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So in October Allegra went back to her father, and Claire never saw her again--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nAllegra stayed in Venice for eight months with different families.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then Byron took her to the city of Bologna.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He wrote to Shelley:\nShe is like me.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Her voice is soft and she can't say the letter 'r'.--*book_bug_2*",
    "For many months he sent no news to Claire about her daughter.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then she heard that Allegra was with her father in a town called Ravenna.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She wrote to him, 'I want to see my daughter \u2014 please!'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Claire wrote a lot of letters like this to Byron, but he did not answer them.--*book_bug_2*",
    "When Allegra was four years old, Byron sent her to a convent school near Ravenna.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The nuns were kind and loved her very much.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Every day she did the same things at the same time.--*book_bug_2*",
    "This quiet life was very different from her life with Byron.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She did not like convent schools, and she was sure that Allegra was always cold and lonely.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She wrote an angry letter to Byron: 'My child must be with one of her parents,' she said.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He did not answer the letter.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But he said that Shelley could see Allegra because he was his friend.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So one day Shelley went to visit Allegra at the convent--*book_bug_2*",
    " He wrote in his diary:\nShe is tall and pale.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But her eyes are very blue, and she has a lot of blond hair.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She is beautiful and very different from the other children.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I ran and played with her in the garden.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I gave her some sweets and I asked her, 'What shall I say to your Mam\u00e0?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "She answered in Italian, 'Tell her to send me a kiss and a beautiful dress.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then I asked her, 'What shall I say to your Pap\u00e0?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "But Pap\u00e0 did not visit her and Mam\u00e0 did not come.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Of course, Claire wanted to go to the convent and take Allegra away, but this was very difficult.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Byron was a rich and famous lord and the people in the convent did what he wanted.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The doctor came and gave her some medicine.--*book_bug_2*",
    "For a while she was better and the nuns hoped that she would live.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But she died on April 21st 1822.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was five years and three months old--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nShelley was afraid to tell Claire that Allegra was dead.--*book_bug_2*",
    "At once everybody stopped talking, and she knew.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was very unhappy and wanted to die.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He loved Allegra like a daughter and he could not forget her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Two weeks after Allegra died, he was with one of his friends on the balcony of a house by the sea.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Suddenly he saw a child with long, fair hair and very blue eyes.--*book_bug_2*",
    "She was coming out of the sea and she was smiling at him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "In the moonlight he saw that she wanted to come to him.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And fifty years after Allegra died, Claire wrote to a friend:\nI can never forget my darling child.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Byron and Shelley said that she died, but I have heard that she is alive.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Some people say that they have seen her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I am sure that she is alive--*book_bug_2*",
    "\nClaire died in 1879 when she was eighty-one years old.--*book_bug_2*",

    "She knew that her mother was at Bagno a Ripoli, but she didn't know how to get there.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So her unhappy ghost lived and waited in the body of Allegra Henderson, Chiara's daughter.--*book_bug_2*",

    "It's for calling a servant, but Julia and I never used it because we didn't have any servants.--*book_bug_2*",

    "'Now, Miss Stoner,' he said, 'I think your life is in danger.--*book_bug_2*",

    "'I must find out more before I tell you, Miss Stoner.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Now goodbye, and don't be afraid,' replied Sherlock Holmes.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We walked to the village, and Holmes said to me, 'Tonight will be dangerous, Watson.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Roylott is a very violent man--*book_bug_2*",
    "'\n'But if I can help, Holmes, I shall come with you,' I said.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I knew about the air-vent before we came.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Of course there is a hole between the two rooms.--*book_bug_2*",
    "That explains why Helen's sister could smell Dr Roylott's cigarette.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "I cried.'And did you see the bed?--*book_bug_2*",
    "It must stay under the rope, which is near the air-vent.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Yes, this doctor is a very clever man.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But we can stop him, I think, Watson.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "When we saw Helen Stoner's light, Holmes and I got in quietly through the window.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then we waited silently in the middle bedroom in the dark.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We waited for three hours and did not move.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Suddenly we saw a light and heard a sound from Dr Roylott's room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But nothing happened, and again we waited in the dark.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There was a quiet whistle.--*book_bug_2*",
    "We both looked up at the air-vent, and suddenly we heard a terrible cry in the next room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then the house was silent again.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Roylott was sitting on a chair, and his eyes were fixed on the air-vent.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Round his head was a strange, yellow speckled band.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The band moved and began to turn its head.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It's a snake, an Indian snake \u2014 and its poison can kill very quickly,' Holmes cried.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'Roylott died immediately.We must put the snake back in its box.'--*book_bug_2*",
    "Very, very carefully, Holmes took the snake and threw it into the metal box.--*book_bug_2*",
    "'But how did you know about the snake, Holmes?'--*book_bug_2*",
    "I asked.'At first, Watson, I thought that it was the gipsies.--*book_bug_2*",
    "I thought that perhaps something came through the air-vent, down the bell-rope and on to the bed.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Then there was the milk \u2014 and of course, snakes drink milk.--*book_bug_2*",
    "It was easy for the Doctor to get Indian animals.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And because he was a doctor, he knew that this snake's poison is difficult to find in a dead body.--*book_bug_2*",
    "So every night he put the snake through the air-vent, and it went down the bell-rope onto the bed.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Of course, nobody must see the snake, so every night he whistled to call it back.--*book_bug_2*",
    "The sound of metal falling was the door of the metal box, which was the snake's home.--*book_bug_2*",
    "Perhaps the snake came through the air-vent many times before it killed Julia.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But in the end it killed her.--*book_bug_2*",
    "And Helen, too, nearly died because of this snake--*book_bug_2*",
    "\n'But tonight, when I hit the snake on the rope, it was angry and went back through the air-vent.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But she never really forgot the speckled band--*book_bug_2*",
    "He did not love her, because he never loved women.--*book_bug_2*",
    "But after their meeting he never forgot her.--*book_bug_2*",

    "Be in your room at 7.45 p.m. '\n'The paper \u2014 what do you think about the paper?'--*book_bug_2*",

    "This will be interesting,' my friend answered.--*book_bug_2*",
    "There was a knock at the door--*book_bug_2*",
    "A tall, strong man came into the room.--*book_bug_2*",
    "He was wearing expensive clothes, and a mask over his face.--*book_bug_2*",

    "'That is very good news,' said the Mole seriously.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Very good indeed,' the Rat said, watching Toad's face carefully.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "So Toad, fighting and shouting, was pulled upstairs by his two friends.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "But Toad did not seem to get better.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "But how are you , and the excellent Mole, and dear old Badger?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Badger and Mole,' he added, perhaps not very sensibly, 'have gone out for a run round.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They'll be out until lunch-time, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I don't want you to trouble yourself about me,' Toad said, in a sad little voice.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I was wondering if you would go down to the village and fetch the doctor.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But no, it's not important.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It's probably too late by now.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But you mustn't be sad, Ratty.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Toad lay so still and quiet \u2014 perhaps he really was ill.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The Rat wished that the other two were not so far away.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He looked again at the still and silent Toad, and decided that he must get the doctor at once.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nWhen Toad heard the front door bang, he jumped out of bed, laughing loudly.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He quickly put on his best suit and filled his pockets with money.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A few hours later he was a long way from home.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "As he walked happily along the road, he felt very pleased with himself.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'A clever piece of work, that was!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Poor old Ratty!A good fellow, but not very intelligent.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Badger will be so angry with him!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Soon he came to a small town and decided to have lunch in the pub there.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was very hungry after his long walk.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Halfway through his meal, he heard a sound that he knew very well indeed.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Poop-poop!The car stopped outside and the people in it came into the pub to have lunch.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Shaking with excitement, Toad paid his bill and hurried out.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He walked slowly round the car, looking at it lovingly.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Everybody was having lunch and the street was empty--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "forgetting everything except this wonderful, beautiful madness.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "'Why do you use it most on poor people?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "said Scrooge.'Because poor people need it most,' was the reply.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They went on through London, and came to the small house where Scrooge's clerk lived.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Here the spirit smiled, and held his torch high over the door.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "And then, the most exciting moment of the day!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Oh, it was a wonderful pudding!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'It's your greatest success in all the years that we've been married, my dear!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "But this did not worry the Cratchits at all--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    " Now Bob lifted his glass and said, 'A merry Christmas to us all, my dears!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "'If his life does not change soon, he will die before next Christmas.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There are too many people in the world, so it's a good thing if some of them die.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    " 'Let's drink to Mr Scrooge, whose money has paid for this meal!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'What can we buy with his fifteen shillings a week?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "'My dear,' said Bob gently, 'remember it's Christmas.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Well, Bob, I'll drink to his health only because of you and because it's Christmas.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A merry Christmas and a happy new year to him!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "The spirit did not stay long here, but told Scrooge to hold his robe again.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Not up in the air, surely!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And Scrooge, terribly frightened, looked down as they flew over the land and then over the sea.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was stormy, windy weather, and the waves crashed violently underneath them.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The spirit took Scrooge to a lighthouse built on a lonely rock, several miles from land.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A light was kept burning at the top, in order to warn sailors to keep away from the dangerous rocks.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Again the spirit and Scrooge flew on, and together they landed on a ship in the middle of the sea.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When Scrooge's nephew laughed, everybody who was with him wanted to laugh too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And at the moment, his very pretty wife and several of his friends were laughing with him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "said his wife.'He's a strange old man,' said Scrooge's nephew, 'but I'm sorry for him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "His money is no use to him, you see.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He isn't at all happy or comfortable, although he's rich.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It's sad to think of him sitting alone in his cold room.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And so I'm going to invite him every Christmas.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "After tea, the cheerful little group sang songs, and played music.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Later the friends played guessing games, and Scrooge joined in the games with delight.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Nobody except the spirit could hear him, but he often guessed the right answer--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Look, they're playing a new game!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The only possible answers were Yes or No.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Every time he answered a question, Fred could not stop himself laughing.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At last, his wife's dark, pretty sister started laughing too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A merry Christmas and a happy new year to the old man!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "they all cried, cheerfully lifting their glasses.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Uncle Scrooge wanted to thank them, but the spirit hurried him away.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "The church clock was striking the three quarters.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Excuse me for asking, spirit,' said Scrooge, 'but what are those strange things near your foot?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "said the spirit sadly, and brought out from under his robe two ghostly figures, a boy and a girl.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Scrooge had never seen anything so terrible or so sad.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "On my second day in the round-house, he looked at me with a white face and fear in his eyes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "he asked.'No, sir,' I replied.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Yes, I thought so,' and sitting down, he called for some more whisky.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "But I could not forget poor Ransome.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "As the days passed, I became more and more worried.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "As we watched, the boat broke in two, and went to the bottom with all its.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was smallish but well-built, with an open, sunburnt face, and bright, amused eyes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Hoseason was looking with interest at the man's clothes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'I'm sorry about the boat, sir,' said the captain.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I know, because I've been in France, like you.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He said these last words clearly and carefully.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They seemed to have a special meaning.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The stranger put his hand quickly on his pistol.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And I must tell you another thing.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "If King George's soldiers find me, I'll be in trouble.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I was on my way to France, where some of my clansmen live now.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But in the fog my boat missed the French ship that was meeting me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So if you can take me to France, I'll pay you well--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'\nHe opened his purse and showed that it was full of gold coins.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The captain seemed excited as he looked at the money, and then at the man's face.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There the Highlander would be among friends, and safe from the English army.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He and Hoseason shook hands, and the captain left me alone with the stranger.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He had told the captain that the gold was not his own.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I thought he was very brave.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'If he's caught by the English army, they'll kill him!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I told myself.I liked the way he seemed to enjoy living dangerously--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nWhen he asked me for whisky, I had to go to ask the captain for the key to the cupboard.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I went slowly back to the stranger, not sure what I should do.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But when I entered the round-house, and saw him eating his supper, I decided at once.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I will!I'm no thief or murderer!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I replied bravely.'Are ye for King George?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "'Now, David, I'll take any man who comes in through this door.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "You must watch the window, and the door behind me, and shoot anyone who tries to enter--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'\nHe gave me a pistol.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I was very frightened, but tried hard not to show it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Suddenly there was the sound of running feet, and a shout, and then I heard fighting in the doorway.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I looked over my shoulder, and saw Mr Shuan, just as Alan drove his sword into the officer's body.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then several men ran at my door.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I did not want to hurt them, but it was now or never.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I lifted my pistol and shot at them.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "I stood there in the open, on the hill, while the soldiers lifted their guns, ready to shoot.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "In the shadow of the trees, I found Alan Breck standing there.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was he who had spoken to me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "feeling a desire or need to drink.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Come!'Alan said, and started running along the side of the hill, keeping low to the ground.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I followed him like a sheep.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We ran and ran, faster than I had ever run before, and my heart was beating wildly.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nAfter fifteen minutes, Alan stopped, lay flat in the heather, and turned to me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "At last we arrived back in the wood where I had found Alan.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We fell down in the heather, and lay without moving for a long time.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "My legs hurt, my head was aching, and I thought I was dead.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Well.'he said, 'that was hot work, David.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I said nothing.I had seen murder done.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I knew that Colin Campbell had been Alan's greatest enemy, and I had found Alan hiding in the wood.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "he asked.'No,' I replied, my face turned away from him, 'no, I'm not tired now.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan, I can't stay with you, I must leave you.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I liked you very much, but we're two different people, that's all--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'\n'Ye must explain what ye mean by that, David,' said Alan, looking very serious.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "You know very well that Colin Campbell is lying dead in the road in his own blood.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He did not appear to see it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I don't know why ye're so worried about a dead Campbell,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I know that you hate their clan, Alan, but taking a life in cold blood is a terrible thing to do.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Do you know who did it?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "These Highlanders were strange, wild people, to be sure.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But Alan was ready to die for what he thought was right, and I liked him for that.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I offered him my hand again, and this time he took it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Now, David,' he said, 'we must escape too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The Campbells will accuse us both of the murder.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I cried.'We can prove that in court!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When the Campbell lawyers have finished with ye, ye'll be dead!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'But remember,' said Alan, 'it'll be a hard life.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Ye'll have to sleep in the open air, and ye'll often have an empty stomach.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Ye can choose \u2014 either live in the heather with me, or die at the hands of the Campbells.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'That's easy to decide,' I said, and we shook hands on it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nWe walked for several hours, and arrived that night at a large house in a valley.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There were lights in all the windows, and people were running in and out of the open doors.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'This is a terrible accident,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'It will bring trouble to all of us!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Well, man,' said Alan, 'ye should be grateful that Colin Campbell is dead!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And I'm a man with a family!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Some were hiding guns and swords, while others were burning papers.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'\nWe went inside, and met James's wife and children, who were crying in a corner.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I felt very sorry for them, but we did not have much time to talk.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We needed money too, because Alan had given his gold to another man to take to France.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But James had only a little to give us.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Ye must find a safe place somewhere near,' he said, 'and send me a message.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I'll find some more money for ye, and send it to ye.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'And I'll have to accuse your friend from the Lowlands too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    " James!I brought him here, and now my friends accuse him of murder!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "cried James.'The Campbells will be sure to accuse him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Well, sir,' said Alan, turning to me, 'what do ye say?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "If ye do not agree, I won't let James do it.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I am Alan's friend, and if I can help his friends in any way, I don't mind the danger.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So that night we started our long journey to the Lowlands.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'The soldiers will find us easily here,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He looked around, and saw a great rock, about seven metres high.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "With difficulty we both climbed to the top of it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then I saw why he had chosen it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'If they go up the sides of the mountains, they'll see us,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'We'll just have to stay here and hope they don't.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When it's dark, we'll try to get past them.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We lay on the rock, baking in the sun, with no water, only whisky, to drink.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We continued walking eastwards all night, over the great dark mountains.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan was very pleased that we had left the soldiers behind, and whistled happily as he walked--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan went down one night to the nearest village, to the house of one of his clansmen.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And there was a price of one hundred pounds on my head, as well as on Alan's.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I began to think that I would be safer alone.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan was very recognizable in his fine French clothes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was going to be dangerous to stay with Alan, and expensive, too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Mrs Stewart had only managed to send five pounds, and Alan had to travel as far as France.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Staying with Alan meant both danger and expense--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nBut my honest friend did not think in this way at all.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He felt sure that he was helping me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So what could I do, except keep quiet, and hope that everything would be all right?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was another hot summer day, and my back ached badly after a few hours.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We walked or ran all day and all night.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "People who talk of tiredness do not know what the word really means.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I did not know who I was or where I was going, and I did not care.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I thought that every step would be my last, and I hoped that death would come soon.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan drove me onwards, and I felt that I hated him, but I was too afraid of him to stop and rest.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When daylight returned, we were stupid with tiredness, and had become careless.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Suddenly, three or four wild-looking men jumped out of the heather, and took us prisoner.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I was not afraid, only happy to stop running for a moment.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'These are Cluny Macpherson's men,' he said quietly to me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They fought well against the English in the Forty-Five.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "After that, he didn't go to France, like the other clan chiefs.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "No, he's been hiding here ever since, and the soldiers have never managed to find him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He seemed to live well in his cave, and he offered us an excellent meal, prepared by his cook.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Bur I was too tired to eat, so I lay down at once and slept.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "In fact, although I did not know it, I was seriously ill, and could not get up for two days.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I was too sick and sleepy to refuse, and gave him my purse.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But when I woke up again, on the third day, I felt much better, although not very strong.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I noticed that Alan was looking very ashamed, and I realized at once what had happened--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'David,' he said miserably, 'I've lost all our money at cards, yours as well as mine.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "cried Cluny.'Of course I'll give your money back.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was just a game.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Here!'And he pulled gold coins out of his pocket.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At first Alan tried hard to talk to me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He said that he was sorry, and that he loved me like a brother.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was worried about my health, and offered me a hand when we crossed a river or climbed a hill.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We travelled by night, through endless rain and strong winds, and slept in the wet heather by day.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I was feeling more and more miserable.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Alan will be sorry when I die!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan continued to laugh at me and call me names, and by the sixth night I had had enough.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Mr Stewart,' I said, 'why do you laugh at me?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "You may have a king's name, but you're a loser!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "You're not brave enough to fight the Campbells and the English, and win!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'There are things that ye should never say \u2014 things that can never be for gotten!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'If you don't like what I say, I'm ready to fight,' I answered stupidly.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I knew that I was not strong enough to hold a sword.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Are ye crazy?I cannot fight ye!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He pulled out his sword, and looked at me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'No, I can't, I can't,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And he dropped his sword on the ground.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When I saw how much he loved me, I was no longer angry, only sick, and sorry.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I remembered all his kindness to me, and how he had always helped me through difficult times.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Now I had lost that friend forever!--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "My illness seemed to get worse and worse, and I could only just stand.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I wanted to say that I was sorry, but I knew it was too late for that.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Suddenly I realized that a cry for help was the only way of bringing Alan back to me--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'If you cannot help me, I must just die here!'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I did not need to pretend.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He looked up quickly, surprised.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Not without help.Alan, if I die, will you forget what I said?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "In my heart, I've always been your friend, you know that.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "David, man, ye know...' He could not go on, but put his arm around me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There I 1ay for several days, unable to move.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Alan refused to leave me, and took the greatest care of me.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "We did not see any more soldiers, and our journey was easier now.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "He had now sold the lifeboat and brought all his business in Llandudno to an end.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He had very little luggage, but he did have a new hat-box.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When Denry got home, he was pleased to see his mother again.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She had often collected his rents for him during the summer, and had done it very well.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "She could see coins running all over the floor.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At last they stopped moving, and then it was silent.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "For once in her life his mother could not find a word to say.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nFor several days afterwards Mrs Machin was still picking up coins.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "He had come back from the Llandudno adventure with a thousand pounds.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Two years later he had two thousand pounds, and his bank manager spoke to him with great politeness.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Denry now rented a small office, and employed an office-boy--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nHe also bought a mule and cart.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He said he needed them for his work.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He could, of course, collect rents on a bicycle, and a bicycle doesn't eat much, or run away.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was a good advertisement for his business.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But he wanted more than money.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Every week customers paid a few pence into the club.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At Christmas the customers could spend all the money they had paid in.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Denry's idea was for a savings club for every shop in the Five Towns.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It was a fantastic idea.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Denry's savings club was special in one very important way.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nDenry needed to make a profit, of course, and his profit would come from the shops.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "He started by going to Bostocks, the biggest clothes shop in the Five Towns.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "With Bostocks' name on the list it was easier to find other shops.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "In two weeks he had nearly a hundred.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Now he needed something to give the club a good start.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then he had an idea.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He could ask the Countess of Chell to be the patron of his club.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Hers was the best possible name to have at the top of his letter paper.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She was the richest woman in the Five Towns.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Some people loved her and some people hated her, but everybody knew her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "I'll have her as a patron,' he said to himself.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So one morning he arrived, without his mule, at the home of the Countess of Chell.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But today the gardens were empty--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nIt was a long walk between the trees up to the house, and a long walk up the steps.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "I'm leaving in a few minutes.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then, through an open door in the back of the house he saw a man.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Jock had disappeared.Denry tried the big doors, but they were all locked.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He went back to the door he had used to come into the room.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But strangely, that was now locked as well.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then he heard horses outside, and running to a window, he saw the Countess's carriage driving away--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nDenry tried knocking on all the doors, first politely, then noisily.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He tried calling out, then shouting as loudly as he could.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Nothing.At last he realized that there was nobody to hear him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was a prisoner in an empty house.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The only possible escape was to break a window, so Denry preferred to wait until night.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He spent a long afternoon in the great ballroom of Sneyd Hall, looking at pictures and furniture.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When night fell, he broke one of the big windows and went home.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The Five Towns Savings Club began life without the Countess.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "And because nothing was stolen, the police were not very interested.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Indeed, a week or two later, Denry saw a chance to make something out of his adventure.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "All that long afternoon he had been in the great ballroom, and he had used his eyes well.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "First: Denry called one day at the house of Mrs Kemp in Brougham Street.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Mrs Kemp was the mother of Jock, Denry's old friend and carriage-driver to the Countess.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Second: a day or two later, Jock came to visit his mother, and Denry also came to visit.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Fourth: about five minutes later, Denry drove past in his mule cart, wearing his best clothes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "\n'Good afternoon, Countess,' said Denry, lifting his hat.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "It was five kilometres to Hanbridge, and they were there in seventeen minutes.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There were several hundred policemen outside the Police Club, waiting for the Countess.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He hit the mule over the head with his whip.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The mule dashed off, but away from the Police Club.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They hit another cart, full of vegetables, and turned it over.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "They dashed down a hill, fast.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Then the Countess noticed that Denry was not using his right arm--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'I think I broke it when we hit the cart,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Denry managed to turn the mule into Birches Street, which went up a hill.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The mule slowed down, then stopped.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "But it still had not arrived.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I can take you home in my cart,' offered Denry.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I think I'll wait,' said the Countess.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Well, let's go and have a cup of tea while we're waiting,' said Denry.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The Countess loved tea, and they were soon sitting in a corner of the tea-shop.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'How did you get all that information about the rooms at Sneyd Hall?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "In a few days a thousand more people had joined the Club.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Denry had no more worries about money.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'Yes,' he said, walking into the living room.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "These days he was a great man in the Five Towns, but his greatness was nothing in Brougham Street.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "'I hope so, Charlie, but you are very ill indeed.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When Dr Bell said that, Charles looked frightened.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Then he said: 'When I'm dead, Royes, look after Florence for me, will you?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At the Coroner's enquiry in July, some of the lawyers said that Florence killed her husband.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But Charles's cousin, Dr Royes Bell, didn't believe that.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Charles loved his wife, he told the lawyers.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And on Thursday 20th April she sent for a fifth doctor, Dr William Gull.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Dr Gull was very famous and important, and was the doctor to Queen Victoria herself.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He arrived at The Priory at six o'clock on Thursday evening.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Charles Bravo was still alive, but he was very seriously ill--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'Mr Bravo, you have taken poison,' Dr Gull told him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'Please tell me, who gave it to you?'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I took it myself,' Charles Bravo said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Dr Gull asked.'Laudanum,' Charles Bravo replied.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I took some laudanum because I had toothache.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'A little laudanum can't kill you, Mr Bravo,' Dr Gull said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "You are very ill, you are going to die.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "It's important that you tell me the truth.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "If someone gave it to you, they wanted to kill you.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Charles Bravo shook his head slowly.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'It was only laudanum, doctor,' he said.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "That was the last thing he said to Dr Gull.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A few hours later, Charles Bravo died.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Five different doctors had seen him, and he told them all the same story.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He had taken laudanum, he said, and then called for hot water to make himself sick.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Dr Gull asked.'Out of the window,' said Dr Johnson.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Dr Gull sent it to Professor Redwood, a famous scientist, in London.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Professor Redwood looked at it carefully--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\n'The poison was antimony,' the Professor told the Coroner later.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I found ten grains of it in the vomit in the glass bottle.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "There were probably thirty grains in his body.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I found ten grains of antimony.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The antimony destroyed Charles Bravo's stomach.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He died very slowly, in great pain.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But how did the antimony get into his stomach?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Antimony is a white powder.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Every evening, Charles Bravo drank from the bottle of water beside his bed.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The antimony was probably in the bottle.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But who put the antimony in the water?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'No one else killed Charles Bravo,' he told Florence's father, Mr Campbell.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'\nBut Charles's stepfather, Joseph Bravo, didn't agree.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "He was murdered with the poison antimony.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But it is impossible to say which person \u2013 or persons \u2013 killed him.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And if so, who killed Charles Bravo?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Over the years since 1876, many books and television programmes have asked these questions.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But they have all given different answers.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Perhaps there was some antimony left there \u2013 and someone found it, and used it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Or perhaps the antimony didn't come from the stables at all--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nHere are the four main possible answers to the mystery.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was young and healthy, he seemed happy, he had a rich wife \u2013 he had every reason to live.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And to die from antimony is a very painful, horrible death.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But perhaps he killed himself by accident.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Is that possible?Think about it.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Charles Bravo was not a very nice man.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He married Florence for her money, not because he loved her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She drank a lot of wine, and he didn't like that.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Maybe he found the antimony in the stables, and put a little in her wine, to stop her drinking.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "After all, Florence did that to her first husband.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Mrs Cox said he told her: 'I have taken some of that poison.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And did Mrs Cox know which poison he was talking about?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Probably not.She told Dr Harrison he had taken chloroform--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "'I only took laudanum, nothing else,' he told them.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Did Dr Gully write that letter to Charles Bravo saying: 'You don't love her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "?Charles Bravo certainly thought so.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Dr Gully certainly wrote to Mrs Cox, and sent her medicine for her mother.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was a doctor, he could easily buy antimony if he wanted.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And maybe he thought: 'If Charles Bravo is dead, then Florence will come back to me.'--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "No one saw him there; he hadn't been inside the house for months.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But perhaps he did buy the antimony.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And perhaps another person put it in the water bottle--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "The last years of his life were unhappy.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "No other doctors would speak to him or read his books.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He didn't spend much time with Florence, either.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She wasn't interested in him any more.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She knew and liked Dr Gully but she thought he was too old for Florence.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So she introduced her to a younger man, Charles Bravo.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "At first she thought Charles was a good husband for Florence, but she soon changed her mind.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He was angry and unkind; he hit Florence when she argued with him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "He got rid of many servants, and he tried to get rid of Jane Cox, too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So Jane Cox would lose her friend, and her job.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She had three sons at school \u2013 how would she pay for them?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Mrs Cox knew Charles Bravo drank from his water bottle every night.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She could easily go into his bedroom and put antimony in the bottle--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nThere are many questions about Jane Cox.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "When Charles opened his bedroom door, shouting for hot water, why didn't Mrs Cox come out?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But she did nothing until the maid, Mary Ann, came to fetch her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And then, when she went into Charles's bedroom, she sent Mary Ann out, again and again.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Why?Because she wanted to be alone with Charles, perhaps?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Burn the rest of the antimony on the fire?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Clean out the water bottle, to make sure there were no grains of antimony left inside?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Why did she send for Dr Harrison, when Dr Moore lived much closer?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Was she telling the truth, about what Charles said to her?--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Some people say that Mrs Cox did it, because she was afraid of losing her job.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She was a poor widow and needed the money.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But there is a problem with this, too.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Jane Cox's aunt, who lived in Jamaica, was very rich.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "A month before Charles Bravo died, this rich aunt had left all her money to Mrs Cox's sons--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nSo Jane Cox didn't really need a job any more.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "And after Charles's death, she stopped working for Florence.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She took her sons to Jamaica, and lived in a big house there.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She was a rich lady, and died in 1917, aged ninety.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Perhaps she did kill Charles Bravo.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But she didn't do it for the money.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "Florence was a very rich young woman.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She had a fine house, with lots of servants and horses.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "She liked to do things her own way.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "When a man married a woman, all her money belonged to him.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "If a wife argued with her husband, the husband often hit her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",

    "Dr Gully was the only man in her life who was kind to her.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "But she couldn't marry him, because he was too old and his wife was still alive.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "So she married Charles Bravo instead--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
    "\nShe was only married to Charles for five months.--*book_bug_3_nodrm*",
