    "Preface--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame de Paris--*Paris*",
    "Also known as:--*Paris*",
    "The Hunchback of Notre Dame--*Paris*",
    "by Victor Hugo--*Paris*",
    "A few years ago, while visiting or, rather, rummaging about Notre-Dame, the author of this book found, in an obscure nook of one of the towers, the following word, engraved by hand upon the wall:----*Paris*",
    "These Greek capitals, black with age, and quite deeply graven in the stone, with I know not what signs peculiar to Gothic caligraphy imprinted upon their forms and upon their attitudes, as though with the purpose of revealing that it had been a hand of the Middle Ages which had inscribed them there, and especially the fatal and melancholy meaning contained in them, struck the author deeply.--*Paris*",
    "He questioned himself; he sought to divine who could have been that soul in torment which had not been willing to quit this world without leaving this stigma of crime or unhappiness upon the brow of the ancient church.--*Paris*",
    "Afterwards, the wall was whitewashed or scraped down, I know not which, and the inscription disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "For it is thus that people have been in the habit of proceeding with the marvellous churches of the Middle Ages for the last two hundred years.--*Paris*",
    "Mutilations come to them from every quarter, from within as well as from without.--*Paris*",
    "The priest whitewashes them, the archdeacon scrapes them down; then the populace arrives and demolishes them.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, with the exception of the fragile memory which the author of this book here consecrates to it, there remains to-day nothing whatever of the mysterious word engraved within the gloomy tower of Notre-Dame,--nothing of the destiny which it so sadly summed up.--*Paris*",
    "The man who wrote that word upon the wall disappeared from the midst of the generations of man many centuries ago; the word, in its turn, has been effaced from the wall of the church; the church will, perhaps, itself soon disappear from the face of the earth.--*Paris*",
    "It is upon this word that this book is founded.--*Paris*",
    "March, 1831.--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 1 The Grand Hall--*Paris*",
    "Three hundred and forty-eight years, six months, and nineteen days ago to-day, the Parisians awoke to the sound of all the bells in the triple circuit of the city, the university, and the town ringing a full peal.--*Paris*",
    "The sixth of January, 1482, is not, however, a day of which history has preserved the memory.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing notable in the event which thus set the bells and the bourgeois of Paris in a ferment from early morning.--*Paris*",
    "It was neither an assault by the Picards nor the Burgundians, nor a hunt led along in procession, nor a revolt of scholars in the town of Laas, nor an entry of \"our much dread lord, monsieur the king,\" nor even a pretty hanging of male and female thieves by the courts of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Neither was it the arrival, so frequent in the fifteenth century, of some plumed and bedizened embassy.--*Paris*",
    "It was barely two days since the last cavalcade of that nature, that of the Flemish ambassadors charged with concluding the marriage between the dauphin and Marguerite of Flanders, had made its entry into Paris, to the great annoyance of M. le Cardinal de Bourbon, who, for the sake of pleasing the king, had been obliged to assume an amiable mien towards this whole rustic rabble of Flemish burgomasters, and to regale them at his H?tel de Bourbon, with a very \"pretty morality, allegorical satire, and farce,\" while a driving rain drenched the magnificent tapestries at his door.--*Paris*",
    "What put the \"whole population of Paris in commotion,\" as Jehan de Troyes expresses it, on the sixth of January, was the double solemnity, united from time immemorial, of the Epiphany and the Feast of Fools.--*Paris*",
    "On that day, there was to be a bonfire on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, a maypole at the Chapelle de Braque, and a mystery at the Palais de Justice.--*Paris*",
    "It had been cried, to the sound of the trumpet, the preceding evening at all the cross roads, by the provost's men, clad in handsome, short, sleeveless coats of violet camelot, with large white crosses upon their breasts.--*Paris*",
    "So the crowd of citizens, male and female, having closed their houses and shops, thronged from every direction, at early morn, towards some one of the three spots designated.--*Paris*",
    "Each had made his choice; one, the bonfire; another, the maypole; another, the mystery play.--*Paris*",
    "It must be stated, in honor of the good sense of the loungers of Paris, that the greater part of this crowd directed their steps towards the bonfire, which was quite in season, or towards the mystery play, which was to be presented in the grand hall of the Palais de Justice (the courts of law), which was well roofed and walled; and that the curious left the poor, scantily flowered maypole to shiver all alone beneath the sky of January, in the cemetery of the Chapel of Braque.--*Paris*",
    "The populace thronged the avenues of the law courts in particular, because they knew that the Flemish ambassadors, who had arrived two days previously, intended to be present at the representation of the mystery, and at the election of the Pope of the Fools, which was also to take place in the grand hall.--*Paris*",
    "It was no easy matter on that day, to force one's way into that grand hall, although it was then reputed to be the largest covered enclosure in the world (it is true that Sauval had not yet measured the grand hall of the Chateau of Montargis).--*Paris*",
    "The palace place, encumbered with people, offered to the curious gazers at the windows the aspect of a sea; into which five or six streets, like so many mouths of rivers, discharged every moment fresh floods of heads.--*Paris*",
    "The waves of this crowd, augmented incessantly, dashed against the angles of the houses which projected here and there, like so many promontories, into the irregular basin of the place.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre of the lofty Gothic* fa?ade of the palace, the grand staircase, incessantly ascended and descended by a double current, which, after parting on the intermediate landing-place, flowed in broad waves along its lateral slopes,--the grand staircase, I say, trickled incessantly into the place, like a cascade into a lake.--*Paris*",
    "The cries, the laughter, the trampling of those thousands of feet, produced a great noise and a great clamor.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time, this noise and clamor redoubled; the current which drove the crowd towards the grand staircase flowed backwards, became troubled, formed whirlpools.--*Paris*",
    "This was produced by the buffet of an archer, or the horse of one of the provost's sergeants, which kicked to restore order; an admirable tradition which the provostship has bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the ~mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e~, the ~mar\u00e9chauss\u00e9e~ to our ~gendarmeri~ of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Thousands of good, calm, bourgeois faces thronged the windows, the doors, the dormer windows, the roofs, gazing at the palace, gazing at the populace, and asking nothing more; for many Parisians content themselves with the spectacle of the spectators, and a wall behind which something is going on becomes at once, for us, a very curious thing indeed.--*Paris*",
    "If it could be granted to us, the men of 1830, to mingle in thought with those Parisians of the fifteenth century, and to enter with them, jostled, elbowed, pulled about, into that immense hall of the palace, which was so cramped on that sixth of January, 1482, the spectacle would not be devoid of either interest or charm, and we should have about us only things that were so old that they would seem new.--*Paris*",
    "With the reader's consent, we will endeavor to retrace in thought, the impression which he would have experienced in company with us on crossing the threshold of that grand hall, in the midst of that tumultuous crowd in surcoats, short, sleeveless jackets, and doublets.--*Paris*",
    "And, first of all, there is a buzzing in the ears, a dazzlement in the eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Above our heads is a double ogive vault, panelled with wood carving, painted azure, and sown with golden fleurs-de-lis; beneath our feet a pavement of black and white marble, alternating.--*Paris*",
    "A few paces distant, an enormous pillar, then another, then another; seven pillars in all, down the length of the hall, sustaining the spring of the arches of the double vault, in the centre of its width.--*Paris*",
    "Around four of the pillars, stalls of merchants, all sparkling with glass and tinsel; around the last three, benches of oak, worn and polished by the trunk hose of the litigants, and the robes of the attorneys.--*Paris*",
    "Around the hall, along the lofty wall, between the doors, between the windows, between the pillars, the interminable row of all the kings of France, from Pharamond down: the lazy kings, with pendent arms and downcast eyes; the valiant and combative kings, with heads and arms raised boldly heavenward.--*Paris*",
    "Then in the long, pointed windows, glass of a thousand hues; at the wide entrances to the hall, rich doors, finely sculptured; and all, the vaults, pillars, walls, jambs, panelling, doors, statues, covered from top to bottom with a splendid blue and gold illumination, which, a trifle tarnished at the epoch when we behold it, had almost entirely disappeared beneath dust and spiders in the year of grace, 1549, when du Breul still admired it from tradition.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader picture to himself now, this immense, oblong hall, illuminated by the pallid light of a January day, invaded by a motley and noisy throng which drifts along the walls, and eddies round the seven pillars, and he will have a confused idea of the whole effect of the picture, whose curious details we shall make an effort to indicate with more precision.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain, that if Ravaillac had not assassinated Henri IV., there would have been no documents in the trial of Ravaillac deposited in the clerk's office of the Palais de Justice, no accomplices interested in causing the said documents to disappear; hence, no incendiaries obliged, for lack of better means, to burn the clerk's office in order to burn the documents, and to burn the Palais de Justice in order to burn the clerk's office; consequently, in short, no conflagration in 1618.--*Paris*",
    "The old Palais would be standing still, with its ancient grand hall; I should be able to say to the reader, \"Go and look at it,\" and we should thus both escape the necessity,--I of making, and he of reading, a description of it, such as it is.--*Paris*",
    "Which demonstrates a new truth: that great events have incalculable results.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that it may be quite possible, in the first place, that Ravaillac had no accomplices; and in the second, that if he had any, they were in no way connected with the fire of 1618.--*Paris*",
    "Two other very plausible explanations exist: First, the great flaming star, a foot broad, and a cubit high, which fell from heaven, as every one knows, upon the law courts, after midnight on the seventh of March; second, Th\u00e9ophile's quatrain,----*Paris*",
    "Whatever may be thought of this triple explanation, political, physical, and poetical, of the burning of the law courts in 1618, the unfortunate fact of the fire is certain.--*Paris*",
    "Very little to-day remains, thanks to this catastrophe,--thanks, above all, to the successive restorations which have completed what it spared,--very little remains of that first dwelling of the kings of France,--of that elder palace of the Louvre, already so old in the time of Philip the Handsome, that they sought there for the traces of the magnificent buildings erected by King Robert and described by Helgaldus.--*Paris*",
    "Nearly everything has disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "What has become of the chamber of the chancellery, where Saint Louis consummated his marriage?--*Paris*",
    "the garden where he administered justice, \"clad in a coat of camelot, a surcoat of linsey-woolsey, without sleeves, and a sur-mantle of black sandal, as he lay upon the carpet with Joinville?\"--*Paris*",
    "Where is the chamber of the Emperor Sigismond?--*Paris*",
    "and that of Charles IV.?--*Paris*",
    "that of Jean the Landless?--*Paris*",
    "Where is the staircase, from which Charles VI.--*Paris*",
    "promulgated his edict of pardon?--*Paris*",
    "the slab where Marcel cut the throats of Robert de Clermont and the Marshal of Champagne, in the presence of the dauphin?--*Paris*",
    "the wicket where the bulls of Pope Benedict were torn, and whence those who had brought them departed decked out, in derision, in copes and mitres, and making an apology through all Paris?--*Paris*",
    "and the grand hall, with its gilding, its azure, its statues, its pointed arches, its pillars, its immense vault, all fretted with carvings?--*Paris*",
    "and the gilded chamber?--*Paris*",
    "and the stone lion, which stood at the door, with lowered head and tail between his legs, like the lions on the throne of Solomon, in the humiliated attitude which befits force in the presence of justice?--*Paris*",
    "and the beautiful doors?--*Paris*",
    "and the stained glass?--*Paris*",
    "and the chased ironwork, which drove Biscornette to despair?--*Paris*",
    "and the delicate woodwork of Hancy?--*Paris*",
    "What has time, what have men done with these marvels?--*Paris*",
    "What have they given us in return for all this Gallic history, for all this Gothic art?--*Paris*",
    "The heavy flattened arches of M. de Brosse, that awkward architect of the Saint-Gervais portal.--*Paris*",
    "So much for art; and, as for history, we have the gossiping reminiscences of the great pillar, still ringing with the tattle of the Patru.--*Paris*",
    "It is not much.--*Paris*",
    "Let us return to the veritable grand hall of the veritable old palace.--*Paris*",
    "The two extremities of this gigantic parallelogram were occupied, the one by the famous marble table, so long, so broad, and so thick that, as the ancient land rolls--in a style that would have given Gargantua an appetite--say, \"such a slice of marble as was never beheld in the world\"; the other by the chapel where Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "had himself sculptured on his knees before the Virgin, and whither he caused to be brought, without heeding the two gaps thus made in the row of royal statues, the statues of Charlemagne and of Saint Louis, two saints whom he supposed to be great in favor in heaven, as kings of France.--*Paris*",
    "This chapel, quite new, having been built only six years, was entirely in that charming taste of delicate architecture, of marvellous sculpture, of fine and deep chasing, which marks with us the end of the Gothic era, and which is perpetuated to about the middle of the sixteenth century in the fairylike fancies of the Renaissance.--*Paris*",
    "The little open-work rose window, pierced above the portal, was, in particular, a masterpiece of lightness and grace; one would have pronounced it a star of lace.--*Paris*",
    "In the middle of the hall, opposite the great door, a platform of gold brocade, placed against the wall, a special entrance to which had been effected through a window in the corridor of the gold chamber, had been erected for the Flemish emissaries and the other great personages invited to the presentation of the mystery play.--*Paris*",
    "It was upon the marble table that the mystery was to be enacted, as usual.--*Paris*",
    "It had been arranged for the purpose, early in the morning; its rich slabs of marble, all scratched by the heels of law clerks, supported a cage of carpenter's work of considerable height, the upper surface of which, within view of the whole hall, was to serve as the theatre, and whose interior, masked by tapestries, was to take the place of dressing-rooms for the personages of the piece.--*Paris*",
    "A ladder, naively placed on the outside, was to serve as means of communication between the dressing-room and the stage, and lend its rude rungs to entrances as well as to exits.--*Paris*",
    "There was no personage, however unexpected, no sudden change, no theatrical effect, which was not obliged to mount that ladder.--*Paris*",
    "Innocent and venerable infancy of art and contrivances!--*Paris*",
    "Four of the bailiff of the palace's sergeants, perfunctory guardians of all the pleasures of the people, on days of festival as well as on days of execution, stood at the four corners of the marble table.--*Paris*",
    "The piece was only to begin with the twelfth stroke of the great palace clock sounding midday.--*Paris*",
    "It was very late, no doubt, for a theatrical representation, but they had been obliged to fix the hour to suit the convenience of the ambassadors.--*Paris*",
    "Now, this whole multitude had been waiting since morning.--*Paris*",
    "A goodly number of curious, good people had been shivering since daybreak before the grand staircase of the palace; some even affirmed that they had passed the night across the threshold of the great door, in order to make sure that they should be the first to pass in.--*Paris*",
    "The crowd grew more dense every moment, and, like water, which rises above its normal level, began to mount along the walls, to swell around the pillars, to spread out on the entablatures, on the cornices, on the window-sills, on all the salient points of the architecture, on all the reliefs of the sculpture.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, discomfort, impatience, weariness, the liberty of a day of cynicism and folly, the quarrels which break forth for all sorts of causes--a pointed elbow, an iron-shod shoe, the fatigue of long waiting--had already, long before the hour appointed for the arrival of the ambassadors, imparted a harsh and bitter accent to the clamor of these people who were shut in, fitted into each other, pressed, trampled upon, stifled.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing was to be heard but imprecations on the Flemish, the provost of the merchants, the Cardinal de Bourbon, the bailiff of the courts, Madame Marguerite of Austria, the sergeants with their rods, the cold, the heat, the bad weather, the Bishop of Paris, the Pope of the Fools, the pillars, the statues, that closed door, that open window; all to the vast amusement of a band of scholars and lackeys scattered through the mass, who mingled with all this discontent their teasing remarks, and their malicious suggestions, and pricked the general bad temper with a pin, so to speak.--*Paris*",
    "Among the rest there was a group of those merry imps, who, after smashing the glass in a window, had seated themselves hardily on the entablature, and from that point despatched their gaze and their railleries both within and without, upon the throng in the hall, and the throng upon the Place.--*Paris*",
    "It was easy to see, from their parodied gestures, their ringing laughter, the bantering appeals which they exchanged with their comrades, from one end of the hall to the other, that these young clerks did not share the weariness and fatigue of the rest of the spectators, and that they understood very well the art of extracting, for their own private diversion from that which they had under their eyes, a spectacle which made them await the other with patience.--*Paris*",
    "A shout of laughter from all the students greeted the unlucky name of the poor furrier of the king's robes.--*Paris*",
    "The gayety redoubled.--*Paris*",
    "The big furrier, without uttering a word in reply, tried to escape all the eyes riveted upon him from all sides; but he perspired and panted in vain; like a wedge entering the wood, his efforts served only to bury still more deeply in the shoulders of his neighbors, his large, apoplectic face, purple with spite and rage.--*Paris*",
    "At length one of these, as fat, short, and venerable as himself, came to his rescue.--*Paris*",
    "The whole band burst into laughter.--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 2 Pierre Gringoire--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and when he reached that untoward conclusion: \"As soon as his illustrious eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,\" his voice was drowned in a thunder of hooting.--*Paris*",
    "Poor Jupiter, haggard, frightened, pale beneath his rouge, dropped his thunderbolt, took his cap in his hand; then he bowed and trembled and stammered: \"His eminence--the ambassadors--Madame Marguerite of Flanders--.\"--*Paris*",
    "He did not know what to say.--*Paris*",
    "In truth, he was afraid of being hung.--*Paris*",
    "Hung by the populace for waiting, hung by the cardinal for not having waited, he saw between the two dilemmas only an abyss; that is to say, a gallows.--*Paris*",
    "Luckily, some one came to rescue him from his embarrassment, and assume the responsibility.--*Paris*",
    "An individual who was standing beyond the railing, in the free space around the marble table, and whom no one had yet caught sight of, since his long, thin body was completely sheltered from every visual ray by the diameter of the pillar against which he was leaning; this individual, we say, tall, gaunt, pallid, blond, still young, although already wrinkled about the brow and cheeks, with brilliant eyes and a smiling mouth, clad in garments of black serge, worn and shining with age, approached the marble table, and made a sign to the poor sufferer.--*Paris*",
    "But the other was so confused that he did not see him.--*Paris*",
    "The new comer advanced another step.--*Paris*",
    "The other did not hear.--*Paris*",
    "At last, the tall blond, driven out of patience, shrieked almost in his face,----*Paris*",
    "Jupiter breathed once more.--*Paris*",
    "The hand clapping was deafening, and Jupiter had already withdrawn under his tapestry, while the hall still trembled with acclamations.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, the personage who had so magically turned the tempest into dead calm, as our old and dear Corneille puts it, had modestly retreated to the half-shadow of his pillar, and would, no doubt, have remained invisible there, motionless, and mute as before, had he not been plucked by the sleeve by two young women, who, standing in the front row of the spectators, had noticed his colloquy with Michel Giborne-Jupiter.--*Paris*",
    "The stranger approached the railing.--*Paris*",
    "The two young girls dropped their eyes.--*Paris*",
    "The man, who asked nothing better than to enter into conversation, looked at them with a smile.--*Paris*",
    "The tall, light-haired young man retreated a step; but the two curious maidens had no mind to let slip their prize.--*Paris*",
    "A brief silence ensued--broken by the stranger.--*Paris*",
    "Li\u00e9narde lowered her eyes modestly.--*Paris*",
    "Gisquette glanced at her and did the same.--*Paris*",
    "He continued, with a smile,----*Paris*",
    "The author of the \"Cid\" could not have said \"Pierre Corneille\" with more pride.--*Paris*",
    "Our readers have been able to observe, that a certain amount of time must have already elapsed from the moment when Jupiter had retired beneath the tapestry to the instant when the author of the new morality had thus abruptly revealed himself to the innocent admiration of Gisquette and Li\u00e9narde.--*Paris*",
    "Remarkable fact: that whole crowd, so tumultuous but a few moments before, now waited amiably on the word of the comedian; which proves the eternal truth, still experienced every day in our theatres, that the best means of making the public wait patiently is to assure them that one is about to begin instantly.--*Paris*",
    "However, scholar Johannes had not fallen asleep.--*Paris*",
    "This was all that was needed.--*Paris*",
    "The music of high and low instruments immediately became audible from the interior of the stage; the tapestry was raised; four personages, in motley attire and painted faces, emerged from it, climbed the steep ladder of the theatre, and, arrived upon the upper platform, arranged themselves in a line before the public, whom they saluted with profound reverences; then the symphony ceased.--*Paris*",
    "The mystery was about to begin.--*Paris*",
    "The four personages, after having reaped a rich reward of applause for their reverences, began, in the midst of profound silence, a prologue, which we gladly spare the reader.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, as happens in our own day, the public was more occupied with the costumes that the actors wore than with the roles that they were enacting; and, in truth, they were right.--*Paris*",
    "All four were dressed in parti-colored robes of yellow and white, which were distinguished from each other only by the nature of the stuff; the first was of gold and silver brocade; the second, of silk; the third, of wool; the fourth, of linen.--*Paris*",
    "The first of these personages carried in his right hand a sword; the second, two golden keys; the third, a pair of scales; the fourth, a spade: and, in order to aid sluggish minds which would not have seen clearly through the transparency of these attributes, there was to be read, in large, black letters, on the hem of the robe of brocade, MY NAME IS NOBILITY; on the hem of the silken robe, MY NAME IS CLERGY; on the hem of the woolen robe, MY NAME IS MERCHANDISE; on the hem of the linen robe, MY NAME IS LABOR.--*Paris*",
    "The sex of the two male characters was briefly indicated to every judicious spectator, by their shorter robes, and by the cap which they wore on their heads; while the two female characters, less briefly clad, were covered with hoods.--*Paris*",
    "Much ill-will would also have been required, not to comprehend, through the medium of the poetry of the prologue, that Labor was wedded to Merchandise, and Clergy to Nobility, and that the two happy couples possessed in common a magnificent golden dolphin, which they desired to adjudge to the fairest only.--*Paris*",
    "So they were roaming about the world seeking and searching for this beauty, and, after having successively rejected the Queen of Golconda, the Princess of Trebizonde, the daughter of the Grand Khan of Tartary, etc., Labor and Clergy, Nobility and Merchandise, had come to rest upon the marble table of the Palais de Justice, and to utter, in the presence of the honest audience, as many sentences and maxims as could then be dispensed at the Faculty of Arts, at examinations, sophisms, determinances, figures, and acts, where the masters took their degrees.--*Paris*",
    "All this was, in fact, very fine.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, in that throng, upon which the four allegories vied with each other in pouring out floods of metaphors, there was no ear more attentive, no heart that palpitated more, not an eye was more haggard, no neck more outstretched, than the eye, the ear, the neck, and the heart of the author, of the poet, of that brave Pierre Gringoire, who had not been able to resist, a moment before, the joy of telling his name to two pretty girls.--*Paris*",
    "He had retreated a few paces from them, behind his pillar, and there he listened, looked, enjoyed.--*Paris*",
    "The amiable applause which had greeted the beginning of his prologue was still echoing in his bosom, and he was completely absorbed in that species of ecstatic contemplation with which an author beholds his ideas fall, one by one, from the mouth of the actor into the vast silence of the audience.--*Paris*",
    "Worthy Pierre Gringoire!--*Paris*",
    "It pains us to say it, but this first ecstasy was speedily disturbed.--*Paris*",
    "Hardly had Gringoire raised this intoxicating cup of joy and triumph to his lips, when a drop of bitterness was mingled with it.--*Paris*",
    "A tattered mendicant, who could not collect any coins, lost as he was in the midst of the crowd, and who had not probably found sufficient indemnity in the pockets of his neighbors, had hit upon the idea of perching himself upon some conspicuous point, in order to attract looks and alms.--*Paris*",
    "He had, accordingly, hoisted himself, during the first verses of the prologue, with the aid of the pillars of the reserve gallery, to the cornice which ran round the balustrade at its lower edge; and there he had seated himself, soliciting the attention and the pity of the multitude, with his rags and a hideous sore which covered his right arm.--*Paris*",
    "However, he uttered not a word.--*Paris*",
    "The silence which he preserved allowed the prologue to proceed without hindrance, and no perceptible disorder would have ensued, if ill-luck had not willed that the scholar Joannes should catch sight, from the heights of his pillar, of the mendicant and his grimaces.--*Paris*",
    "A wild fit of laughter took possession of the young scamp, who, without caring that he was interrupting the spectacle, and disturbing the universal composure, shouted boldly,----*Paris*",
    "Any one who has thrown a stone into a frog pond, or fired a shot into a covey of birds, can form an idea of the effect produced by these incongruous words, in the midst of the general attention.--*Paris*",
    "It made Gringoire shudder as though it had been an electric shock.--*Paris*",
    "The prologue stopped short, and all heads turned tumultuously towards the beggar, who, far from being disconcerted by this, saw, in this incident, a good opportunity for reaping his harvest, and who began to whine in a doleful way, half closing his eyes the while,--\"Charity, please!\"--*Paris*",
    "This episode considerably distracted the attention of the audience; and a goodly number of spectators, among them Robin Poussepain, and all the clerks at their head, gayly applauded this eccentric duet, which the scholar, with his shrill voice, and the mendicant had just improvised in the middle of the prologue.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was highly displeased.--*Paris*",
    "On recovering from his first stupefaction, he bestirred himself to shout, to the four personages on the stage, \"Go on!--*Paris*",
    "What the devil!--go on!\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, he felt some one pluck at the hem of his surtout; he turned round, and not without ill-humor, and found considerable difficulty in smiling; but he was obliged to do so, nevertheless.--*Paris*",
    "It was the pretty arm of Gisquette la Gencienne, which, passed through the railing, was soliciting his attention in this manner.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire started, like a man whose wound has been probed to the quick.--*Paris*",
    "From that moment forth, Gisquette was nothing to him.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, the actors had obeyed his injunction, and the public, seeing that they were beginning to speak again, began once more to listen, not without having lost many beauties in the sort of soldered joint which was formed between the two portions of the piece thus abruptly cut short.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire commented on it bitterly to himself.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, tranquillity was gradually restored, the scholar held his peace, the mendicant counted over some coins in his hat, and the piece resumed the upper hand.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, a very fine work, and one which, as it seems to us, might be put to use to-day, by the aid of a little rearrangement.--*Paris*",
    "The exposition, rather long and rather empty, that is to say, according to the rules, was simple; and Gringoire, in the candid sanctuary of his own conscience, admired its clearness.--*Paris*",
    "As the reader may surmise, the four allegorical personages were somewhat weary with having traversed the three sections of the world, without having found suitable opportunity for getting rid of their golden dolphin.--*Paris*",
    "Thereupon a eulogy of the marvellous fish, with a thousand delicate allusions to the young betrothed of Marguerite of Flanders, then sadly cloistered in at Amboise, and without a suspicion that Labor and Clergy, Nobility and Merchandise had just made the circuit of the world in his behalf.--*Paris*",
    "The said dauphin was then young, was handsome, was stout, and, above all (magnificent origin of all royal virtues), he was the son of the Lion of France.--*Paris*",
    "I declare that this bold metaphor is admirable, and that the natural history of the theatre, on a day of allegory and royal marriage songs, is not in the least startled by a dolphin who is the son of a lion.--*Paris*",
    "It is precisely these rare and Pindaric mixtures which prove the poet's enthusiasm.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, in order to play the part of critic also, the poet might have developed this beautiful idea in something less than two hundred lines.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that the mystery was to last from noon until four o'clock, in accordance with the orders of monsieur the provost, and that it was necessary to say something.--*Paris*",
    "Besides, the people listened patiently.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, in the very middle of a quarrel between Mademoiselle Merchandise and Madame Nobility, at the moment when Monsieur Labor was giving utterance to this wonderful line,----*Paris*",
    "In forest ne'er was seen a more triumphant beast;--*Paris*",
    "the door of the reserved gallery which had hitherto remained so inopportunely closed, opened still more inopportunely; and the ringing voice of the usher announced abruptly, \"His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.\"--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 3 Monsieur The Cardinal--*Paris*",
    "Poor Gringoire!--*Paris*",
    "the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, \"His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.\"--*Paris*",
    "It is not that Pierre Gringoire either feared or disdained monsieur the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "He had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that.--*Paris*",
    "A true eclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, Gringoire was one of those firm and lofty, moderate and calm spirits, which always know how to bear themselves amid all circumstances (~stare in dimidio rerum~), and who are full of reason and of liberal philosophy, while still setting store by cardinals.--*Paris*",
    "A rare, precious, and never interrupted race of philosophers to whom wisdom, like another Ariadne, seems to have given a clew of thread which they have been walking along unwinding since the beginning of the world, through the labyrinth of human affairs.--*Paris*",
    "One finds them in all ages, ever the same; that is to say, always according to all times.--*Paris*",
    "And, without reckoning our Pierre Gringoire, who may represent them in the fifteenth century if we succeed in bestowing upon him the distinction which he deserves, it certainly was their spirit which animated Father du Breul, when he wrote, in the sixteenth, these naively sublime words, worthy of all centuries: \"I am a Parisian by nation, and a Parrhisian in language, for ~parrhisia~ in Greek signifies liberty of speech; of which I have made use even towards messeigneurs the cardinals, uncle and brother to Monsieur the Prince de Conty, always with respect to their greatness, and without offending any one of their suite, which is much to say.\"--*Paris*",
    "There was then neither hatred for the cardinal, nor disdain for his presence, in the disagreeable impression produced upon Pierre Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "Quite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare a coat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous allusions in his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the dauphin, son of the Lion of France, fall upon the most eminent ear.--*Paris*",
    "But it is not interest which predominates in the noble nature of poets.--*Paris*",
    "I suppose that the entity of the poet may be represented by the number ten; it is certain that a chemist on analyzing and pharmacopolizing it, as Rabelais says, would find it composed of one part interest to nine parts of self-esteem.--*Paris*",
    "Now, at the moment when the door had opened to admit the cardinal, the nine parts of self-esteem in Gringoire, swollen and expanded by the breath of popular admiration, were in a state of prodigious augmentation, beneath which disappeared, as though stifled, that imperceptible molecule of which we have just remarked upon in the constitution of poets; a precious ingredient, by the way, a ballast of reality and humanity, without which they would not touch the earth.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire enjoyed seeing, feeling, fingering, so to speak an entire assembly (of knaves, it is true, but what matters that ?)--*Paris*",
    "stupefied, petrified, and as though asphyxiated in the presence of the incommensurable tirades which welled up every instant from all parts of his bridal song.--*Paris*",
    "I affirm that he shared the general beatitude, and that, quite the reverse of La Fontaine, who, at the presentation of his comedy of the \"Florentine,\" asked, \"Who is the ill-bred lout who made that rhapsody?\"--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire would gladly have inquired of his neighbor, \"Whose masterpiece is this?\"--*Paris*",
    "The reader can now judge of the effect produced upon him by the abrupt and unseasonable arrival of the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "That which he had to fear was only too fully realized.--*Paris*",
    "The entrance of his eminence upset the audience.--*Paris*",
    "All heads turned towards the gallery.--*Paris*",
    "It was no longer possible to hear one's self.--*Paris*",
    "The cardinal halted for a moment on the threshold of the estrade.--*Paris*",
    "While he was sending a rather indifferent glance around the audience, the tumult redoubled.--*Paris*",
    "Each person wished to get a better view of him.--*Paris*",
    "Each man vied with the other in thrusting his head over his neighbor's shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "He was, in fact, an exalted personage, the sight of whom was well worth any other comedy.--*Paris*",
    "Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon, Archbishop and Comte of Lyon, Primate of the Gauls, was allied both to Louis XI., through his brother, Pierre, Seigneur de Beaujeu, who had married the king's eldest daughter, and to Charles the Bold through his mother, Agnes of Burgundy.--*Paris*",
    "Now, the dominating trait, the peculiar and distinctive trait of the character of the Primate of the Gauls, was the spirit of the courtier, and devotion to the powers that be.--*Paris*",
    "The reader can form an idea of the numberless embarrassments which this double relationship had caused him, and of all the temporal reefs among which his spiritual bark had been forced to tack, in order not to suffer shipwreck on either Louis or Charles, that Scylla and that Charybdis which had devoured the Duc de Nemours and the Constable de Saint-Pol.--*Paris*",
    "Thanks to Heaven's mercy, he had made the voyage successfully, and had reached home without hindrance.--*Paris*",
    "But although he was in port, and precisely because he was in port, he never recalled without disquiet the varied haps of his political career, so long uneasy and laborious.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, he was in the habit of saying that the year 1476 had been \"white and black\" for him--meaning thereby, that in the course of that year he had lost his mother, the Duchesse de la Bourbonnais, and his cousin, the Duke of Burgundy, and that one grief had consoled him for the other.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he was a fine man; he led a joyous cardinal's life, liked to enliven himself with the royal vintage of Challuau, did not hate Richarde la Garmoise and Thomasse la Saillarde, bestowed alms on pretty girls rather than on old women,--and for all these reasons was very agreeable to the populace of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "He never went about otherwise than surrounded by a small court of bishops and abb\u00e9s of high lineage, gallant, jovial, and given to carousing on occasion; and more than once the good and devout women of Saint Germain d' Auxerre, when passing at night beneath the brightly illuminated windows of Bourbon, had been scandalized to hear the same voices which had intoned vespers for them during the day carolling, to the clinking of glasses, the bacchic proverb of Benedict XII., that pope who had added a third crown to the Tiara--~Bibamus papaliter~.--*Paris*",
    "It was this justly acquired popularity, no doubt, which preserved him on his entrance from any bad reception at the hands of the mob, which had been so displeased but a moment before, and very little disposed to respect a cardinal on the very day when it was to elect a pope.--*Paris*",
    "But the Parisians cherish little rancor; and then, having forced the beginning of the play by their authority, the good bourgeois had got the upper hand of the cardinal, and this triumph was sufficient for them.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, the Cardinal de Bourbon was a handsome man,--he wore a fine scarlet robe, which he carried off very well,--that is to say, he had all the women on his side, and, consequently, the best half of the audience.--*Paris*",
    "Assuredly, it would be injustice and bad taste to hoot a cardinal for having come late to the spectacle, when he is a handsome man, and when he wears his scarlet robe well.--*Paris*",
    "He entered, then, bowed to those present with the hereditary smile of the great for the people, and directed his course slowly towards his scarlet velvet arm-chair, with the air of thinking of something quite different.--*Paris*",
    "His cortege--what we should nowadays call his staff--of bishops and abb\u00e9s invaded the estrade in his train, not without causing redoubled tumult and curiosity among the audience.--*Paris*",
    "Each man vied with his neighbor in pointing them out and naming them, in seeing who should recognize at least one of them: this one, the Bishop of Marseilles (Alaudet, if my memory serves me right);--this one, the primicier of Saint-Denis;--this one, Robert de Lespinasse, Abb\u00e9 of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s, that libertine brother of a mistress of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "All these details which we here lay bare for the edification of the reader, were so covered by the general uproar, that they were lost in it before reaching the reserved platforms; moreover, they would have moved the cardinal but little, so much a part of the customs were the liberties of that day.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he had another cause for solicitude, and his mien as wholly preoccupied with it, which entered the estrade the same time as himself; this was the embassy from Flanders.--*Paris*",
    "Not that he was a profound politician, nor was he borrowing trouble about the possible consequences of the marriage of his cousin Marguerite de Bourgoyne to his cousin Charles, Dauphin de Vienne; nor as to how long the good understanding which had been patched up between the Duke of Austria and the King of France would last; nor how the King of England would take this disdain of his daughter.--*Paris*",
    "All that troubled him but little; and he gave a warm reception every evening to the wine of the royal vintage of Chaillot, without a suspicion that several flasks of that same wine (somewhat revised and corrected, it is true, by Doctor Coictier), cordially offered to Edward IV.--*Paris*",
    "by Louis XI., would, some fine morning, rid Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "of Edward IV.--*Paris*",
    "So he turned toward the door, and with the best grace in the world (so well had he trained himself to it), when the usher announced, in a sonorous voice, \"Messieurs the Envoys of Monsieur the Duke of Austria.\"--*Paris*",
    "It is useless to add that the whole hall did the same.--*Paris*",
    "Then arrived, two by two, with a gravity which made a contrast in the midst of the frisky ecclesiastical escort of Charles de Bourbon, the eight and forty ambassadors of Maximilian of Austria, having at their head the reverend Father in God, Jehan, Abbot of Saint-Bertin, Chancellor of the Golden Fleece, and Jacques de Goy, Sieur Dauby, Grand Bailiff of Ghent.--*Paris*",
    "A deep silence settled over the assembly, accompanied by stifled laughter at the preposterous names and all the bourgeois designations which each of these personages transmitted with imperturbable gravity to the usher, who then tossed names and titles pell-mell and mutilated to the crowd below.--*Paris*",
    "There were Master Loys Roelof, alderman of the city of Louvain; Messire Clays d'Etuelde, alderman of Brussels; Messire Paul de Baeust, Sieur de Voirmizelle, President of Flanders; Master Jehan Coleghens, burgomaster of the city of Antwerp; Master George de la Moere, first alderman of the kuere of the city of Ghent; Master Gheldolf van der Hage, first alderman of the ~parchous~ of the said town; and the Sieur de Bierbecque, and Jehan Pinnock, and Jehan Dymaerzelle, etc., etc., etc.--*Paris*",
    "There was one exception, however.--*Paris*",
    "It was a subtle, intelligent, crafty-looking face, a sort of combined monkey and diplomat phiz, before whom the cardinal made three steps and a profound bow, and whose name, nevertheless, was only, \"Guillaume Rym, counsellor and pensioner of the City of Ghent.\"--*Paris*",
    "Few persons were then aware who Guillaume Rym was.--*Paris*",
    "A rare genius who in a time of revolution would have made a brilliant appearance on the surface of events, but who in the fifteenth century was reduced to cavernous intrigues, and to \"living in mines,\" as the Duc de Saint-Simon expresses it.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he was appreciated by the \"miner\" of Europe; he plotted familiarly with Louis XI., and often lent a hand to the king's secret jobs.--*Paris*",
    "All which things were quite unknown to that throng, who were amazed at the cardinal's politeness to that frail figure of a Flemish bailiff.--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 4 Master Jacques Coppenole--*Paris*",
    "While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox.--*Paris*",
    "His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the velvet and silk which surrounded him.--*Paris*",
    "Presuming that he was some groom who had stolen in, the usher stopped him.--*Paris*",
    "The man in the leather jerkin shouldered him aside.--*Paris*",
    "The usher recoiled.--*Paris*",
    "One might bring one's self to announce aldermen and burgomasters, but a hosier was too much.--*Paris*",
    "The cardinal was on thorns.--*Paris*",
    "All the people were staring and listening.--*Paris*",
    "For two days his eminence had been exerting his utmost efforts to lick these Flemish bears into shape, and to render them a little more presentable to the public, and this freak was startling.--*Paris*",
    "But Guillaume Rym, with his polished smile, approached the usher.--*Paris*",
    "This was a mistake.--*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rym alone might have conjured away the difficulty, but Coppenole had heard the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "Laughter and applause burst forth.--*Paris*",
    "A jest is always understood in Paris, and, consequently, always applauded.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that Coppenole was of the people, and that the auditors which surrounded him were also of the people.--*Paris*",
    "Thus the communication between him and them had been prompt, electric, and, so to speak, on a level.--*Paris*",
    "The haughty air of the Flemish hosier, by humiliating the courtiers, had touched in all these plebeian souls that latent sentiment of dignity still vague and indistinct in the fifteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "This hosier was an equal, who had just held his own before monsieur the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "A very sweet reflection to poor fellows habituated to respect and obedience towards the underlings of the sergeants of the bailiff of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, the cardinal's train-bearer.--*Paris*",
    "Coppenole proudly saluted his eminence, who returned the salute of the all-powerful bourgeois feared by Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "Then, while Guillaume Rym, a \"sage and malicious man,\" as Philippe de Comines puts it, watched them both with a smile of raillery and superiority, each sought his place, the cardinal quite abashed and troubled, Coppenole tranquil and haughty, and thinking, no doubt, that his title of hosier was as good as any other, after all, and that Marie of Burgundy, mother to that Marguerite whom Coppenole was to-day bestowing in marriage, would have been less afraid of the cardinal than of the hosier; for it is not a cardinal who would have stirred up a revolt among the men of Ghent against the favorites of the daughter of Charles the Bold; it is not a cardinal who could have fortified the populace with a word against her tears and prayers, when the Maid of Flanders came to supplicate her people in their behalf, even at the very foot of the scaffold; while the hosier had only to raise his leather elbow, in order to cause to fall your two heads, most illustrious seigneurs, Guy d'Hymbercourt and Chancellor Guillaume Hugonet.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, all was over for the poor cardinal, and he was obliged to quaff to the dregs the bitter cup of being in such bad company.--*Paris*",
    "The reader has, probably, not forgotten the impudent beggar who had been clinging fast to the fringes of the cardinal's gallery ever since the beginning of the prologue.--*Paris*",
    "The arrival of the illustrious guests had by no means caused him to relax his hold, and, while the prelates and ambassadors were packing themselves into the stalls--like genuine Flemish herrings--he settled himself at his ease, and boldly crossed his legs on the architrave.--*Paris*",
    "The insolence of this proceeding was extraordinary, yet no one noticed it at first, the attention of all being directed elsewhere.--*Paris*",
    "He, on his side, perceived nothing that was going on in the hall; he wagged his head with the unconcern of a Neapolitan, repeating from time to time, amid the clamor, as from a mechanical habit, \"Charity, please!\"--*Paris*",
    "And, assuredly, he was, out of all those present, the only one who had not deigned to turn his head at the altercation between Coppenole and the usher.--*Paris*",
    "Now, chance ordained that the master hosier of Ghent, with whom the people were already in lively sympathy, and upon whom all eyes were riveted--should come and seat himself in the front row of the gallery, directly above the mendicant; and people were not a little amazed to see the Flemish ambassador, on concluding his inspection of the knave thus placed beneath his eyes, bestow a friendly tap on that ragged shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "The beggar turned round; there was surprise, recognition, a lighting up of the two countenances, and so forth; then, without paying the slightest heed in the world to the spectators, the hosier and the wretched being began to converse in a low tone, holding each other's hands, in the meantime, while the rags of Clopin Trouillefou, spread out upon the cloth of gold of the dais, produced the effect of a caterpillar on an orange.--*Paris*",
    "The novelty of this singular scene excited such a murmur of mirth and gayety in the hall, that the cardinal was not slow to perceive it; he half bent forward, and, as from the point where he was placed he could catch only an imperfect view of Trouillerfou's ignominious doublet, he very naturally imagined that the mendicant was asking alms, and, disgusted with his audacity, he exclaimed: \"Bailiff of the Courts, toss me that knave into the river!\"--*Paris*",
    "The whole little court in cassocks went into ecstacies over this play upon words.--*Paris*",
    "The cardinal felt a little relieved; he was quits with Coppenole, he also had had his jest applauded.--*Paris*",
    "Now, will those of our readers who possess the power of generalizing an image or an idea, as the expression runs in the style of to-day, permit us to ask them if they have formed a very clear conception of the spectacle presented at this moment, upon which we have arrested their attention, by the vast parallelogram of the grand hall of the palace.--*Paris*",
    "In the middle of the hall, backed against the western wall, a large and magnificent gallery draped with cloth of gold, into which enter in procession, through a small, arched door, grave personages, announced successively by the shrill voice of an usher.--*Paris*",
    "On the front benches were already a number of venerable figures, muffled in ermine, velvet, and scarlet.--*Paris*",
    "Around the dais--which remains silent and dignified--below, opposite, everywhere, a great crowd and a great murmur.--*Paris*",
    "Thousands of glances directed by the people on each face upon the dais, a thousand whispers over each name.--*Paris*",
    "Certainly, the spectacle is curious, and well deserves the attention of the spectators.--*Paris*",
    "But yonder, quite at the end, what is that sort of trestle work with four motley puppets upon it, and more below?--*Paris*",
    "Who is that man beside the trestle, with a black doublet and a pale face?--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "my dear reader, it is Pierre Gringoire and his prologue.--*Paris*",
    "We have all forgotten him completely.--*Paris*",
    "This is precisely what he feared.--*Paris*",
    "From the moment of the cardinal's entrance, Gringoire had never ceased to tremble for the safety of his prologue.--*Paris*",
    "At first he had enjoined the actors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue, and to raise their voices; then, perceiving that no one was listening, he had stopped them; and, during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted, he had not ceased to stamp, to flounce about, to appeal to Gisquette and Li\u00e9narde, and to urge his neighbors to the continuance of the prologue; all in vain.--*Paris*",
    "No one quitted the cardinal, the embassy, and the gallery--sole centre of this vast circle of visual rays.--*Paris*",
    "We must also believe, and we say it with regret, that the prologue had begun slightly to weary the audience at the moment when his eminence had arrived, and created a diversion in so terrible a fashion.--*Paris*",
    "After all, on the gallery as well as on the marble table, the spectacle was the same: the conflict of Labor and Clergy, of Nobility and Merchandise.--*Paris*",
    "And many people preferred to see them alive, breathing, moving, elbowing each other in flesh and blood, in this Flemish embassy, in this Episcopal court, under the cardinal's robe, under Coppenole's jerkin, than painted, decked out, talking in verse, and, so to speak, stuffed beneath the yellow amid white tunics in which Gringoire had so ridiculously clothed them.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, when our poet beheld quiet reestablished to some extent, he devised a stratagem which might have redeemed all.--*Paris*",
    "This semi-approbation sufficed for Gringoire, and, conducting his own affairs, he began to shout, confounding himself with the crowd as much as possible: \"Begin the mystery again!--*Paris*",
    "begin again!\"--*Paris*",
    "But Gringoire had multiplied himself, and only shouted the more vigorously: \"Begin again!--*Paris*",
    "begin again!\"--*Paris*",
    "These clamors attracted the attention of the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "The bailiff of the courts was a sort of amphibious magistrate, a sort of bat of the judicial order, related to both the rat and the bird, the judge and the soldier.--*Paris*",
    "He approached his eminence, and not without a good deal of fear of the latter's displeasure, he awkwardly explained to him the seeming disrespect of the audience: that noonday had arrived before his eminence, and that the comedians had been forced to begin without waiting for his eminence.--*Paris*",
    "The cardinal burst into a laugh.--*Paris*",
    "The bailiff advanced to the edge of the estrade, and cried, after having invoked silence by a wave of the hand,----*Paris*",
    "Both parties were forced to resign themselves.--*Paris*",
    "But the public and the author long cherished a grudge against the cardinal.--*Paris*",
    "So the personages on the stage took up their parts, and Gringoire hoped that the rest of his work, at least, would be listened to.--*Paris*",
    "This hope was speedily dispelled like his other illusions; silence had indeed, been restored in the audience, after a fashion; but Gringoire had not observed that at the moment when the cardinal gave the order to continue, the gallery was far from full, and that after the Flemish envoys there had arrived new personages forming part of the cortege, whose names and ranks, shouted out in the midst of his dialogue by the intermittent cry of the usher, produced considerable ravages in it.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader imagine the effect in the midst of a theatrical piece, of the yelping of an usher, flinging in between two rhymes, and often in the middle of a line, parentheses like the following,----*Paris*",
    "This was becoming unbearable.--*Paris*",
    "This strange accompaniment, which rendered it difficult to follow the piece, made Gringoire all the more indignant because he could not conceal from himself the fact that the interest was continually increasing, and that all his work required was a chance of being heard.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, difficult to imagine a more ingenious and more dramatic composition.--*Paris*",
    "The four personages of the prologue were bewailing themselves in their mortal embarrassment, when Venus in person, (~vera incessa patuit dea~) presented herself to them, clad in a fine robe bearing the heraldic device of the ship of the city of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "She had come herself to claim the dolphin promised to the most beautiful.--*Paris*",
    "Jupiter, whose thunder could be heard rumbling in the dressing-room, supported her claim, and Venus was on the point of carrying it off,--that is to say, without allegory, of marrying monsieur the dauphin, when a young child clad in white damask, and holding in her hand a daisy (a transparent personification of Mademoiselle Marguerite of Flanders) came to contest it with Venus.--*Paris*",
    "Theatrical effect and change.--*Paris*",
    "After a dispute, Venus, Marguerite, and the assistants agreed to submit to the good judgment of time holy Virgin.--*Paris*",
    "There was another good part, that of the king of Mesopotamia; but through so many interruptions, it was difficult to make out what end he served.--*Paris*",
    "All these persons had ascended by the ladder to the stage.--*Paris*",
    "But all was over; none of these beauties had been felt nor understood.--*Paris*",
    "On the entrance of the cardinal, one would have said that an invisible magic thread had suddenly drawn all glances from the marble table to the gallery, from the southern to the western extremity of the hall.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing could disenchant the audience; all eyes remained fixed there, and the new-comers and their accursed names, and their faces, and their costumes, afforded a continual diversion.--*Paris*",
    "This was very distressing.--*Paris*",
    "With the exception of Gisquette and Li\u00e9narde, who turned round from time to time when Gringoire plucked them by the sleeve; with the exception of the big, patient neighbor, no one listened, no one looked at the poor, deserted morality full face.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire saw only profiles.--*Paris*",
    "With what bitterness did he behold his whole erection of glory and of poetry crumble away bit by bit!--*Paris*",
    "And to think that these people had been upon the point of instituting a revolt against the bailiff through impatience to hear his work!--*Paris*",
    "now that they had it they did not care for it.--*Paris*",
    "This same representation which had been begun amid so unanimous an acclamation!--*Paris*",
    "Eternal flood and ebb of popular favor!--*Paris*",
    "To think that they had been on the point of hanging the bailiff's sergeant!--*Paris*",
    "What would he not have given to be still at that hour of honey!--*Paris*",
    "But the usher's brutal monologue came to an end; every one had arrived, and Gringoire breathed freely once more; the actors continued bravely.--*Paris*",
    "But Master Coppenole, the hosier, must needs rise of a sudden, and Gringoire was forced to listen to him deliver, amid universal attention, the following abominable harangue.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire would have liked to retort; stupefaction, rage, indignation, deprived him of words.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, the suggestion of the popular hosier was received with such enthusiasm by these bourgeois who were flattered at being called \"squires,\" that all resistance was useless.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing to be done but to allow one's self to drift with the torrent.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire hid his face between his two hands, not being so fortunate as to have a mantle with which to veil his head, like Agamemnon of Timantis.--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 5 Quasimodo--*Paris*",
    "In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole's idea.--*Paris*",
    "Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work.--*Paris*",
    "The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match.--*Paris*",
    "A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads.--*Paris*",
    "In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.--*Paris*",
    "It was settled that each candidate, man or woman (for it was possible to choose a female pope), should, for the sake of leaving the impression of his grimace fresh and complete, cover his face and remain concealed in the chapel until the moment of his appearance.--*Paris*",
    "In less than an instant, the chapel was crowded with competitors, upon whom the door was then closed.--*Paris*",
    "Coppenole, from his post, ordered all, directed all, arranged all.--*Paris*",
    "During the uproar, the cardinal, no less abashed than Gringoire, had retired with all his suite, under the pretext of business and vespers, without the crowd which his arrival had so deeply stirred being in the least moved by his departure.--*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rym was the only one who noticed his eminence's discomfiture.--*Paris*",
    "The attention of the populace, like the sun, pursued its revolution; having set out from one end of the hall, and halted for a space in the middle, it had now reached the other end.--*Paris*",
    "The marble table, the brocaded gallery had each had their day; it was now the turn of the chapel of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "Henceforth, the field was open to all folly.--*Paris*",
    "There was no one there now, but the Flemings and the rabble.--*Paris*",
    "The grimaces began.--*Paris*",
    "The first face which appeared at the aperture, with eyelids turned up to the reds, a mouth open like a maw, and a brow wrinkled like our hussar boots of the Empire, evoked such an inextinguishable peal of laughter that Homer would have taken all these louts for gods.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, the grand hall was anything but Olympus, and Gringoire's poor Jupiter knew it better than any one else.--*Paris*",
    "A second and third grimace followed, then another and another; and the laughter and transports of delight went on increasing.--*Paris*",
    "There was in this spectacle, a peculiar power of intoxication and fascination, of which it would be difficult to convey to the reader of our day and our salons any idea.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader picture to himself a series of visages presenting successively all geometrical forms, from the triangle to the trapezium, from the cone to the polyhedron; all human expressions, from wrath to lewdness; all ages, from the wrinkles of the new-born babe to the wrinkles of the aged and dying; all religious phantasmagories, from Faun to Beelzebub; all animal profiles, from the maw to the beak, from the jowl to the muzzle.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader imagine all these grotesque figures of the Pont Neuf, those nightmares petrified beneath the hand of Germain Pilon, assuming life and breath, and coming in turn to stare you in the face with burning eyes; all the masks of the Carnival of Venice passing in succession before your glass,--in a word, a human kaleidoscope.--*Paris*",
    "The orgy grew more and more Flemish.--*Paris*",
    "Teniers could have given but a very imperfect idea of it.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader picture to himself in bacchanal form, Salvator Rosa's battle.--*Paris*",
    "There were no longer either scholars or ambassadors or bourgeois or men or women; there was no longer any Clopin Trouillefou, nor Gilles Lecornu, nor Marie Quatrelivres, nor Robin Poussepain.--*Paris*",
    "All was universal license.--*Paris*",
    "The grand hall was no longer anything but a vast furnace of effrontry and joviality, where every mouth was a cry, every individual a posture; everything shouted and howled.--*Paris*",
    "The strange visages which came, in turn, to gnash their teeth in the rose window, were like so many brands cast into the brazier; and from the whole of this effervescing crowd, there escaped, as from a furnace, a sharp, piercing, stinging noise, hissing like the wings of a gnat.--*Paris*",
    "But we must do justice to our friend Jehan.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of this witches' sabbath, he was still to be seen on the top of his pillar, like the cabin-boy on the topmast.--*Paris*",
    "He floundered about with incredible fury.--*Paris*",
    "His mouth was wide open, and from it there escaped a cry which no one heard, not that it was covered by the general clamor, great as that was but because it attained, no doubt, the limit of perceptible sharp sounds, the thousand vibrations of Sauveur, or the eight thousand of Biot.--*Paris*",
    "As for Gringoire, the first moment of depression having passed, he had regained his composure.--*Paris*",
    "He had hardened himself against adversity.---\"Continue!\"--*Paris*",
    "he had said for the third time, to his comedians, speaking machines; then as he was marching with great strides in front of the marble table, a fancy seized him to go and appear in his turn at the aperture of the chapel, were it only for the pleasure of making a grimace at that ungrateful populace.--\"But no, that would not be worthy of us; no, vengeance!--*Paris*",
    "let us combat until the end,\" he repeated to himself; \"the power of poetry over people is great; I will bring them back.--*Paris*",
    "We shall see which will carry the day, grimaces or polite literature.\"--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "he had been left the sole spectator of his piece.--*Paris*",
    "It was far worse than it had been a little while before.--*Paris*",
    "He no longer beheld anything but backs.--*Paris*",
    "I am mistaken.--*Paris*",
    "The big, patient man, whom he had already consulted in a critical moment, had remained with his face turned towards the stage.--*Paris*",
    "As for Gisquette and Li\u00e9narde, they had deserted him long ago.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was touched to the heart by the fidelity of his only spectator.--*Paris*",
    "He approached him and addressed him, shaking his arm slightly; for the good man was leaning on the balustrade and dozing a little.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was forced to content himself with this eulogy; for a thunder of applause, mingled with a prodigious acclamation, cut their conversation short.--*Paris*",
    "The Pope of the Fools had been elected.--*Paris*",
    "The acclamation was unanimous; people rushed towards the chapel.--*Paris*",
    "They made the lucky Pope of the Fools come forth in triumph.--*Paris*",
    "But it was then that surprise and admiration attained their highest pitch; the grimace was his face.--*Paris*",
    "Or rather, his whole person was a grimace.--*Paris*",
    "A huge head, bristling with red hair; between his shoulders an enormous hump, a counterpart perceptible in front; a system of thighs and legs so strangely astray that they could touch each other only at the knees, and, viewed from the front, resembled the crescents of two scythes joined by the handles; large feet, monstrous hands; and, with all this deformity, an indescribable and redoubtable air of vigor, agility, and courage,--strange exception to the eternal rule which wills that force as well as beauty shall be the result of harmony.--*Paris*",
    "Such was the pope whom the fools had just chosen for themselves.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced him a giant who had been broken and badly put together again.--*Paris*",
    "When this species of cyclops appeared on the threshold of the chapel, motionless, squat, and almost as broad as he was tall; squared on the base, as a great man says; with his doublet half red, half violet, sown with silver bells, and, above all, in the perfection of his ugliness, the populace recognized him on the instant, and shouted with one voice,----*Paris*",
    "It will be seen that the poor fellow had a choice of surnames.--*Paris*",
    "The women did, in fact, hide their faces.--*Paris*",
    "The men, on the contrary, were delighted and applauded.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, the object of the tumult, still stood on the threshold of the chapel, sombre and grave, and allowed them to admire him.--*Paris*",
    "One scholar (Robin Poussepain, I think), came and laughed in his face, and too close.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo contented himself with taking him by the girdle, and hurling him ten paces off amid the crowd; all without uttering a word.--*Paris*",
    "Master Coppenole, in amazement, approached him.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, he placed his hand gayly on his shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo did not stir.--*Paris*",
    "Coppenole went on,----*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo made no reply.--*Paris*",
    "He was, in truth, deaf.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he began to grow impatient with Coppenole's behavior, and suddenly turned towards him with so formidable a gnashing of teeth, that the Flemish giant recoiled, like a bull-dog before a cat.--*Paris*",
    "Then there was created around that strange personage, a circle of terror and respect, whose radius was at least fifteen geometrical feet.--*Paris*",
    "An old woman explained to Coppenole that Quasimodo was deaf.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, all the beggars, all the lackeys, all the cutpurses, joined with the scholars, had gone in procession to seek, in the cupboard of the law clerks' company, the cardboard tiara, and the derisive robe of the Pope of the Fools.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo allowed them to array him in them without wincing, and with a sort of proud docility.--*Paris*",
    "Then they made him seat himself on a motley litter.--*Paris*",
    "Twelve officers of the fraternity of fools raised him on their shoulders; and a sort of bitter and disdainful joy lighted up the morose face of the cyclops, when he beheld beneath his deformed feet all those heads of handsome, straight, well-made men.--*Paris*",
    "Then the ragged and howling procession set out on its march, according to custom, around the inner galleries of the Courts, before making the circuit of the streets and squares.--*Paris*",
    "Book 1 Chapter 6 Esmeralda--*Paris*",
    "We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm.--*Paris*",
    "His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it.--*Paris*",
    "He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.--*Paris*",
    "This gleam of hope acquired fresh life, when he saw Quasimodo, Coppenole, and the deafening escort of the pope of the procession of fools quit the hall amid great uproar.--*Paris*",
    "The throng rushed eagerly after them.--*Paris*",
    "To tell the truth, a few spectators still remained, some scattered, others in groups around the pillars, women, old men, or children, who had had enough of the uproar and tumult.--*Paris*",
    "Some scholars were still perched astride of the window-sills, engaged in gazing into the Place.--*Paris*",
    "An instant later, a symphony which had been intended to produce the greatest effect on the arrival of the Virgin, was lacking.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire perceived that his music had been carried off by the procession of the Pope of the Fools.--*Paris*",
    "He approached a group of bourgeois, who seemed to him to be discussing his piece.--*Paris*",
    "This is the fragment of conversation which he caught,----*Paris*",
    "This word produced a magical effect.--*Paris*",
    "Every one who was left in the hall flew to the windows, climbing the walls in order to see, and repeating, \"La Esmeralda!--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda?\"--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, a great sound of applause was heard from without.--*Paris*",
    "He returned towards the marble table, and saw that the representation had been interrupted.--*Paris*",
    "It was precisely at the instant when Jupiter should have appeared with his thunder.--*Paris*",
    "But Jupiter was standing motionless at the foot of the stage.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire looked.--*Paris*",
    "It was but too true.--*Paris*",
    "All communication between his plot and its solution was intercepted.--*Paris*",
    "This was the last blow.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire received it with resignation.--*Paris*",
    "Then he beat a retreat, with drooping head, but the last in the field, like a general who has fought well.--*Paris*",
    "And as he descended the winding stairs of the courts: \"A fine rabble of asses and dolts these Parisians!\"--*Paris*",
    "he muttered between his teeth; \"they come to hear a mystery and don't listen to it at all!--*Paris*",
    "They are engrossed by every one, by Chopin Trouillefou, by the cardinal, by Coppenole, by Quasimodo, by the devil!--*Paris*",
    "but by Madame the Virgin Mary, not at all.--*Paris*",
    "If I had known, I'd have given you Virgin Mary; you ninnies!--*Paris*",
    "And I!--*Paris*",
    "to come to see faces and behold only backs!--*Paris*",
    "to be a poet, and to reap the success of an apothecary!--*Paris*",
    "It is true that Homerus begged through the Greek towns, and that Naso died in exile among the Muscovites.--*Paris*",
    "But may the devil flay me if I understand what they mean with their Esmeralda!--*Paris*",
    "What is that word, in the first place?--'tis Egyptian!\"--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 1 From Charybdis To Scylia--*Paris*",
    "Night comes on early in January.--*Paris*",
    "The streets were already dark when Gringoire issued forth from the Courts.--*Paris*",
    "This gloom pleased him; he was in haste to reach some obscure and deserted alley, in order there to meditate at his ease, and in order that the philosopher might place the first dressing upon the wound of the poet.--*Paris*",
    "Philosophy, moreover, was his sole refuge, for he did not know where he was to lodge for the night.--*Paris*",
    "After the brilliant failure of his first theatrical venture, he dared not return to the lodging which he occupied in the Rue Grenier-sur-l'Eau, opposite to the Port-au-Foin, having depended upon receiving from monsieur the provost for his epithalamium, the wherewithal to pay Master Guillaume Doulx-Sire, farmer of the taxes on cloven-footed animals in Paris, the rent which he owed him, that is to say, twelve sols parisian; twelve times the value of all that he possessed in the world, including his trunk-hose, his shirt, and his cap.--*Paris*",
    "After reflecting a moment, temporarily sheltered beneath the little wicket of the prison of the treasurer of the Sainte- Chappelle, as to the shelter which he would select for the night, having all the pavements of Paris to choose from, he remembered to have noticed the week previously in the Rue de la Savaterie, at the door of a councillor of the parliament, a stepping stone for mounting a mule, and to have said to himself that that stone would furnish, on occasion, a very excellent pillow for a mendicant or a poet.--*Paris*",
    "He thanked Providence for having sent this happy idea to him; but, as he was preparing to cross the Place, in order to reach the tortuous labyrinth of the city, where meander all those old sister streets, the Rues de la Barillerie, de la Vielle-Draperie, de la Savaterie, de la Juiverie, etc., still extant to-day, with their nine-story houses, he saw the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which was also emerging from the court house, and rushing across the courtyard, with great cries, a great flashing of torches, and the music which belonged to him, Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "This sight revived the pain of his self-love; he fled.--*Paris*",
    "In the bitterness of his dramatic misadventure, everything which reminded him of the festival of that day irritated his wound and made it bleed.--*Paris*",
    "He was on the point of turning to the Pont Saint-Michel; children were running about here and there with fire lances and rockets.--*Paris*",
    "He was roused from his almost lyric ecstacy, by a big double Saint-Jean cracker, which suddenly went off from the happy cabin.--*Paris*",
    "It was the cow ferryman, who was taking his part in the rejoicings of the day, and letting off fireworks.--*Paris*",
    "This cracker made Gringoire's skin bristle up all over.--*Paris*",
    "Then he looked at the Seine at his feet, and a horrible temptation took possession of him:--*Paris*",
    "Then a desperate resolution occurred to him.--*Paris*",
    "It was, since he could not escape from the Pope of the Fools, from Jehan Fourbault's bannerets, from May trusses, from squibs and crackers, to go to the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 2 The Place De Greve--*Paris*",
    "There remains to-day but a very imperceptible vestige of the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, such as it existed then; it consists in the charming little turret, which occupies the angle north of the Place, and which, already enshrouded in the ignoble plaster which fills with paste the delicate lines of its sculpture, would soon have disappeared, perhaps submerged by that flood of new houses which so rapidly devours all the ancient fa?ades of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "The persons who, like ourselves, never cross the Place de Gr\u00e8ve without casting a glance of pity and sympathy on that poor turret strangled between two hovels of the time of Louis XV., can easily reconstruct in their minds the aggregate of edifices to which it belonged, and find again entire in it the ancient Gothic place of the fifteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "It was then, as it is to-day, an irregular trapezoid, bordered on one side by the quay, and on the other three by a series of lofty, narrow, and gloomy houses.--*Paris*",
    "By day, one could admire the variety of its edifices, all sculptured in stone or wood, and already presenting complete specimens of the different domestic architectures of the Middle Ages, running back from the fifteenth to the eleventh century, from the casement which had begun to dethrone the arch, to the Roman semicircle, which had been supplanted by the ogive, and which still occupies, below it, the first story of that ancient house de la Tour Roland, at the corner of the Place upon the Seine, on the side of the street with the Tannerie.--*Paris*",
    "At night, one could distinguish nothing of all that mass of buildings, except the black indentation of the roofs, unrolling their chain of acute angles round the place; for one of the radical differences between the cities of that time, and the cities of the present day, lay in the fa?ades which looked upon the places and streets, and which were then gables.--*Paris*",
    "For the last two centuries the houses have been turned round.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre of the eastern side of the Place, rose a heavy and hybrid construction, formed of three buildings placed in juxtaposition.--*Paris*",
    "It was called by three names which explain its history, its destination, and its architecture: \"The House of the Dauphin,\" because Charles V., when Dauphin, had inhabited it; \"The Marchandise,\" because it had served as town hall; and \"The Pillared House\" (~domus ad piloria~), because of a series of large pillars which sustained the three stories.--*Paris*",
    "The city found there all that is required for a city like Paris; a chapel in which to pray to God; a ~plaidoyer~, or pleading room, in which to hold hearings, and to repel, at need, the King's people; and under the roof, an ~arsenac~ full of artillery.--*Paris*",
    "For the bourgeois of Paris were aware that it is not sufficient to pray in every conjuncture, and to plead for the franchises of the city, and they had always in reserve, in the garret of the town hall, a few good rusty arquebuses.--*Paris*",
    "The Gr\u00e8ve had then that sinister aspect which it preserves to-day from the execrable ideas which it awakens, and from the sombre town hall of Dominique Bocador, which has replaced the Pillared House.--*Paris*",
    "It must be admitted that a permanent gibbet and a pillory, \"a justice and a ladder,\" as they were called in that day, erected side by side in the centre of the pavement, contributed not a little to cause eyes to be turned away from that fatal place, where so many beings full of life and health have agonized; where, fifty years later, that fever of Saint Vallier was destined to have its birth, that terror of the scaffold, the most monstrous of all maladies because it comes not from God, but from man.--*Paris*",
    "It is a consoling idea (let us remark in passing), to think that the death penalty, which three hundred years ago still encumbered with its iron wheels, its stone gibbets, and all its paraphernalia of torture, permanent and riveted to the pavement, the Gr\u00e8ve, the Halles, the Place Dauphine, the Cross du Trahoir, the March\u00e9 aux Pourceaux, that hideous Montfau?on, the barrier des Sergents, the Place aux Chats, the Porte Saint-Denis, Champeaux, the Porte Baudets, the Porte Saint Jacques, without reckoning the innumerable ladders of the provosts, the bishop of the chapters, of the abbots, of the priors, who had the decree of life and death,--without reckoning the judicial drownings in the river Seine; it is consoling to-day, after having lost successively all the pieces of its armor, its luxury of torment, its penalty of imagination and fancy, its torture for which it reconstructed every five years a leather bed at the Grand Chatelet, that ancient suzerain of feudal society almost expunged from our laws and our cities, hunted from code to code, chased from place to place, has no longer, in our immense Paris, any more than a dishonored corner of the Gr\u00e8ve,--than a miserable guillotine, furtive, uneasy, shameful, which seems always afraid of being caught in the act, so quickly does it disappear after having dealt its blow.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 3 Kisses For Blows--*Paris*",
    "When Pierre Gringoire arrived on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, he was paralyzed.--*Paris*",
    "He had directed his course across the Pont aux Meuniers, in order to avoid the rabble on the Pont au Change, and the pennons of Jehan Fourbault; but the wheels of all the bishop's mills had splashed him as he passed, and his doublet was drenched; it seemed to him besides, that the failure of his piece had rendered him still more sensible to cold than usual.--*Paris*",
    "Hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire, which was burning magnificently in the middle of the Place.--*Paris*",
    "But a considerable crowd formed a circle around it.--*Paris*",
    "On looking more closely, he perceived that the circle was much larger than was required simply for the purpose of getting warm at the king's fire, and that this concourse of people had not been attracted solely by the beauty of the hundred fagots which were burning.--*Paris*",
    "In a vast space left free between the crowd and the fire, a young girl was dancing.--*Paris*",
    "Whether this young girl was a human being, a fairy, or an angel, is what Gringoire, sceptical philosopher and ironical poet that he was, could not decide at the first moment, so fascinated was he by this dazzling vision.--*Paris*",
    "She was not tall, though she seemed so, so boldly did her slender form dart about.--*Paris*",
    "She was swarthy of complexion, but one divined that, by day, her skin must possess that beautiful golden tone of the Andalusians and the Roman women.--*Paris*",
    "Her little foot, too, was Andalusian, for it was both pinched and at ease in its graceful shoe.--*Paris*",
    "She danced, she turned, she whirled rapidly about on an old Persian rug, spread negligently under her feet; and each time that her radiant face passed before you, as she whirled, her great black eyes darted a flash of lightning at you.--*Paris*",
    "All around her, all glances were riveted, all mouths open; and, in fact, when she danced thus, to the humming of the Basque tambourine, which her two pure, rounded arms raised above her head, slender, frail and vivacious as a wasp, with her corsage of gold without a fold, her variegated gown puffing out, her bare shoulders, her delicate limbs, which her petticoat revealed at times, her black hair, her eyes of flame, she was a supernatural creature.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, one of the salamander's braids of hair became unfastened, and a piece of yellow copper which was attached to it, rolled to the ground.--*Paris*",
    "All illusions had disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "She began her dance once more; she took from the ground two swords, whose points she rested against her brow, and which she made to turn in one direction, while she turned in the other; it was a purely gypsy effect.--*Paris*",
    "But, disenchanted though Gringoire was, the whole effect of this picture was not without its charm and its magic; the bonfire illuminated, with a red flaring light, which trembled, all alive, over the circle of faces in the crowd, on the brow of the young girl, and at the background of the Place cast a pallid reflection, on one side upon the ancient, black, and wrinkled fa?ade of the House of Pillars, on the other, upon the old stone gibbet.--*Paris*",
    "Among the thousands of visages which that light tinged with scarlet, there was one which seemed, even more than all the others, absorbed in contemplation of the dancer.--*Paris*",
    "It was the face of a man, austere, calm, and sombre.--*Paris*",
    "This man, whose costume was concealed by the crowd which surrounded him, did not appear to be more than five and thirty years of age; nevertheless, he was bald; he had merely a few tufts of thin, gray hair on his temples; his broad, high forehead had begun to be furrowed with wrinkles, but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary youthfulness, an ardent life, a profound passion.--*Paris*",
    "He kept them fixed incessantly on the gypsy, and, while the giddy young girl of sixteen danced and whirled, for the pleasure of all, his revery seemed to become more and more sombre.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time, a smile and a sigh met upon his lips, but the smile was more melancholy than the sigh.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl, stopped at length, breathless, and the people applauded her lovingly.--*Paris*",
    "Then Gringoire saw come up to her, a pretty little white goat, alert, wide-awake, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hoofs, and gilded collar, which he had not hitherto perceived, and which had remained lying curled up on one corner of the carpet watching his mistress dance.--*Paris*",
    "And, seating herself, she gracefully presented her tambourine to the goat.--*Paris*",
    "The goat lifted its fore foot, and struck one blow upon the tambourine.--*Paris*",
    "It was the first month in the year, in fact.--*Paris*",
    "Djali raised his little gilt hoof, and struck six blows on the tambourine.--*Paris*",
    "Djali struck seven blows.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the clock of the Pillar House rang out seven.--*Paris*",
    "The people were amazed.--*Paris*",
    "She shuddered and turned round; but applause broke forth and drowned the morose exclamation.--*Paris*",
    "It even effaced it so completely from her mind, that she continued to question her goat.--*Paris*",
    "Djali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching along with so much dainty gravity, that the entire circle of spectators burst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the captain of pistoliers.--*Paris*",
    "The goat seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving his fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of the bad French, and worse Latin, Jacques Charmolue was there complete,--gesture, accent, and attitude.--*Paris*",
    "And the crowd applauded louder than ever.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy turned round once more.--*Paris*",
    "Big blanks, little blanks, targes* and eagle liards showered into it.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, she passed in front of Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire put his hand so recklessly into his pocket that she halted.--*Paris*",
    "If he had all Peru in his pocket, he would certainly have given it to the dancer; but Gringoire had not Peru, and, moreover, America had not yet been discovered.--*Paris*",
    "Happily, an unexpected incident came to his rescue.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl turned round in affright.--*Paris*",
    "It was no longer the voice of the bald man; it was the voice of a woman, bigoted and malicious.--*Paris*",
    "However, this cry, which alarmed the gypsy, delighted a troop of children who were prowling about there.--*Paris*",
    "All rushed towards the Pillar House.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, Gringoire had taken advantage of the dancer's embarrassment, to disappear.--*Paris*",
    "The children's shouts had reminded him that he, also, had not supped, so he ran to the public buffet.--*Paris*",
    "But the little rascals had better legs than he; when he arrived, they had stripped the table.--*Paris*",
    "There remained not so much as a miserable ~camichon~ at five sous the pound.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing remained upon the wall but slender fleurs-de-lis, mingled with rose bushes, painted in 1434 by Mathieu Biterne.--*Paris*",
    "It was a meagre supper.--*Paris*",
    "It is an unpleasant thing to go to bed without supper, it is a still less pleasant thing not to sup and not to know where one is to sleep.--*Paris*",
    "That was Gringoire's condition.--*Paris*",
    "No supper, no shelter; he saw himself pressed on all sides by necessity, and he found necessity very crabbed.--*Paris*",
    "He had long ago discovered the truth, that Jupiter created men during a fit of misanthropy, and that during a wise man's whole life, his destiny holds his philosophy in a state of siege.--*Paris*",
    "As for himself, he had never seen the blockade so complete; he heard his stomach sounding a parley, and he considered it very much out of place that evil destiny should capture his philosophy by famine.--*Paris*",
    "This melancholy revery was absorbing him more and more, when a song, quaint but full of sweetness, suddenly tore him from it.--*Paris*",
    "It was the young gypsy who was singing.--*Paris*",
    "Her voice was like her dancing, like her beauty.--*Paris*",
    "It was indefinable and charming; something pure and sonorous, aerial, winged, so to speak.--*Paris*",
    "There were continual outbursts, melodies, unexpected cadences, then simple phrases strewn with aerial and hissing notes; then floods of scales which would have put a nightingale to rout, but in which harmony was always present; then soft modulations of octaves which rose and fell, like the bosom of the young singer.--*Paris*",
    "Her beautiful face followed, with singular mobility, all the caprices of her song, from the wildest inspiration to the chastest dignity.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced her now a mad creature, now a queen.--*Paris*",
    "The words which she sang were in a tongue unknown to Gringoire, and which seemed to him to be unknown to herself, so little relation did the expression which she imparted to her song bear to the sense of the words.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, these four lines, in her mouth, were madly gay,----*Paris*",
    "And an instant afterwards, at the accents which she imparted to this stanza,----*Paris*",
    "Gringoire felt the tears start to his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, her song breathed joy, most of all, and she seemed to sing like a bird, from serenity and heedlessness.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy's song had disturbed Gringoire's revery as the swan disturbs the water.--*Paris*",
    "He listened in a sort of rapture, and forgetfulness of everything.--*Paris*",
    "It was the first moment in the course of many hours when he did not feel that he suffered.--*Paris*",
    "The moment was brief.--*Paris*",
    "The same woman's voice, which had interrupted the gypsy's dance, interrupted her song.--*Paris*",
    "The poor \"cricket\" stopped short.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire covered up his ears.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the other spectators murmured like himself; \"To the devil with the sacked nun!\"--*Paris*",
    "said some of them.--*Paris*",
    "And the old invisible kill-joy might have had occasion to repent of her aggressions against the gypsy had their attention not been diverted at this moment by the procession of the Pope of the Fools, which, after having traversed many streets and squares, debouched on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, with all its torches and all its uproar.--*Paris*",
    "This procession, which our readers have seen set out from the Palais de Justice, had organized on the way, and had been recruited by all the knaves, idle thieves, and unemployed vagabonds in Paris; so that it presented a very respectable aspect when it arrived at the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "First came Egypt.--*Paris*",
    "The Duke of Egypt headed it, on horseback, with his counts on foot holding his bridle and stirrups for him; behind them, the male and female Egyptians, pell-mell, with their little children crying on their shoulders; all--duke, counts, and populace--in rags and tatters.--*Paris*",
    "Then came the Kingdom of Argot; that is to say, all the thieves of France, arranged according to the order of their dignity; the minor people walking first.--*Paris*",
    "Thus defiled by fours, with the divers insignia of their grades, in that strange faculty, most of them lame, some cripples, others one-armed, shop clerks, pilgrim, ~hubins~, bootblacks, thimble-riggers, street arabs, beggars, the blear-eyed beggars, thieves, the weakly, vagabonds, merchants, sham soldiers, goldsmiths, passed masters of pickpockets, isolated thieves.--*Paris*",
    "A catalogue that would weary Homer.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre of the conclave of the passed masters of pickpockets, one had some difficulty in distinguishing the King of Argot, the grand co?sre, so called, crouching in a little cart drawn by two big dogs.--*Paris*",
    "After the kingdom of the Argotiers, came the Empire of Galilee.--*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rousseau, Emperor of the Empire of Galilee, marched majestically in his robe of purple, spotted with wine, preceded by buffoons wrestling and executing military dances; surrounded by his macebearers, his pickpockets and clerks of the chamber of accounts.--*Paris*",
    "Last of all came the corporation of law clerks, with its maypoles crowned with flowers, its black robes, its music worthy of the orgy, and its large candles of yellow wax.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre of this crowd, the grand officers of the Brotherhood of Fools bore on their shoulders a litter more loaded down with candles than the reliquary of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve in time of pest; and on this litter shone resplendent, with crosier, cope, and mitre, the new Pope of the Fools, the bellringer of Notre-Dame, Quasimodo the hunchback.--*Paris*",
    "Each section of this grotesque procession had its own music.--*Paris*",
    "The Egyptians made their drums and African tambourines resound.--*Paris*",
    "The slang men, not a very musical race, still clung to the goat's horn trumpet and the Gothic rubebbe of the twelfth century.--*Paris*",
    "The Empire of Galilee was not much more advanced; among its music one could hardly distinguish some miserable rebec, from the infancy of the art, still imprisoned in the ~re-la-mi~.--*Paris*",
    "But it was around the Pope of the Fools that all the musical riches of the epoch were displayed in a magnificent discord.--*Paris*",
    "It was nothing but soprano rebecs, counter-tenor rebecs, and tenor rebecs, not to reckon the flutes and brass instruments.--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "our readers will remember that this was Gringoire's orchestra.--*Paris*",
    "It is difficult to convey an idea of the degree of proud and blissful expansion to which the sad and hideous visage of Quasimodo had attained during the transit from the Palais de Justice, to the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "It was the first enjoyment of self-love that he had ever experienced.--*Paris*",
    "Down to that day, he had known only humiliation, disdain for his condition, disgust for his person.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, deaf though he was, he enjoyed, like a veritable pope, the acclamations of that throng, which he hated because he felt that he was hated by it.--*Paris*",
    "What mattered it that his people consisted of a pack of fools, cripples, thieves, and beggars?--*Paris*",
    "it was still a people and he was its sovereign.--*Paris*",
    "And he accepted seriously all this ironical applause, all this derisive respect, with which the crowd mingled, it must be admitted, a good deal of very real fear.--*Paris*",
    "For the hunchback was robust; for the bandy-legged fellow was agile; for the deaf man was malicious: three qualities which temper ridicule.--*Paris*",
    "We are far from believing, however, that the new Pope of the Fools understood both the sentiments which he felt and the sentiments which he inspired.--*Paris*",
    "The spirit which was lodged in this failure of a body had, necessarily, something incomplete and deaf about it.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, what he felt at the moment was to him, absolutely vague, indistinct, and confused.--*Paris*",
    "Only joy made itself felt, only pride dominated.--*Paris*",
    "Around that sombre and unhappy face, there hung a radiance.--*Paris*",
    "It was, then, not without surprise and alarm, that at the very moment when Quasimodo was passing the Pillar House, in that semi-intoxicated state, a man was seen to dart from the crowd, and to tear from his hands, with a gesture of anger, his crosier of gilded wood, the emblem of his mock popeship.--*Paris*",
    "This man, this rash individual, was the man with the bald brow, who, a moment earlier, standing with the gypsy's group had chilled the poor girl with his words of menace and of hatred.--*Paris*",
    "He was dressed in an eccleslastical costume.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he stood forth from the crowd, Gringoire, who had not noticed him up to that time, recognized him: \"Hold!\"--*Paris*",
    "he said, with an exclamation of astonishment.--*Paris*",
    "A cry of terror arose, in fact.--*Paris*",
    "The formidable Quasimodo had hurled himself from the litter, and the women turned aside their eyes in order not to see him tear the archdeacon asunder.--*Paris*",
    "He made one bound as far as the priest, looked at him, and fell upon his knees.--*Paris*",
    "The priest tore off his tiara, broke his crozier, and rent his tinsel cope.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo remained on his knees, with head bent and hands clasped.--*Paris*",
    "Then there was established between them a strange dialogue of signs and gestures, for neither of them spoke.--*Paris*",
    "The priest, erect on his feet, irritated, threatening, imperious; Quasimodo, prostrate, humble, suppliant.--*Paris*",
    "And, nevertheless, it is certain that Quasimodo could have crushed the priest with his thumb.--*Paris*",
    "At length the archdeacon, giving Quasimodo's powerful shoulder a rough shake, made him a sign to rise and follow him.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo rose.--*Paris*",
    "Then the Brotherhood of Fools, their first stupor having passed off, wished to defend their pope, so abruptly dethroned.--*Paris*",
    "The Egyptians, the men of slang, and all the fraternity of law clerks, gathered howling round the priest.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo placed himself in front of the priest, set in play the muscles of his athletic fists, and glared upon the assailants with the snarl of an angry tiger.--*Paris*",
    "The priest resumed his sombre gravity, made a sign to Quasimodo, and retired in silence.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo walked in front of him, scattering the crowd as he passed.--*Paris*",
    "When they had traversed the populace and the Place, the cloud of curious and idle were minded to follow them.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo then constituted himself the rearguard, and followed the archdeacon, walking backwards, squat, surly, monstrous, bristling, gathering up his limbs, licking his boar's tusks, growling like a wild beast, and imparting to the crowd immense vibrations, with a look or a gesture.--*Paris*",
    "Both were allowed to plunge into a dark and narrow street, where no one dared to venture after them; so thoroughly did the mere chimera of Quasimodo gnashing his teeth bar the entrance.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 4 The Inconveniences Of Following A Pretty Wom--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire set out to follow the gypsy at all hazards.--*Paris*",
    "He had seen her, accompanied by her goat, take to the Rue de la Coutellerie; he took the Rue de la Coutellerie.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, a practical philosopher of the streets of Paris, had noticed that nothing is more propitious to revery than following a pretty woman without knowing whither she is going.--*Paris*",
    "There was in this voluntary abdication of his freewill, in this fancy submitting itself to another fancy, which suspects it not, a mixture of fantastic independence and blind obedience, something indescribable, intermediate between slavery and liberty, which pleased Gringoire,--a spirit essentially compound, undecided, and complex, holding the extremities of all extremes, incessantly suspended between all human propensities, and neutralizing one by the other.--*Paris*",
    "He was fond of comparing himself to Mahomet's coffin, attracted in two different directions by two loadstones, and hesitating eternally between the heights and the depths, between the vault and the pavement, between fall and ascent, between zenith and nadir.--*Paris*",
    "If Gringoire had lived in our day, what a fine middle course he would hold between classicism and romanticism!--*Paris*",
    "But he was not sufficiently primitive to live three hundred years, and 'tis a pity.--*Paris*",
    "His absence is a void which is but too sensibly felt to-day.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, for the purpose of thus following passers-by (and especially female passers-by) in the streets, which Gringoire was fond of doing, there is no better disposition than ignorance of where one is going to sleep.--*Paris*",
    "So he walked along, very thoughtfully, behind the young girl, who hastened her pace and made her goat trot as she saw the bourgeois returning home and the taverns--the only shops which had been open that day--closing.--*Paris*",
    "And in the points of suspense which he placed after this reticence in his mind, there lay I know not what flattering ideas.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, from time to time, as he passed the last groups of bourgeois closing their doors, he caught some scraps of their conversation, which broke the thread of his pleasant hypotheses.--*Paris*",
    "Now it was two old men accosting each other.--*Paris*",
    "Further on there were two female neighbors at their windows, holding candles, which the fog caused to sputter.--*Paris*",
    "And the windows were closed.--*Paris*",
    "But Gringoire had lost the thread of his ideas, nevertheless.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together without difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to Djali, who still walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures, whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship; regarding them both as goats,--so far as the lightness, agility, and dexterity of their walk were concerned.--*Paris*",
    "But the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment.--*Paris*",
    "The curfew had sounded long ago, and it was only at rare intervals now that they encountered a passer-by in the street, or a light in the windows.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire had become involved, in his pursuit of the gypsy, in that inextricable labyrinth of alleys, squares, and closed courts which surround the ancient sepulchre of the Saints-Innocents, and which resembles a ball of thread tangled by a cat.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl's attention had been attracted to him for the last few moments; she had repeatedly turned her head towards him with uneasiness; she had even once come to a standstill, and taking advantage of a ray of light which escaped from a half-open bakery to survey him intently, from head to foot, then, having cast this glance, Gringoire had seen her make that little pout which he had already noticed, after which she passed on.--*Paris*",
    "This little pout had furnished Gringoire with food for thought.--*Paris*",
    "There was certainly both disdain and mockery in that graceful grimace.--*Paris*",
    "So he dropped his head, began to count the paving-stones, and to follow the young girl at a little greater distance, when, at the turn of a street, which had caused him to lose sight of her, he heard her utter a piercing cry.--*Paris*",
    "He hastened his steps.--*Paris*",
    "The street was full of shadows.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, a twist of tow soaked in oil, which burned in a cage at the feet of the Holy Virgin at the street corner, permitted Gringoire to make out the gypsy struggling in the arms of two men, who were endeavoring to stifle her cries.--*Paris*",
    "The poor little goat, in great alarm, lowered his horns and bleated.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire did not take to flight, but neither did he advance another step.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo came up to him, tossed him four paces away on the pavement with a backward turn of the hand, and plunged rapidly into the gloom, bearing the young girl folded across one arm like a silken scarf.--*Paris*",
    "His companion followed him, and the poor goat ran after them all, bleating plaintively.--*Paris*",
    "It was a captain of the king's archers, armed from head to foot, with his sword in his hand.--*Paris*",
    "He tore the gypsy from the arms of the dazed Quasimodo, threw her across his saddle, and at the moment when the terrible hunchback, recovering from his surprise, rushed upon him to regain his prey, fifteen or sixteen archers, who followed their captain closely, made their appearance, with their two-edged swords in their fists.--*Paris*",
    "It was a squad of the king's police, which was making the rounds, by order of Messire Robert d'Estouteville, guard of the provostship of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was surrounded, seized, garroted; he roared, he foamed at the mouth, he bit; and had it been broad daylight, there is no doubt that his face alone, rendered more hideous by wrath, would have put the entire squad to flight.--*Paris*",
    "But by night he was deprived of his most formidable weapon, his ugliness.--*Paris*",
    "His companion had disappeared during the struggle.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy gracefully raised herself upright upon the officer's saddle, placed both hands upon the young man's shoulders, and gazed fixedly at him for several seconds, as though enchanted with his good looks and with the aid which he had just rendered her.--*Paris*",
    "Then breaking silence first, she said to him, making her sweet voice still sweeter than usual,----*Paris*",
    "And while Captain Phoebus was turning up his moustache in Burgundian fashion, she slipped from the horse, like an arrow falling to earth, and fled.--*Paris*",
    "A flash of lightning would have vanished less quickly.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 5 Result Of The Dangers--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, thoroughly stunned by his fall, remained on the pavement in front of the Holy Virgin at the street corner.--*Paris*",
    "Little by little, he regained his senses; at first, for several minutes, he was floating in a sort of half-somnolent revery, which was not without its charm, in which aeriel figures of the gypsy and her goat were coupled with Quasimodo's heavy fist.--*Paris*",
    "This state lasted but a short time.--*Paris*",
    "A decidedly vivid sensation of cold in the part of his body which was in contact with the pavement, suddenly aroused him and caused his spirit to return to the surface.--*Paris*",
    "The word \"alchemists\" suddenly suggested to his mind the idea of Archdeacon Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "He recalled the violent scene which he had just witnessed in part; that the gypsy was struggling with two men, that Quasimodo had a companion; and the morose and haughty face of the archdeacon passed confusedly through his memory.--*Paris*",
    "The place was, in fact, becoming less and less tenable.--*Paris*",
    "Each molecule of the gutter bore away a molecule of heat radiating from Gringoire's loins, and the equilibrium between the temperature of his body and the temperature of the brook, began to be established in rough fashion.--*Paris*",
    "Quite a different annoyance suddenly assailed him.--*Paris*",
    "A group of children, those little bare-footed savages who have always roamed the pavements of Paris under the eternal name of ~gamins~, and who, when we were also children ourselves, threw stones at all of us in the afternoon, when we came out of school, because our trousers were not torn--a swarm of these young scamps rushed towards the square where Gringoire lay, with shouts and laughter which seemed to pay but little heed to the sleep of the neighbors.--*Paris*",
    "They were dragging after them some sort of hideous sack; and the noise of their wooden shoes alone would have roused the dead.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire who was not quite dead yet, half raised himself.--*Paris*",
    "And behold, they flung the pallet directly upon Gringoire, beside whom they had arrived, without espying him.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, one of them took a handful of straw and set off to light it at the wick of the good Virgin.--*Paris*",
    "It was a critical moment.--*Paris*",
    "He was caught between fire and water; he made a superhuman effort, the effort of a counterfeiter of money who is on the point of being boiled, and who seeks to escape.--*Paris*",
    "He rose to his feet, flung aside the straw pallet upon the street urchins, and fled.--*Paris*",
    "And they fled in their turn.--*Paris*",
    "The straw mattress remained master of the field.--*Paris*",
    "Belleforet, Father Le Juge, and Corrozet affirm that it was picked up on the morrow, with great pomp, by the clergy of the quarter, and borne to the treasury of the church of Saint Opportune, where the sacristan, even as late as 1789, earned a tolerably handsome revenue out of the great miracle of the Statue of the Virgin at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, which had, by its mere presence, on the memorable night between the sixth and seventh of January, 1482, exorcised the defunct Eustache Moubon, who, in order to play a trick on the devil, had at his death maliciously concealed his soul in his straw pallet.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 6 The Broken Jug--*Paris*",
    "After having run for some time at the top of his speed, without knowing whither, knocking his head against many a street corner, leaping many a gutter, traversing many an alley, many a court, many a square, seeking flight and passage through all the meanderings of the ancient passages of the Halles, exploring in his panic terror what the fine Latin of the maps calls ~tota via, cheminum et viaria~, our poet suddenly halted for lack of breath in the first place, and in the second, because he had been collared, after a fashion, by a dilemma which had just occurred to his mind.--*Paris*",
    "Then he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his nose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the blessed pallet again, but in vain.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing to be found but intersections of houses, closed courts, and crossings of streets, in the midst of which he hesitated and doubted incessantly, being more perplexed and entangled in this medley of streets than he would have been even in the labyrinth of the H?tel des Tournelles.--*Paris*",
    "At length he lost patience, and exclaimed solemnly: \"Cursed be cross roads!--*Paris*",
    "This exclamation afforded him a little solace, and a sort of reddish reflection which he caught sight of at that moment, at the extremity of a long and narrow lane, completed the elevation of his moral tone.--*Paris*",
    "Did he address this fragment of litany to the Holy Virgin, or to the pallet?--*Paris*",
    "We are utterly unable to say.--*Paris*",
    "He had taken but a few steps in the long street, which sloped downwards, was unpaved, and more and more muddy and steep, when he noticed a very singular thing.--*Paris*",
    "It was not deserted; here and there along its extent crawled certain vague and formless masses, all directing their course towards the light which flickered at the end of the street, like those heavy insects which drag along by night, from blade to blade of grass, towards the shepherd's fire.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing renders one so adventurous as not being able to feel the place where one's pocket is situated.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire continued to advance, and had soon joined that one of the forms which dragged along most indolently, behind the others.--*Paris*",
    "On drawing near, he perceived that it was nothing else than a wretched legless cripple in a bowl, who was hopping along on his two hands like a wounded field-spider which has but two legs left.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he passed close to this species of spider with a human countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: \"~La buona mancia, signor!--*Paris*",
    "la buona mancia~!--*Paris*",
    "And he passed on.--*Paris*",
    "He overtook another of these itinerant masses, and examined it.--*Paris*",
    "It was an impotent man, both halt and crippled, and halt and crippled to such a degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which sustained him, gave him the air of a mason's scaffolding on the march.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, who liked noble and classical comparisons, compared him in thought to the living tripod of Vulcan.--*Paris*",
    "This living tripod saluted him as he passed, but stopping his hat on a level with Gringoire's chin, like a shaving dish, while he shouted in the latter's ears: \"~Senor cabellero, para comprar un pedaso de pan~!--*Paris*",
    "He was minded to augment his pace, but for the third time something barred his way.--*Paris*",
    "This something or, rather, some one was a blind man, a little blind fellow with a bearded, Jewish face, who, rowing away in the space about him with a stick, and towed by a large dog, droned through his nose with a Hungarian accent: \"~Facitote caritatem~!\"--*Paris*",
    "That said, he turned his back upon the blind man, and pursued his way.--*Paris*",
    "But the blind man began to increase his stride at the same time; and, behold!--*Paris*",
    "the cripple and the legless man, in his bowl, came up on their side in great haste, and with great clamor of bowl and crutches, upon the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "Then all three, jostling each other at poor Gringoire's heels, began to sing their song to him,----*Paris*",
    "And the lame man took up the musical phrase by repeating: \"~Un pedaso de pan~!\"--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire stopped up his ears.--*Paris*",
    "He set out to run.--*Paris*",
    "The blind man ran!--*Paris*",
    "The lame man ran!--*Paris*",
    "The cripple in the bowl ran!--*Paris*",
    "And then, in proportion as he plunged deeper into the street, cripples in bowls, blind men and lame men, swarmed about him, and men with one arm, and with one eye, and the leprous with their sores, some emerging from little streets adjacent, some from the air-holes of cellars, howling, bellowing, yelping, all limping and halting, all flinging themselves towards the light, and humped up in the mire, like snails after a shower.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, still followed by his three persecutors, and not knowing very well what was to become of him, marched along in terror among them, turning out for the lame, stepping over the cripples in bowls, with his feet imbedded in that ant-hill of lame men, like the English captain who got caught in the quicksand of a swarm of crabs.--*Paris*",
    "The idea occurred to him of making an effort to retrace his steps.--*Paris*",
    "But it was too late.--*Paris*",
    "This whole legion had closed in behind him, and his three beggars held him fast.--*Paris*",
    "So he proceeded, impelled both by this irresistible flood, by fear, and by a vertigo which converted all this into a sort of horrible dream.--*Paris*",
    "At last he reached the end of the street.--*Paris*",
    "It opened upon an immense place, where a thousand scattered lights flickered in the confused mists of night.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire flew thither, hoping to escape, by the swiftness of his legs, from the three infirm spectres who had clutched him.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime the legless man, erect upon his feet, crowned Gringoire with his heavy iron bowl, and the blind man glared in his face with flaming eyes!--*Paris*",
    "They replied by a burst of sinister laughter.--*Paris*",
    "The poor poet cast his eyes about him.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in truth, that redoubtable Cour des Miracles, whither an honest man had never penetrated at such an hour; the magic circle where the officers of the Chatelet and the sergeants of the provostship, who ventured thither, disappeared in morsels; a city of thieves, a hideous wart on the face of Paris; a sewer, from which escaped every morning, and whither returned every night to crouch, that stream of vices, of mendicancy and vagabondage which always overflows in the streets of capitals; a monstrous hive, to which returned at nightfall, with their booty, all the drones of the social order; a lying hospital where the bohemian, the disfrocked monk, the ruined scholar, the ne'er-do-wells of all nations, Spaniards, Italians, Germans,--of all religions, Jews, Christians, Mahometans, idolaters, covered with painted sores, beggars by day, were transformed by night into brigands; an immense dressing-room, in a word, where, at that epoch, the actors of that eternal comedy, which theft, prostitution, and murder play upon the pavements of Paris, dressed and undressed.--*Paris*",
    "It was a vast place, irregular and badly paved, like all the squares of Paris at that date.--*Paris*",
    "Fires, around which swarmed strange groups, blazed here and there.--*Paris*",
    "Every one was going, coming, and shouting.--*Paris*",
    "Shrill laughter was to be heard, the wailing of children, the voices of women.--*Paris*",
    "The hands and heads of this throng, black against the luminous background, outlined against it a thousand eccentric gestures.--*Paris*",
    "At times, upon the ground, where trembled the light of the fires, mingled with large, indefinite shadows, one could behold a dog passing, which resembled a man, a man who resembled a dog.--*Paris*",
    "The limits of races and species seemed effaced in this city, as in a pandemonium.--*Paris*",
    "Men, women, beasts, age, sex, health, maladies, all seemed to be in common among these people; all went together, they mingled, confounded, superposed; each one there participated in all.--*Paris*",
    "The poor and flickering flames of the fire permitted Gringoire to distinguish, amid his trouble, all around the immense place, a hideous frame of ancient houses, whose wormeaten, shrivelled, stunted fa?ades, each pierced with one or two lighted attic windows, seemed to him, in the darkness, like enormous heads of old women, ranged in a circle, monstrous and crabbed, winking as they looked on at the Witches' Sabbath.--*Paris*",
    "It was like a new world, unknown, unheard of, misshapen, creeping, swarming, fantastic.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, more and more terrified, clutched by the three beggars as by three pairs of tongs, dazed by a throng of other faces which frothed and yelped around him, unhappy Gringoire endeavored to summon his presence of mind, in order to recall whether it was a Saturday.--*Paris*",
    "But his efforts were vain; the thread of his memory and of his thought was broken; and, doubting everything, wavering between what he saw and what he felt, he put to himself this unanswerable question,----*Paris*",
    "At that moment, a distinct cry arose in the buzzing throng which surrounded him, \"Let's take him to the king!--*Paris*",
    "let's take him to the king!\"--*Paris*",
    "They dragged him off.--*Paris*",
    "Each vied with the other in laying his claws upon him.--*Paris*",
    "But the three beggars did not loose their hold and tore him from the rest, howling, \"He belongs to us!\"--*Paris*",
    "The poet's already sickly doublet yielded its last sigh in this struggle.--*Paris*",
    "While traversing the horrible place, his vertigo vanished.--*Paris*",
    "After taking a few steps, the sentiment of reality returned to him.--*Paris*",
    "He began to become accustomed to the atmosphere of the place.--*Paris*",
    "At the first moment there had arisen from his poet's head, or, simply and prosaically, from his empty stomach, a mist, a vapor, so to speak, which, spreading between objects and himself, permitted him to catch a glimpse of them only in the incoherent fog of nightmare,--in those shadows of dreams which distort every outline, agglomerating objects into unwieldy groups, dilating things into chimeras, and men into phantoms.--*Paris*",
    "Little by little, this hallucination was succeeded by a less bewildered and exaggerating view.--*Paris*",
    "Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes, struck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry with which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded.--*Paris*",
    "He was forced to perceive that he was not walking in the Styx, but in mud, that he was elbowed not by demons, but by thieves; that it was not his soul which was in question, but his life (since he lacked that precious conciliator, which places itself so effectually between the bandit and the honest man--a purse).--*Paris*",
    "In short, on examining the orgy more closely, and with more coolness, he fell from the witches' sabbath to the dram-shop.--*Paris*",
    "The Cour des Miracles was, in fact, merely a dram-shop; but a brigand's dram-shop, reddened quite as much with blood as with wine.--*Paris*",
    "The spectacle which presented itself to his eyes, when his ragged escort finally deposited him at the end of his trip, was not fitted to bear him back to poetry, even to the poetry of hell.--*Paris*",
    "It was more than ever the prosaic and brutal reality of the tavern.--*Paris*",
    "Were we not in the fifteenth century, we would say that Gringoire had descended from Michael Angelo to Callot.--*Paris*",
    "Around a great fire which burned on a large, circular flagstone, the flames of which had heated red-hot the legs of a tripod, which was empty for the moment, some wormeaten tables were placed, here and there, haphazard, no lackey of a geometrical turn having deigned to adjust their parallelism, or to see to it that they did not make too unusual angles.--*Paris*",
    "Upon these tables gleamed several dripping pots of wine and beer, and round these pots were grouped many bacchic visages, purple with the fire and the wine.--*Paris*",
    "There was a man with a huge belly and a jovial face, noisily kissing a woman of the town, thickset and brawny.--*Paris*",
    "There was a sort of sham soldier, a \"naquois,\" as the slang expression runs, who was whistling as he undid the bandages from his fictitious wound, and removing the numbness from his sound and vigorous knee, which had been swathed since morning in a thousand ligatures.--*Paris*",
    "On the other hand, there was a wretched fellow, preparing with celandine and beef's blood, his \"leg of God,\" for the next day.--*Paris*",
    "Two tables further on, a palmer, with his pilgrim's costume complete, was practising the lament of the Holy Queen, not forgetting the drone and the nasal drawl.--*Paris*",
    "Further on, a young scamp was taking a lesson in epilepsy from an old pretender, who was instructing him in the art of foaming at the mouth, by chewing a morsel of soap.--*Paris*",
    "Beside him, a man with the dropsy was getting rid of his swelling, and making four or five female thieves, who were disputing at the same table, over a child who had been stolen that evening, hold their noses.--*Paris*",
    "All circumstances which, two centuries later, \"seemed so ridiculous to the court,\" as Sauval says, \"that they served as a pastime to the king, and as an introduction to the royal ballet of Night, divided into four parts and danced on the theatre of the Petit-Bourbon.\"--*Paris*",
    "Loud laughter everywhere, and obscene songs.--*Paris*",
    "Each one held his own course, carping and swearing, without listening to his neighbor.--*Paris*",
    "Pots clinked, and quarrels sprang up at the shock of the pots, and the broken pots made rents in the rags.--*Paris*",
    "A big dog, seated on his tail, gazed at the fire.--*Paris*",
    "Some children were mingled in this orgy.--*Paris*",
    "The stolen child wept and cried.--*Paris*",
    "Another, a big boy four years of age, seated with legs dangling, upon a bench that was too high for him, before a table that reached to his chin, and uttering not a word.--*Paris*",
    "A third, gravely spreading out upon the table with his finger, the melted tallow which dripped from a candle.--*Paris*",
    "Last of all, a little fellow crouching in the mud, almost lost in a cauldron, which he was scraping with a tile, and from which he was evoking a sound that would have made Stradivarius swoon.--*Paris*",
    "Near the fire was a hogshead, and on the hogshead a beggar.--*Paris*",
    "This was the king on his throne.--*Paris*",
    "The three who had Gringoire in their clutches led him in front of this hogshead, and the entire bacchanal rout fell silent for a moment, with the exception of the cauldron inhabited by the child.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire dared neither breathe nor raise his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile the king addressed him, from the summit of his cask,----*Paris*",
    "Gringoire shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "That voice, although accentuated by menace, recalled to him another voice, which, that very morning, had dealt the deathblow to his mystery, by drawling, nasally, in the midst of the audience, \"Charity, please!\"--*Paris*",
    "He raised his head.--*Paris*",
    "It was indeed Clopin Trouillefou.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin Trouillefou, arrayed in his royal insignia, wore neither one rag more nor one rag less.--*Paris*",
    "The sore upon his arm had already disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "He held in his hand one of those whips made of thongs of white leather, which police sergeants then used to repress the crowd, and which were called ~boullayes~.--*Paris*",
    "On his head he wore a sort of headgear, bound round and closed at the top.--*Paris*",
    "But it was difficult to make out whether it was a child's cap or a king's crown, the two things bore so strong a resemblance to each other.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile Gringoire, without knowing why, had regained some hope, on recognizing in the King of the Cour des Miracles his accursed mendicant of the Grand Hall.--*Paris*",
    "The harangue was formidable.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin interrupted him: \"I believe that you are trying to blarney us with your jargon.--*Paris*",
    "Zounds!--*Paris*",
    "let yourself be hung, and don't kick up such a row over it!\"--*Paris*",
    "His unlucky voice was, in fact, drowned in the uproar which rose around him.--*Paris*",
    "The little boy scraped away at his cauldron with more spirit than ever; and, to crown all, an old woman had just placed on the tripod a frying-pan of grease, which hissed away on the fire with a noise similar to the cry of a troop of children in pursuit of a masker.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, Clopin Trouillefou appeared to hold a momentary conference with the Duke of Egypt, and the Emperor of Galilee, who was completely drunk.--*Paris*",
    "Then he shouted shrilly: \"Silence!\"--*Paris*",
    "and, as the cauldron and the frying-pan did not heed him, and continued their duet, he jumped down from his hogshead, gave a kick to the boiler, which rolled ten paces away bearing the child with it, a kick to the frying-pan, which upset in the fire with all its grease, and gravely remounted his throne, without troubling himself about the stifled tears of the child, or the grumbling of the old woman, whose supper was wasting away in a fine white flame.--*Paris*",
    "Trouillefou made a sign, and the duke, the emperor, and the passed masters of pickpockets, and the isolated robbers, came and ranged themselves around him in a horseshoe, of which Gringoire, still roughly held by the body, formed the centre.--*Paris*",
    "It was a semicircle of rags, tatters, tinsel, pitchforks, axes, legs staggering with intoxication, huge, bare arms, faces sordid, dull, and stupid.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of this Round Table of beggary, Clopin Trouillefou,--as the doge of this senate, as the king of this peerage, as the pope of this conclave,-- dominated; first by virtue of the height of his hogshead, and next by virtue of an indescribable, haughty, fierce, and formidable air, which caused his eyes to flash, and corrected in his savage profile the bestial type of the race of vagabonds.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced him a boar amid a herd of swine.--*Paris*",
    "The reader can judge of the effect which this proposition produced upon Gringoire, who beheld life slipping away from him, and who was beginning to lose his hold upon it.--*Paris*",
    "He clutched at it again with energy.--*Paris*",
    "The King of Thunes scowled.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire tried to slip in some excuse between these curt words, which wrath rendered more and more jerky.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, he pointed his finger at the little, bearded Hungarian Jew who had accosted Gringoire with his ~facitote caritatem~, and who, understanding no other language beheld with surprise the King of Thunes's ill-humor overflow upon him.--*Paris*",
    "At length Monsieur Clopin calmed down.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin made a sign.--*Paris*",
    "Several thieves detached themselves from the circle, and returned a moment later.--*Paris*",
    "They brought two thick posts, terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them stand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross-beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty portable gibbet, which Gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him, in a twinkling.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing was lacking, not even the rope, which swung gracefully over the cross-beam.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire mounted the stool, and succeeded, not without some oscillations of head and arms, in regaining his centre of gravity.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin tossed his head.--*Paris*",
    "The band of thieves applauded Clopin's words, and arranged themselves in a circle round the gibbet, with a laugh so pitiless that Gringoire perceived that he amused them too much not to have everything to fear from them.--*Paris*",
    "No hope was left for him, accordingly, unless it were the slight chance of succeeding in the formidable operation which was imposed upon him; he decided to risk it, but it was not without first having addressed a fervent prayer to the manikin he was about to plunder, and who would have been easier to move to pity than the vagabonds.--*Paris*",
    "These myriad bells, with their little copper tongues, seemed to him like the mouths of so many asps, open and ready to sting and to hiss.--*Paris*",
    "He made one more attempt upon Trouillefou.--*Paris*",
    "Perceiving that no respite, nor reprieve, nor subterfuge was possible, he bravely decided upon his course of action; he wound his right foot round his left leg, raised himself on his left foot, and stretched out his arm: but at the moment when his hand touched the manikin, his body, which was now supported upon one leg only, wavered on the stool which had but three; he made an involuntary effort to support himself by the manikin, lost his balance, and fell heavily to the ground, deafened by the fatal vibration of the thousand bells of the manikin, which, yielding to the impulse imparted by his hand, described first a rotary motion, and then swayed majestically between the two posts.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, he heard the dreadful peal above his head, the diabolical laughter of the vagabonds, and the voice of Trouillefou saying,----*Paris*",
    "The thieves made him mount the stool, Clopin came to him, passed the rope about his neck, and, tapping him on the shoulder,----*Paris*",
    "The word \"Mercy!\"--*Paris*",
    "died away upon Gringoire's lips.--*Paris*",
    "He cast his eyes about him; but there was no hope: all were laughing.--*Paris*",
    "Bellevigne de l'Etoile nimbly mounted the transverse beam, and in another minute, Gringoire, on raising his eyes, beheld him, with terror, seated upon the beam above his head.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "But he paused, as though struck by a sudden thought.--*Paris*",
    "This law of the vagabonds, singular as it may strike the reader, remains to-day written out at length, in ancient English legislation.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire breathed again.--*Paris*",
    "This was the second time that he had returned to life within an hour.--*Paris*",
    "So he did not dare to trust to it too implicitly.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, no doubt, was not very appetizing in this miserable condition.--*Paris*",
    "The female vagabonds did not seem to be much affected by the proposition.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy wretch heard them answer: \"No!--*Paris*",
    "no!--*Paris*",
    "hang him; there'll be the more fun for us all!\"--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, three emerged from the throng and came to smell of him.--*Paris*",
    "The first was a big wench, with a square face.--*Paris*",
    "She examined the philosopher's deplorable doublet attentively.--*Paris*",
    "His garment was worn, and more full of holes than a stove for roasting chestnuts.--*Paris*",
    "The girl made a wry face.--*Paris*",
    "The second,--old, black, wrinkled, hideous, with an ugliness conspicuous even in the Cour des Miracles, trotted round Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "He almost trembled lest she should want him.--*Paris*",
    "But she mumbled between her teeth, \"He's too thin,\" and went off.--*Paris*",
    "The third was a young girl, quite fresh, and not too ugly.--*Paris*",
    "Then rising to his feet, upon his hogshead.--*Paris*",
    "Bellevigne de l'Etoile, Andry the Red, Fran?ois Chante-Prune, stepped up to Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment a cry arose among the thieves: \"La Esmeralda!--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda!\"--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire shuddered, and turned towards the side whence the clamor proceeded.--*Paris*",
    "The crowd opened, and gave passage to a pure and dazzling form.--*Paris*",
    "It was the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "This rare creature seemed, even in the Cour des Miracles, to exercise her sway of charm and beauty.--*Paris*",
    "The vagabonds, male and female, ranged themselves gently along her path, and their brutal faces beamed beneath her glance.--*Paris*",
    "She approached the victim with her light step.--*Paris*",
    "Her pretty Djali followed her.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was more dead than alive.--*Paris*",
    "She examined him for a moment in silence.--*Paris*",
    "She made her pretty little pout with her under lip.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire firmly believed that he had been in a dream ever since morning, and that this was the continuation of it.--*Paris*",
    "The change was, in fact, violent, though a gratifying one.--*Paris*",
    "They undid the noose, and made the poet step down from the stool.--*Paris*",
    "His emotion was so lively that he was obliged to sit down.--*Paris*",
    "The Duke of Egypt brought an earthenware crock, without uttering a word.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy offered it to Gringoire: \"Fling it on the ground,\" said she.--*Paris*",
    "The crock broke into four pieces.--*Paris*",
    "Book 2 Chapter 7 A Bridal Night--*Paris*",
    "A few moments later our poet found himself in a tiny arched chamber, very cosy, very warm, seated at a table which appeared to ask nothing better than to make some loans from a larder hanging near by, having a good bed in prospect, and alone with a pretty girl.--*Paris*",
    "The adventure smacked of enchantment.--*Paris*",
    "He began seriously to take himself for a personage in a fairy tale; he cast his eyes about him from time to time to time, as though to see if the chariot of fire, harnessed to two-winged chimeras, which alone could have so rapidly transported him from Tartarus to Paradise, were still there.--*Paris*",
    "At times, also, he fixed his eyes obstinately upon the holes in his doublet, in order to cling to reality, and not lose the ground from under his feet completely.--*Paris*",
    "His reason, tossed about in imaginary space, now hung only by this thread.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl did not appear to pay any attention to him; she went and came, displaced a stool, talked to her goat, and indulged in a pout now and then.--*Paris*",
    "At last she came and seated herself near the table, and Gringoire was able to scrutinize her at his ease.--*Paris*",
    "You have been a child, reader, and you would, perhaps, be very happy to be one still.--*Paris*",
    "It is quite certain that you have not, more than once (and for my part, I have passed whole days, the best employed of my life, at it) followed from thicket to thicket, by the side of running water, on a sunny day, a beautiful green or blue dragon-fly, breaking its flight in abrupt angles, and kissing the tips of all the branches.--*Paris*",
    "You recollect with what amorous curiosity your thought and your gaze were riveted upon this little whirlwind, hissing and humming with wings of purple and azure, in the midst of which floated an imperceptible body, veiled by the very rapidity of its movement.--*Paris*",
    "The aerial being which was dimly outlined amid this quivering of wings, appeared to you chimerical, imaginary, impossible to touch, impossible to see.--*Paris*",
    "But when, at length, the dragon-fly alighted on the tip of a reed, and, holding your breath the while, you were able to examine the long, gauze wings, the long enamel robe, the two globes of crystal, what astonishment you felt, and what fear lest you should again behold the form disappear into a shade, and the creature into a chimera!--*Paris*",
    "Recall these impressions, and you will readily appreciate what Gringoire felt on contemplating, beneath her visible and palpable form, that Esmeralda of whom, up to that time, he had only caught a glimpse, amidst a whirlwind of dance, song, and tumult.--*Paris*",
    "Sinking deeper and deeper into his revery: \"So this,\" he said to himself, following her vaguely with his eyes, \"is la Esmeralda!--*Paris*",
    "a celestial creature!--*Paris*",
    "a street dancer!--*Paris*",
    "so much, and so little!--*Paris*",
    "With this idea in his head and in his eyes, he stepped up to the young girl in a manner so military and so gallant that she drew back.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy opened her great eyes.--*Paris*",
    "And, quite ingenuously, he clasped her waist.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy's corsage slipped through his hands like the skin of an eel.--*Paris*",
    "She bounded from one end of the tiny room to the other, stooped down, and raised herself again, with a little poniard in her hand, before Gringoire had even had time to see whence the poniard came; proud and angry, with swelling lips and inflated nostrils, her cheeks as red as an api apple,* and her eyes darting lightnings.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, the white goat placed itself in front of her, and presented to Gringoire a hostile front, bristling with two pretty horns, gilded and very sharp.--*Paris*",
    "All this took place in the twinkling of an eye.--*Paris*",
    "The dragon-fly had turned into a wasp, and asked nothing better than to sting.--*Paris*",
    "Our philosopher was speechless, and turned his astonished eyes from the goat to the young girl.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy broke the silence on her side.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire bit his lips.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile Esmeralda's dagger and the goat's horns were still upon the defensive.--*Paris*",
    "The truth is, Gringoire was, like M. Despreaux, \"not very voluptuous.\"--*Paris*",
    "He did not belong to that chevalier and musketeer species, who take young girls by assault.--*Paris*",
    "In the matter of love, as in all other affairs, he willingly assented to temporizing and adjusting terms; and a good supper, and an amiable t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate appeared to him, especially when he was hungry, an excellent interlude between the prologue and the catastrophe of a love adventure.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy did not reply.--*Paris*",
    "She made her disdainful little grimace, drew up her head like a bird, then burst out laughing, and the tiny poniard disappeared as it had come, without Gringoire being able to see where the wasp concealed its sting.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, there stood upon the table a loaf of rye bread, a slice of bacon, some wrinkled apples and a jug of beer.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire began to eat eagerly.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said, to hear the furious clashing of his iron fork and his earthenware plate, that all his love had turned to appetite.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl seated opposite him, watched him in silence, visibly preoccupied with another thought, at which she smiled from time to time, while her soft hand caressed the intelligent head of the goat, gently pressed between her knees.--*Paris*",
    "A candle of yellow wax illuminated this scene of voracity and revery.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the first cravings of his stomach having been stilled, Gringoire felt some false shame at perceiving that nothing remained but one apple.--*Paris*",
    "She replied by a negative sign of the head, and her pensive glance fixed itself upon the vault of the ceiling.--*Paris*",
    "He raised his voice, \"Mademoiselle!\"--*Paris*",
    "She seemed not to hear him.--*Paris*",
    "He repeated, still more loudly, \"Mademoiselle Esmeralda!\"--*Paris*",
    "Trouble wasted.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl's mind was elsewhere, and Gringoire's voice had not the power to recall it.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately, the goat interfered.--*Paris*",
    "She began to pull her mistress gently by the sleeve.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, Gringoire did not give her time to resume her revery.--*Paris*",
    "He hazarded a delicate question.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl looked at him intently, and said, \"No.\"--*Paris*",
    "She pouted, and replied, \"No.\"--*Paris*",
    "She gazed fixedly at him again, and said, after a momentary reflection, \"Perhaps.\"--*Paris*",
    "This \"perhaps,\" so dear to philosophers, emboldened Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "The street dancer had a beauty as she spoke thus, that struck Gringoire singularly, and seemed to him in perfect keeping with the almost oriental exaltation of her words.--*Paris*",
    "Her pure, red lips half smiled; her serene and candid brow became troubled, at intervals, under her thoughts, like a mirror under the breath; and from beneath her long, drooping, black eyelashes, there escaped a sort of ineffable light, which gave to her profile that ideal serenity which Raphael found at the mystic point of intersection of virginity, maternity, and divinity.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, Gringoire continued,----*Paris*",
    "She remained thoughtful for a moment, then said with a peculiar expression: \"That I shall know soon.\"--*Paris*",
    "She cast a grave glance upon him and said,----*Paris*",
    "Gringoire colored, and took the hint.--*Paris*",
    "It was evident that the young girl was alluding to the slight assistance which he had rendered her in the critical situation in which she had found herself two hours previously.--*Paris*",
    "This memory, effaced by his own adventures of the evening, now recurred to him.--*Paris*",
    "He smote his brow.--*Paris*",
    "This question made the gypsy shudder.--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda smiled, sighed, and remained silent.--*Paris*",
    "Silence ensued.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire slashed the table with his knife.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl smiled and seemed to be gazing through the wall at something.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she began to sing in a barely articulate voice,----*Paris*",
    "She broke off abruptly, and began to caress Djali.--*Paris*",
    "She drew from her bosom a sort of little oblong bag, suspended from her neck by a string of adr\u00e9zarach beads.--*Paris*",
    "This bag exhaled a strong odor of camphor.--*Paris*",
    "It was covered with green silk, and bore in its centre a large piece of green glass, in imitation of an emerald.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was on the point of taking the bag in his hand.--*Paris*",
    "She drew back.--*Paris*",
    "The poet's curiosity was more and more aroused.--*Paris*",
    "She laid one finger on her mouth and concealed the amulet in her bosom.--*Paris*",
    "He tried a few more questions, but she hardly replied.--*Paris*",
    "She began to sing, to an ancient air,-- ~Mon p\u00e8re est oiseau, Ma m\u00e8re est oiselle.--*Paris*",
    "B Je passe l'eau sans nacelle, Je passe l'eau sans bateau, Ma m\u00e8re est oiselle, Mon p\u00e8re est oiseau~.--*Paris*",
    "She retired into her laconics again.--*Paris*",
    "She made her customary pretty grimace.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire ceased, awaiting the effect of his harangue on the young girl.--*Paris*",
    "Her eyes were fixed on the ground.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, without exactly understanding what the connection could be between his address and this question, was not sorry to display his erudition.--*Paris*",
    "Assuming an air of importance, he replied,----*Paris*",
    "At that moment, one of her bracelets became unfastened and fell.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire stooped quickly to pick it up; when he straightened up, the young girl and the goat had disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "He heard the sound of a bolt.--*Paris*",
    "It was a little door, communicating, no doubt, with a neighboring cell, which was being fastened on the outside.--*Paris*",
    "He made the tour of his cell.--*Paris*",
    "There was no piece of furniture adapted to sleeping purposes, except a tolerably long wooden coffer; and its cover was carved, to boot; which afforded Gringoire, when he stretched himself out upon it, a sensation somewhat similar to that which Microm\u00e9gas would feel if he were to lie down on the Alps.--*Paris*",
    "Book 3 Chapter 1 Notre-dame--*Paris*",
    "The church of Notre-Dame de Paris is still no doubt, a majestic and sublime edifice.--*Paris*",
    "But, beautiful as it has been preserved in growing old, it is difficult not to sigh, not to wax indignant, before the numberless degradations and mutilations which time and men have both caused the venerable monument to suffer, without respect for Charlemagne, who laid its first stone, or for Philip Augustus, who laid the last.--*Paris*",
    "On the face of this aged queen of our cathedrals, by the side of a wrinkle, one always finds a scar.--*Paris*",
    "If we had leisure to examine with the reader, one by one, the diverse traces of destruction imprinted upon the old church, time's share would be the least, the share of men the most, especially the men of art, since there have been individuals who assumed the title of architects during the last two centuries.--*Paris*",
    "And, in the first place, to cite only a few leading examples, there certainly are few finer architectural pages than this fa?ade, where, successively and at once, the three portals hollowed out in an arch; the broidered and dentated cordon of the eight and twenty royal niches; the immense central rose window, flanked by its two lateral windows, like a priest by his deacon and subdeacon; the frail and lofty gallery of trefoil arcades, which supports a heavy platform above its fine, slender columns; and lastly, the two black and massive towers with their slate penthouses, harmonious parts of a magnificent whole, superposed in five gigantic stories;--develop themselves before the eye, in a mass and without confusion, with their innumerable details of statuary, carving, and sculpture, joined powerfully to the tranquil grandeur of the whole; a vast symphony in stone, so to speak; the colossal work of one man and one people, all together one and complex, like the Iliads and the Romanceros, whose sister it is; prodigious product of the grouping together of all the forces of an epoch, where, upon each stone, one sees the fancy of the workman disciplined by the genius of the artist start forth in a hundred fashions; a sort of human creation, in a word, powerful and fecund as the divine creation of which it seems to have stolen the double character,--variety, eternity.--*Paris*",
    "And what we here say of the fa?ade must be said of the entire church; and what we say of the cathedral church of Paris, must be said of all the churches of Christendom in the Middle Ages.--*Paris*",
    "All things are in place in that art, self-created, logical, and well proportioned.--*Paris*",
    "To measure the great toe of the foot is to measure the giant.--*Paris*",
    "Let us return to the fa?ade of Notre-Dame, as it still appears to us, when we go piously to admire the grave and puissant cathedral, which inspires terror, so its chronicles assert: ~quoe mole sua terrorem incutit spectantibus~.--*Paris*",
    "Three important things are to-day lacking in that fa?ade: in the first place, the staircase of eleven steps which formerly raised it above the soil; next, the lower series of statues which occupied the niches of the three portals; and lastly the upper series, of the twenty-eight most ancient kings of France, which garnished the gallery of the first story, beginning with Childebert, and ending with Phillip Augustus, holding in his hand \"the imperial apple.\"--*Paris*",
    "Time has caused the staircase to disappear, by raising the soil of the city with a slow and irresistible progress; but, while thus causing the eleven steps which added to the majestic height of the edifice, to be devoured, one by one, by the rising tide of the pavements of Paris,--time has bestowed upon the church perhaps more than it has taken away, for it is time which has spread over the fa?ade that sombre hue of the centuries which makes the old age of monuments the period of their beauty.--*Paris*",
    "But who has thrown down the two rows of statues?--*Paris*",
    "who has left the niches empty?--*Paris*",
    "who has cut, in the very middle of the central portal, that new and bastard arch?--*Paris*",
    "who has dared to frame therein that commonplace and heavy door of carved wood, \u00e0 la Louis XV., beside the arabesques of Biscornette?--*Paris*",
    "The men, the architects, the artists of our day.--*Paris*",
    "And if we enter the interior of the edifice, who has overthrown that colossus of Saint Christopher, proverbial for magnitude among statues, as the grand hall of the Palais de Justice was among halls, as the spire of Strasbourg among spires?--*Paris*",
    "And those myriads of statues, which peopled all the spaces between the columns of the nave and the choir, kneeling, standing, equestrian, men, women, children, kings, bishops, gendarmes, in stone, in marble, in gold, in silver, in copper, in wax even,--who has brutally swept them away?--*Paris*",
    "It is not time.--*Paris*",
    "And who substituted for the ancient gothic altar, splendidly encumbered with shrines and reliquaries, that heavy marble sarcophagus, with angels' heads and clouds, which seems a specimen pillaged from the Val-de-Grace or the Invalides?--*Paris*",
    "Who stupidly sealed that heavy anachronism of stone in the Carlovingian pavement of Hercandus?--*Paris*",
    "Was it not Louis XIV., fulfilling the request of Louis XIII.--*Paris*",
    "And who put the cold, white panes in the place of those windows,\" high in color, \"which caused the astonished eyes of our fathers to hesitate between the rose of the grand portal and the arches of the apse?--*Paris*",
    "And what would a sub-chanter of the sixteenth century say, on beholding the beautiful yellow wash, with which our archiepiscopal vandals have desmeared their cathedral?--*Paris*",
    "He would remember that it was the color with which the hangman smeared \"accursed\" edifices; he would recall the H?tel du Petit-Bourbon, all smeared thus, on account of the constable's treason.--*Paris*",
    "And if we ascend the cathedral, without mentioning a thousand barbarisms of every sort,--what has become of that charming little bell tower, which rested upon the point of intersection of the cross-roofs, and which, no less frail and no less bold than its neighbor (also destroyed), the spire of the Sainte-Chapelle, buried itself in the sky, farther forward than the towers, slender, pointed, sonorous, carved in open work.--*Paris*",
    "An architect of good taste amputated it (1787), and considered it sufficient to mask the wound with that large, leaden plaster, which resembles a pot cover.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, to sum up the points which we have just indicated, three sorts of ravages to-day disfigure Gothic architecture.--*Paris*",
    "Wrinkles and warts on the epidermis; this is the work of time.--*Paris*",
    "Deeds of violence, brutalities, contusions, fractures; this is the work of the revolutions from Luther to Mirabeau.--*Paris*",
    "Mutilations, amputations, dislocation of the joints, \"restorations\"; this is the Greek, Roman, and barbarian work of professors according to Vitruvius and Vignole.--*Paris*",
    "This magnificent art produced by the Vandals has been slain by the academies.--*Paris*",
    "The centuries, the revolutions, which at least devastate with impartiality and grandeur, have been joined by a cloud of school architects, licensed, sworn, and bound by oath; defacing with the discernment and choice of bad taste, substituting the ~chicor\u00e9es~ of Louis XV.--*Paris*",
    "for the Gothic lace, for the greater glory of the Parthenon.--*Paris*",
    "It is the kick of the ass at the dying lion.--*Paris*",
    "It is the old oak crowning itself, and which, to heap the measure full, is stung, bitten, and gnawed by caterpillars.--*Paris*",
    "How far it is from the epoch when Robert Cenalis, comparing Notre-Dame de Paris to the famous temple of Diana at Ephesus, *so much lauded by the ancient pagans*, which Erostatus *has* immortalized, found the Gallic temple \"more excellent in length, breadth, height, and structure.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame is not, moreover, what can be called a complete, definite, classified monument.--*Paris*",
    "It is no longer a Romanesque church; nor is it a Gothic church.--*Paris*",
    "This edifice is not a type.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame de Paris has not, like the Abbey of Tournus, the grave and massive frame, the large and round vault, the glacial bareness, the majestic simplicity of the edifices which have the rounded arch for their progenitor.--*Paris*",
    "It is not, like the Cathedral of Bourges, the magnificent, light, multiform, tufted, bristling efflorescent product of the pointed arch.--*Paris*",
    "Impossible to class it in that ancient family of sombre, mysterious churches, low and crushed as it were by the round arch, almost Egyptian, with the exception of the ceiling; all hieroglyphics, all sacerdotal, all symbolical, more loaded in their ornaments, with lozenges and zigzags, than with flowers, with flowers than with animals, with animals than with men; the work of the architect less than of the bishop; first transformation of art, all impressed with theocratic and military discipline, taking root in the Lower Empire, and stopping with the time of William the Conqueror.--*Paris*",
    "Impossible to place our Cathedral in that other family of lofty, aerial churches, rich in painted windows and sculpture; pointed in form, bold in attitude; communal and bourgeois as political symbols; free, capricious, lawless, as a work of art; second transformation of architecture, no longer hieroglyphic, immovable and sacerdotal, but artistic, progressive, and popular, which begins at the return from the crusades, and ends with Louis IX.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame de Paris is not of pure Romanesque, like the first; nor of pure Arabian race, like the second.--*Paris*",
    "It is an edifice of the transition period.--*Paris*",
    "The Saxon architect completed the erection of the first pillars of the nave, when the pointed arch, which dates from the Crusade, arrived and placed itself as a conqueror upon the large Romanesque capitals which should support only round arches.--*Paris*",
    "The pointed arch, mistress since that time, constructed the rest of the church.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, timid and inexperienced at the start, it sweeps out, grows larger, restrains itself, and dares no longer dart upwards in spires and lancet windows, as it did later on, in so many marvellous cathedrals.--*Paris*",
    "One would say that it were conscious of the vicinity of the heavy Romanesque pillars.--*Paris*",
    "However, these edifices of the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic, are no less precious for study than the pure types.--*Paris*",
    "They express a shade of the art which would be lost without them.--*Paris*",
    "It is the graft of the pointed upon the round arch.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame de Paris is, in particular, a curious specimen of this variety.--*Paris*",
    "Each face, each stone of the venerable monument, is a page not only of the history of the country, but of the history of science and art as well.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, in order to indicate here only the principal details, while the little Red Door almost attains to the limits of the Gothic delicacy of the fifteenth century, the pillars of the nave, by their size and weight, go back to the Carlovingian Abbey of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s.--*Paris*",
    "One would suppose that six centuries separated these pillars from that door.--*Paris*",
    "There is no one, not even the hermetics, who does not find in the symbols of the grand portal a satisfactory compendium of their science, of which the Church of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was so complete a hieroglyph.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, the Roman abbey, the philosophers' church, the Gothic art, Saxon art, the heavy, round pillar, which recalls Gregory VII., the hermetic symbolism, with which Nicolas Flamel played the prelude to Luther, papal unity, schism, Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s, Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie,--all are mingled, combined, amalgamated in Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "This central mother church is, among the ancient churches of Paris, a sort of chimera; it has the head of one, the limbs of another, the haunches of another, something of all.--*Paris*",
    "We repeat it, these hybrid constructions are not the least interesting for the artist, for the antiquarian, for the historian.--*Paris*",
    "They make one feel to what a degree architecture is a primitive thing, by demonstrating (what is also demonstrated by the cyclopean vestiges, the pyramids of Egypt, the gigantic Hindoo pagodas) that the greatest products of architecture are less the works of individuals than of society; rather the offspring of a nation's effort, than the inspired flash of a man of genius; the deposit left by a whole people; the heaps accumulated by centuries; the residue of successive evaporations of human society,--in a word, species of formations.--*Paris*",
    "Each wave of time contributes its alluvium, each race deposits its layer on the monument, each individual brings his stone.--*Paris*",
    "Thus do the beavers, thus do the bees, thus do men.--*Paris*",
    "The great symbol of architecture, Babel, is a hive.--*Paris*",
    "Great edifices, like great mountains, are the work of centuries.--*Paris*",
    "Art often undergoes a transformation while they are pending, ~pendent opera interrupta~; they proceed quietly in accordance with the transformed art.--*Paris*",
    "The new art takes the monument where it finds it, incrusts itself there, assimilates it to itself, develops it according to its fancy, and finishes it if it can.--*Paris*",
    "The thing is accomplished without trouble, without effort, without reaction,--following a natural and tranquil law.--*Paris*",
    "It is a graft which shoots up, a sap which circulates, a vegetation which starts forth anew.--*Paris*",
    "Certainly there is matter here for many large volumes, and often the universal history of humanity in the successive engrafting of many arts at many levels, upon the same monument.--*Paris*",
    "The man, the artist, the individual, is effaced in these great masses, which lack the name of their author; human intelligence is there summed up and totalized.--*Paris*",
    "Time is the architect, the nation is the builder.--*Paris*",
    "Not to consider here anything except the Christian architecture of Europe, that younger sister of the great masonries of the Orient, it appears to the eyes as an immense formation divided into three well-defined zones, which are superposed, the one upon the other: the Romanesque zone*, the Gothic zone, the zone of the Renaissance, which we would gladly call the Greco-Roman zone.--*Paris*",
    "The Roman layer, which is the most ancient and deepest, is occupied by the round arch, which reappears, supported by the Greek column, in the modern and upper layer of the Renaissance.--*Paris*",
    "The pointed arch is found between the two.--*Paris*",
    "The edifices which belong exclusively to any one of these three layers are perfectly distinct, uniform, and complete.--*Paris*",
    "There is the Abbey of Jumi\u00e9ges, there is the Cathedral of Reims, there is the Sainte-Croix of Orleans.--*Paris*",
    "But the three zones mingle and amalgamate along the edges, like the colors in the solar spectrum.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, complex monuments, edifices of gradation and transition.--*Paris*",
    "One is Roman at the base, Gothic in the middle, Greco-Roman at the top.--*Paris*",
    "It is because it was six hundred years in building.--*Paris*",
    "This variety is rare.--*Paris*",
    "The donjon keep of d'Etampes is a specimen of it.--*Paris*",
    "But monuments of two formations are more frequent.--*Paris*",
    "There is Notre-Dame de Paris, a pointed-arch edifice, which is imbedded by its pillars in that Roman zone, in which are plunged the portal of Saint-Denis, and the nave of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s.--*Paris*",
    "There is the charming, half-Gothic chapter-house of Bocherville, where the Roman layer extends half way up.--*Paris*",
    "There is the cathedral of Rouen, which would be entirely Gothic if it did not bathe the tip of its central spire in the zone of the Renaissance.--*Paris*",
    "Their faces not all alike, nor yet different, but such as the faces of sisters ought to be.--*Paris*",
    "However, all these shades, all these differences, do not affect the surfaces of edifices only.--*Paris*",
    "It is art which has changed its skin.--*Paris*",
    "The very constitution of the Christian church is not attacked by it.--*Paris*",
    "There is always the same internal woodwork, the same logical arrangement of parts.--*Paris*",
    "Whatever may be the carved and embroidered envelope of a cathedral, one always finds beneath it--in the state of a germ, and of a rudiment at the least--the Roman basilica.--*Paris*",
    "It is eternally developed upon the soil according to the same law.--*Paris*",
    "There are, invariably, two naves, which intersect in a cross, and whose upper portion, rounded into an apse, forms the choir; there are always the side aisles, for interior processions, for chapels,--a sort of lateral walks or promenades where the principal nave discharges itself through the spaces between the pillars.--*Paris*",
    "That settled, the number of chapels, doors, bell towers, and pinnacles are modified to infinity, according to the fancy of the century, the people, and art.--*Paris*",
    "The service of religion once assured and provided for, architecture does what she pleases.--*Paris*",
    "Statues, stained glass, rose windows, arabesques, denticulations, capitals, bas-reliefs,--she combines all these imaginings according to the arrangement which best suits her.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, the prodigious exterior variety of these edifices, at whose foundation dwells so much order and unity.--*Paris*",
    "The trunk of a tree is immovable; the foliage is capricious.--*Paris*",
    "Book 3 Chapter 2 A Bird's -eye View Of Paris--*Paris*",
    "We have just attempted to restore, for the reader's benefit, that admirable church of Notre-Dame de Paris.--*Paris*",
    "We have briefly pointed out the greater part of the beauties which it possessed in the fifteenth century, and which it lacks to-day; but we have omitted the principal thing,--the view of Paris which was then to be obtained from the summits of its towers.--*Paris*",
    "That was, in fact,--when, after having long groped one's way up the dark spiral which perpendicularly pierces the thick wall of the belfries, one emerged, at last abruptly, upon one of the lofty platforms inundated with light and air,--that was, in fact, a fine picture which spread out, on all sides at once, before the eye; a spectacle ~sui generis~, of which those of our readers who have had the good fortune to see a Gothic city entire, complete, homogeneous,--a few of which still remain, Nuremberg in Bavaria and Vittoria in Spain,--can readily form an idea; or even smaller specimens, provided that they are well preserved,--Vitr\u00e9 in Brittany, Nordhausen in Prussia.--*Paris*",
    "The Paris of three hundred and fifty years ago--the Paris of the fifteenth century--was already a gigantic city.--*Paris*",
    "We Parisians generally make a mistake as to the ground which we think that we have gained, since Paris has not increased much over one-third since the time of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "It has certainly lost more in beauty than it has gained in size.--*Paris*",
    "Paris had its birth, as the reader knows, in that old island of the City which has the form of a cradle.--*Paris*",
    "The strand of that island was its first boundary wall, the Seine its first moat.--*Paris*",
    "Paris remained for many centuries in its island state, with two bridges, one on the north, the other on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time its gates and its fortresses,--the Grand-Chatelet on the right bank, the Petit-Chatelet on the left.--*Paris*",
    "Then, from the date of the kings of the first race, Paris, being too cribbed and confined in its island, and unable to return thither, crossed the water.--*Paris*",
    "Then, beyond the Grand, beyond the Petit-Chatelet, a first circle of walls and towers began to infringe upon the country on the two sides of the Seine.--*Paris*",
    "Some vestiges of this ancient enclosure still remained in the last century; to-day, only the memory of it is left, and here and there a tradition, the Baudets or Baudoyer gate, \"Porte Bagauda\".--*Paris*",
    "Little by little, the tide of houses, always thrust from the heart of the city outwards, overflows, devours, wears away, and effaces this wall.--*Paris*",
    "Philip Augustus makes a new dike for it.--*Paris*",
    "He imprisons Paris in a circular chain of great towers, both lofty and solid.--*Paris*",
    "For the period of more than a century, the houses press upon each other, accumulate, and raise their level in this basin, like water in a reservoir.--*Paris*",
    "They begin to deepen; they pile story upon story; they mount upon each other; they gush forth at the top, like all laterally compressed growth, and there is a rivalry as to which shall thrust its head above its neighbors, for the sake of getting a little air.--*Paris*",
    "The street glows narrower and deeper, every space is overwhelmed and disappears.--*Paris*",
    "The houses finally leap the wall of Philip Augustus, and scatter joyfully over the plain, without order, and all askew, like runaways.--*Paris*",
    "There they plant themselves squarely, cut themselves gardens from the fields, and take their ease.--*Paris*",
    "Beginning with 1367, the city spreads to such an extent into the suburbs, that a new wall becomes necessary, particularly on the right bank; Charles V. builds it.--*Paris*",
    "But a city like Paris is perpetually growing.--*Paris*",
    "It is only such cities that become capitals.--*Paris*",
    "They are funnels, into which all the geographical, political, moral, and intellectual water-sheds of a country, all the natural slopes of a people, pour; wells of civilization, so to speak, and also sewers, where commerce, industry, intelligence, population,--all that is sap, all that is life, all that is the soul of a nation, filters and amasses unceasingly, drop by drop, century by century.--*Paris*",
    "So Charles V.'s wall suffered the fate of that of Philip Augustus.--*Paris*",
    "At the end of the fifteenth century, the Faubourg strides across it, passes beyond it, and runs farther.--*Paris*",
    "In the sixteenth, it seems to retreat visibly, and to bury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick had the new city already become outside of it.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, beginning with the fifteenth century, where our story finds us, Paris had already outgrown the three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of Julian the Apostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the Grand-Chatelet and the Petit-Chatelet.--*Paris*",
    "The mighty city had cracked, in succession, its four enclosures of walls, like a child grown too large for his garments of last year.--*Paris*",
    "Under Louis XI., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced at intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall, like the summits of hills in an inundation,--like archipelagos of the old Paris submerged beneath the new.--*Paris*",
    "Since that time Paris has undergone yet another transformation, unfortunately for our eyes; but it has passed only one more wall, that of Louis XV., that miserable wall of mud and spittle, worthy of the king who built it, worthy of the poet who sung it,----*Paris*",
    "In the fifteenth century, Paris was still divided into three wholly distinct and separate towns, each having its own physiognomy, its own specialty, its manners, customs, privileges, and history: the City, the University, the Town.--*Paris*",
    "The City, which occupied the island, was the most ancient, the smallest, and the mother of the other two, crowded in between them like (may we be pardoned the comparison) a little old woman between two large and handsome maidens.--*Paris*",
    "The University covered the left bank of the Seine, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, points which correspond in the Paris of to-day, the one to the wine market, the other to the mint.--*Paris*",
    "Its wall included a large part of that plain where Julian had built his hot baths.--*Paris*",
    "The hill of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve was enclosed in it.--*Paris*",
    "The culminating point of this sweep of walls was the Papal gate, that is to say, near the present site of the Pantheon.--*Paris*",
    "The Town, which was the largest of the three fragments of Paris, held the right bank.--*Paris*",
    "Its quay, broken or interrupted in many places, ran along the Seine, from the Tour de Billy to the Tour du Bois; that is to say, from the place where the granary stands to-day, to the present site of the Tuileries.--*Paris*",
    "These four points, where the Seine intersected the wall of the capital, the Tournelle and the Tour de Nesle on the right, the Tour de Billy and the Tour du Bois on the left, were called pre-eminently, \"the four towers of Paris.\"--*Paris*",
    "The Town encroached still more extensively upon the fields than the University.--*Paris*",
    "The culminating point of the Town wall (that of Charles V.) was at the gates of Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, whose situation has not been changed.--*Paris*",
    "As we have just said, each of these three great divisions of Paris was a town, but too special a town to be complete, a city which could not get along without the other two.--*Paris*",
    "Hence three entirely distinct aspects: churches abounded in the City; palaces, in the Town; and colleges, in the University.--*Paris*",
    "Neglecting here the originalities, of secondary importance in old Paris, and the capricious regulations regarding the public highways, we will say, from a general point of view, taking only masses and the whole group, in this chaos of communal jurisdictions, that the island belonged to the bishop, the right bank to the provost of the merchants, the left bank to the Rector; over all ruled the provost of Paris, a royal not a municipal official.--*Paris*",
    "The City had Notre-Dame; the Town, the Louvre and the H?tel de Ville; the University, the Sorbonne.--*Paris*",
    "The Town had the markets (Halles); the city, the Hospital; the University, the Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs.--*Paris*",
    "Offences committed by the scholars on the left bank were tried in the law courts on the island, and were punished on the right bank at Montfau?on; unless the rector, feeling the university to be strong and the king weak, intervened; for it was the students' privilege to be hanged on their own grounds.--*Paris*",
    "The greater part of these privileges, it may be noted in passing, and there were some even better than the above, had been extorted from the kings by revolts and mutinies.--*Paris*",
    "It is the course of things from time immemorial; the king only lets go when the people tear away.--*Paris*",
    "There is an old charter which puts the matter naively: apropos of fidelity: ~Civibus fidelitas in reges, quoe tamen aliquoties seditionibus interrypta, multa peperit privileyia~.--*Paris*",
    "In the fifteenth century, the Seine bathed five islands within the walls of Paris: Louviers island, where there were then trees, and where there is no longer anything but wood; l'ile aux Vaches, and l'ile Notre-Dame, both deserted, with the exception of one house, both fiefs of the bishop--in the seventeenth century, a single island was formed out of these two, which was built upon and named l'ile Saint-Louis--, lastly the City, and at its point, the little islet of the cow tender, which was afterwards engulfed beneath the platform of the Pont-Neuf.--*Paris*",
    "The City then had five bridges: three on the right, the Pont Notre-Dame, and the Pont au Change, of stone, the Pont aux Meuniers, of wood; two on the left, the Petit Pont, of stone, the Pont Saint-Michel, of wood; all loaded with houses.--*Paris*",
    "The University had six gates, built by Philip Augustus; there were, beginning with la Tournelle, the Porte Saint- Victor, the Porte Bordelle, the Porte Papale, the Porte Saint- Jacques, the Porte Saint-Michel, the Porte Saint-Germain.--*Paris*",
    "The Town had six gates, built by Charles V.; beginning with the Tour de Billy they were: the Porte Saint-Antoine, the Porte du Temple, the Porte Saint-Martin, the Porte Saint-Denis, the Porte Montmartre, the Porte Saint-Honor\u00e9.--*Paris*",
    "All these gates were strong, and also handsome, which does not detract from strength.--*Paris*",
    "A large, deep moat, with a brisk current during the high water of winter, bathed the base of the wall round Paris; the Seine furnished the water.--*Paris*",
    "At night, the gates were shut, the river was barred at both ends of the city with huge iron chains, and Paris slept tranquilly.--*Paris*",
    "From a bird's-eye view, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and the University, each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of eccentrically tangled streets.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, at first sight, one recognized the fact that these three fragments formed but one body.--*Paris*",
    "One immediately perceived three long parallel streets, unbroken, undisturbed, traversing, almost in a straight line, all three cities, from one end to the other; from North to South, perpendicularly, to the Seine, which bound them together, mingled them, infused them in each other, poured and transfused the people incessantly, from one to the other, and made one out of the three.--*Paris*",
    "The first of these streets ran from the Porte Saint-Martin: it was called the Rue Saint-Jacques in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint-Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and the Pont Notre- Dame.--*Paris*",
    "The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe on the left bank, Rue de la Barilleri\u00e9 in the island, Rue Saint- Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint-Michel on one arm of the Seine, Pont au Change on the other, ran from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University, to the Porte Saint-Denis in the Town.--*Paris*",
    "However, under all these names, there were but two streets, parent streets, generating streets,--the two arteries of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "All the other veins of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them.--*Paris*",
    "Independently of these two principal streets, piercing Paris diametrically in its whole breadth, from side to side, common to the entire capital, the City and the University had also each its own great special street, which ran lengthwise by them, parallel to the Seine, cutting, as it passed, at right angles, the two arterial thoroughfares.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, in the Town, one descended in a straight line from the Porte Saint-Antoine to the Porte Saint-Honor\u00e9; in the University from the Porte Saint-Victor to the Porte Saint-Germain.--*Paris*",
    "These two great thoroughfares intersected by the two first, formed the canvas upon which reposed, knotted and crowded together on every hand, the labyrinthine network of the streets of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "In the incomprehensible plan of these streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two clusters of great streets, like magnified sheaves of grain, one in the University, the other in the Town, which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates.--*Paris*",
    "Some traces of this geometrical plan still exist to-day.--*Paris*",
    "Now, what aspect did this whole present, when, as viewed from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame, in 1482?--*Paris*",
    "That we shall try to describe.--*Paris*",
    "For the spectator who arrived, panting, upon that pinnacle, it was first a dazzling confusing view of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, places, spires, bell towers.--*Paris*",
    "Everything struck your eye at once: the carved gable, the pointed roof, the turrets suspended at the angles of the walls; the stone pyramids of the eleventh century, the slate obelisks of the fifteenth; the round, bare tower of the donjon keep; the square and fretted tower of the church; the great and the little, the massive and the aerial.--*Paris*",
    "The eye was, for a long time, wholly lost in this labyrinth, where there was nothing which did not possess its originality, its reason, its genius, its beauty,--nothing which did not proceed from art; beginning with the smallest house, with its painted and carved front, with external beams, elliptical door, with projecting stories, to the royal Louvre, which then had a colonnade of towers.--*Paris*",
    "But these are the principal masses which were then to be distinguished when the eye began to accustom itself to this tumult of edifices.--*Paris*",
    "In the first place, the City.--\"The island of the City,\" as Sauval says, who, in spite of his confused medley, sometimes has such happy turns of expression,--\"the island of the city is made like a great ship, stuck in the mud and run aground in the current, near the centre of the Seine.\"--*Paris*",
    "We have just explained that, in the fifteenth century, this ship was anchored to the two banks of the river by five bridges.--*Paris*",
    "This form of a ship had also struck the heraldic scribes; for it is from that, and not from the siege by the Normans, that the ship which blazons the old shield of Paris, comes, according to Favyn and Pasquier.--*Paris*",
    "For him who understands how to decipher them, armorial bearings are algebra, armorial bearings have a tongue.--*Paris*",
    "The whole history of the second half of the Middle Ages is written in armorial bearings,--the first half is in the symbolism of the Roman churches.--*Paris*",
    "They are the hieroglyphics of feudalism, succeeding those of theocracy.--*Paris*",
    "Thus the City first presented itself to the eye, with its stern to the east, and its prow to the west.--*Paris*",
    "Turning towards the prow, one had before one an innumerable flock of ancient roofs, over which arched broadly the lead-covered apse of the Sainte-Chapelle, like an elephant's haunches loaded with its tower.--*Paris*",
    "Only here, this tower was the most audacious, the most open, the most ornamented spire of cabinet-maker's work that ever let the sky peep through its cone of lace.--*Paris*",
    "In front of Notre-Dame, and very near at hand, three streets opened into the cathedral square,--a fine square, lined with ancient houses.--*Paris*",
    "Over the south side of this place bent the wrinkled and sullen fa?ade of the H?tel Dieu, and its roof, which seemed covered with warts and pustules.--*Paris*",
    "Then, on the right and the left, to east and west, within that wall of the City, which was yet so contracted, rose the bell towers of its one and twenty churches, of every date, of every form, of every size, from the low and wormeaten belfry of Saint-Denis du Pas (~Carcer Glaueini~) to the slender needles of Saint-Pierre aux Boeufs and Saint-Landry.--*Paris*",
    "Behind Notre-Dame, the cloister and its Gothic galleries spread out towards the north; on the south, the half-Roman palace of the bishop; on the east, the desert point of the Terrain.--*Paris*",
    "In this throng of houses the eye also distinguished, by the lofty open-work mitres of stone which then crowned the roof itself, even the most elevated windows of the palace, the H?tel given by the city, under Charles VI., to Juv\u00e9nal des Ursins; a little farther on, the pitch-covered sheds of the Palus Market; in still another quarter the new apse of Saint- Germain le Vieux, lengthened in 1458, with a bit of the Rue aux Febves; and then, in places, a square crowded with people; a pillory, erected at the corner of a street; a fine fragment of the pavement of Philip Augustus, a magnificent flagging, grooved for the horses' feet, in the middle of the road, and so badly replaced in the sixteenth century by the miserable cobblestones, called the \"pavement of the League;\" a deserted back courtyard, with one of those diaphanous staircase turrets, such as were erected in the fifteenth century, one of which is still to be seen in the Rue des Bourdonnais.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, at the right of the Sainte-Chapelle, towards the west, the Palais de Justice rested its group of towers at the edge of the water.--*Paris*",
    "The thickets of the king's gardens, which covered the western point of the City, masked the Island du Passeur.--*Paris*",
    "As for the water, from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame one hardly saw it, on either side of the City; the Seine was hidden by bridges, the bridges by houses.--*Paris*",
    "And when the glance passed these bridges, whose roofs were visibly green, rendered mouldy before their time by the vapors from the water, if it was directed to the left, towards the University, the first edifice which struck it was a large, low sheaf of towers, the Petit-Ch\u00e0telet, whose yawning gate devoured the end of the Petit-Pont.--*Paris*",
    "Then, if your view ran along the bank, from east to west, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, there was a long cordon of houses, with carved beams, stained-glass windows, each story projecting over that beneath it, an interminable zigzag of bourgeois gables, frequently interrupted by the mouth of a street, and from time to time also by the front or angle of a huge stone mansion, planted at its ease, with courts and gardens, wings and detached buildings, amid this populace of crowded and narrow houses, like a grand gentleman among a throng of rustics.--*Paris*",
    "There were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of Lorraine, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining the Tournelle, to the H?tel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended Paris, and whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the year, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of the setting sun.--*Paris*",
    "This side of the Seine was, however, the least mercantile of the two.--*Paris*",
    "Students furnished more of a crowd and more noise there than artisans, and there was not, properly speaking, any quay, except from the Pont Saint-Michel to the Tour de Nesle.--*Paris*",
    "The rest of the bank of the Seine was now a naked strand, the same as beyond the Bernardins; again, a throng of houses, standing with their feet in the water, as between the two bridges.--*Paris*",
    "There was a great uproar of laundresses; they screamed, and talked, and sang from morning till night along the beach, and beat a great deal of linen there, just as in our day.--*Paris*",
    "This is not the least of the gayeties of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "The University presented a dense mass to the eye.--*Paris*",
    "From one end to the other, it was homogeneous and compact.--*Paris*",
    "The thousand roofs, dense, angular, clinging to each other, composed, nearly all, of the same geometrical element, offered, when viewed from above, the aspect of a crystallization of the same substance.--*Paris*",
    "The capricious ravine of streets did not cut this block of houses into too disproportionate slices.--*Paris*",
    "The forty-two colleges were scattered about in a fairly equal manner, and there were some everywhere.--*Paris*",
    "The amusingly varied crests of these beautiful edifices were the product of the same art as the simple roofs which they overshot, and were, actually, only a multiplication of the square or the cube of the same geometrical figure.--*Paris*",
    "Hence they complicated the whole effect, without disturbing it; completed, without overloading it.--*Paris*",
    "Geometry is harmony.--*Paris*",
    "Some fine mansions here and there made magnificent outlines against the picturesque attics of the left bank.--*Paris*",
    "The house of Nevers, the house of Rome, the house of Reims, which have disappeared; the H?tel de Cluny, which still exists, for the consolation of the artist, and whose tower was so stupidly deprived of its crown a few years ago.--*Paris*",
    "Close to Cluny, that Roman palace, with fine round arches, were once the hot baths of Julian.--*Paris*",
    "There were a great many abbeys, of a beauty more devout, of a grandeur more solemn than the mansions, but not less beautiful, not less grand.--*Paris*",
    "Those which first caught the eye were the Bernardins, with their three bell towers; Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, whose square tower, which still exists, makes us regret the rest; the Sorbonne, half college, half monastery, of which so admirable a nave survives; the fine quadrilateral cloister of the Mathurins; its neighbor, the cloister of Saint-Benoit, within whose walls they have had time to cobble up a theatre, between the seventh and eighth editions of this book; the Cordeliers, with their three enormous adjacent gables; the Augustins, whose graceful spire formed, after the Tour de Nesle, the second denticulation on this side of Paris, starting from the west.--*Paris*",
    "The colleges, which are, in fact, the intermediate ring between the cloister and the world, hold the middle position in the monumental series between the H?tels and the abbeys, with a severity full of elegance, sculpture less giddy than the palaces, an architecture less severe than the convents.--*Paris*",
    "Unfortunately, hardly anything remains of these monuments, where Gothic art combined with so just a balance, richness and economy.--*Paris*",
    "The churches (and they were numerous and splendid in the University, and they were graded there also in all the ages of architecture, from the round arches of Saint-Julian to the pointed arches of Saint-S\u00e9verin), the churches dominated the whole; and, like one harmony more in this mass of harmonies, they pierced in quick succession the multiple open work of the gables with slashed spires, with open-work bell towers, with slender pinnacles, whose line was also only a magnificent exaggeration of the acute angle of the roofs.--*Paris*",
    "The ground of the University was hilly; Mount Sainte- Genevi\u00e8ve formed an enormous mound to the south; and it was a sight to see from the summit of Notre-Dame how that throng of narrow and tortuous streets (to-day the Latin Quarter), those bunches of houses which, spread out in every direction from the top of this eminence, precipitated themselves in disorder, and almost perpendicularly down its flanks, nearly to the water's edge, having the air, some of falling, others of clambering up again, and all of holding to one another.--*Paris*",
    "A continual flux of a thousand black points which passed each other on the pavements made everything move before the eyes; it was the populace seen thus from aloft and afar.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, in the intervals of these roofs, of these spires, of these accidents of numberless edifices, which bent and writhed, and jagged in so eccentric a manner the extreme line of the University, one caught a glimpse, here and there, of a great expanse of moss-grown wall, a thick, round tower, a crenellated city gate, shadowing forth the fortress; it was the wall of Philip Augustus.--*Paris*",
    "Beyond, the fields gleamed green; beyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban houses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant.--*Paris*",
    "Some of these faubourgs were important: there were, first, starting from la Tournelle, the Bourg Saint-Victor, with its one arch bridge over the Bi\u00e8vre, its abbey where one could read the epitaph of Louis le Gros, ~epitaphium Ludovici Grossi~, and its church with an octagonal spire, flanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century (a similar one can be seen at Etampes; it is not yet destroyed); next, the Bourg Saint- Marceau, which already had three churches and one convent; then, leaving the mill of the Gobelins and its four white walls on the left, there was the Faubourg Saint-Jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square; the church of Saint- Jacques du Haut-Pas, which was then Gothic, pointed, charming; Saint-Magloire, a fine nave of the fourteenth century, which Napoleon turned into a hayloft; Notre-Dame des Champs, where there were Byzantine mosaics; lastly, after having left behind, full in the country, the Monastery des Chartreux, a rich edifice contemporary with the Palais de Justice, with its little garden divided into compartments, and the haunted ruins of Vauvert, the eye fell, to the west, upon the three Roman spires of Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s.--*Paris*",
    "The Bourg Saint-Germain, already a large community, formed fifteen or twenty streets in the rear; the pointed bell tower of Saint- Sulpice marked one corner of the town.--*Paris*",
    "Close beside it one descried the quadrilateral enclosure of the fair of Saint- Germain, where the market is situated to-day; then the abbot's pillory, a pretty little round tower, well capped with a leaden cone; the brickyard was further on, and the Rue du Four, which led to the common bakehouse, and the mill on its hillock, and the lazar house, a tiny house, isolated and half seen.--*Paris*",
    "But that which attracted the eye most of all, and fixed it for a long time on that point, was the abbey itself.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that this monastery, which had a grand air, both as a church and as a seignory; that abbatial palace, where the bishops of Paris counted themselves happy if they could pass the night; that refectory, upon which the architect had bestowed the air, the beauty, and the rose window of a cathedral; that elegant chapel of the Virgin; that monumental dormitory; those vast gardens; that portcullis; that drawbridge; that envelope of battlements which notched to the eye the verdure of the surrounding meadows; those courtyards, where gleamed men at arms, intermingled with golden copes;--the whole grouped and clustered about three lofty spires, with round arches, well planted upon a Gothic apse, made a magnificent figure against the horizon.--*Paris*",
    "When, at length, after having contemplated the University for a long time, you turned towards the right bank, towards the Town, the character of the spectacle was abruptly altered.--*Paris*",
    "The Town, in fact much larger than the University, was also less of a unit.--*Paris*",
    "At the first glance, one saw that it was divided into many masses, singularly distinct.--*Paris*",
    "First, to the eastward, in that part of the town which still takes its name from the marsh where Camulog\u00e8nes entangled Caesar, was a pile of palaces.--*Paris*",
    "The block extended to the very water's edge.--*Paris*",
    "Four almost contiguous H?tels, Jouy, Sens, Barbeau, the house of the Queen, mirrored their slate peaks, broken with slender turrets, in the Seine.--*Paris*",
    "These four edifices filled the space from the Rue des Nonaindi\u00e8res, to the abbey of the Celestins, whose spire gracefully relieved their line of gables and battlements.--*Paris*",
    "A few miserable, greenish hovels, hanging over the water in front of these sumptuous H?tels, did not prevent one from seeing the fine angles of their fa?ades, their large, square windows with stone mullions, their pointed porches overloaded with statues, the vivid outlines of their walls, always clear cut, and all those charming accidents of architecture, which cause Gothic art to have the air of beginning its combinations afresh with every monument.--*Paris*",
    "Behind these palaces, extended in all directions, now broken, fenced in, battlemented like a citadel, now veiled by great trees like a Carthusian convent, the immense and multiform enclosure of that miraculous H?tel de Saint-Pol, where the King of France possessed the means of lodging superbly two and twenty princes of the rank of the dauphin and the Duke of Burgundy, with their domestics and their suites, without counting the great lords, and the emperor when he came to view Paris, and the lions, who had their separate H?tel at the royal H?tel.--*Paris*",
    "Let us say here that a prince's apartment was then composed of never less than eleven large rooms, from the chamber of state to the oratory, not to mention the galleries, baths, vapor-baths, and other \"superfluous places,\" with which each apartment was provided; not to mention the private gardens for each of the king's guests; not to mention the kitchens, the cellars, the domestic offices, the general refectories of the house, the poultry-yards, where there were twenty-two general laboratories, from the bakehouses to the wine-cellars; games of a thousand sorts, malls, tennis, and riding at the ring; aviaries, fishponds, menageries, stables, barns, libraries, arsenals and foundries.--*Paris*",
    "This was what a king's palace, a Louvre, a H?tel de Saint-Pol was then.--*Paris*",
    "A city within a city.--*Paris*",
    "From the tower where we are placed, the H?tel Saint-Pol, almost half hidden by the four great houses of which we have just spoken, was still very considerable and very marvellous to see.--*Paris*",
    "One could there distinguish, very well, though cleverly united with the principal building by long galleries, decked with painted glass and slender columns, the three H?tels which Charles V. had amalgamated with his palace: the H?tel du Petit-Muce, with the airy balustrade, which formed a graceful border to its roof; the H?tel of the Abbe de Saint-Maur, having the vanity of a stronghold, a great tower, machicolations, loopholes, iron gratings, and over the large Saxon door, the armorial bearings of the abb\u00e9, between the two mortises of the drawbridge; the H?tel of the Comte d' Etampes, whose donjon keep, ruined at its summit, was rounded and notched like a cock's comb; here and there, three or four ancient oaks, forming a tuft together like enormous cauliflowers; gambols of swans, in the clear water of the fishponds, all in folds of light and shade; many courtyards of which one beheld picturesque bits; the H?tel of the Lions, with its low, pointed arches on short, Saxon pillars, its iron gratings and its perpetual roar; shooting up above the whole, the scale- ornamented spire of the Ave-Maria; on the left, the house of the Provost of Paris, flanked by four small towers, delicately grooved, in the middle; at the extremity, the H?tel Saint-Pol, properly speaking, with its multiplied fa?ades, its successive enrichments from the time of Charles V., the hybrid excrescences, with which the fancy of the architects had loaded it during the last two centuries, with all the apses of its chapels, all the gables of its galleries, a thousand weathercocks for the four winds, and its two lofty contiguous towers, whose conical roof, surrounded by battlements at its base, looked like those pointed caps which have their edges turned up.--*Paris*",
    "Continuing to mount the stories of this amphitheatre of palaces spread out afar upon the ground, after crossing a deep ravine hollowed out of the roofs in the Town, which marked the passage of the Rue Saint-Antoine, the eye reached the house of Angoul\u00eame, a vast construction of many epochs, where there were perfectly new and very white parts, which melted no better into the whole than a red patch on a blue doublet.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern palace, bristling with carved eaves, covered with sheets of lead, where coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze, that roof, so curiously damascened, darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice; whose huge and ancient towers, rounded by age like casks, sinking together with old age, and rending themselves from top to bottom, resembled great bellies unbuttoned.--*Paris*",
    "Behind rose the forest of spires of the Palais des Tournelles.--*Paris*",
    "Not a view in the world, either at Chambord or at the Alhambra, is more magic, more aerial, more enchanting, than that thicket of spires, tiny bell towers, chimneys, weather-vanes, winding staircases, lanterns through which the daylight makes its way, which seem cut out at a blow, pavilions, spindle-shaped turrets, or, as they were then called, \"tournelles,\" all differing in form, in height, and attitude.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced it a gigantic stone chess-board.--*Paris*",
    "To the right of the Tournelles, that truss of enormous towers, black as ink, running into each other and tied, as it were, by a circular moat; that donjon keep, much more pierced with loopholes than with windows; that drawbridge, always raised; that portcullis, always lowered,--is the Bastille.--*Paris*",
    "Those sorts of black beaks which project from between the battlements, and which you take from a distance to be cave spouts, are cannons.--*Paris*",
    "Beneath them, at the foot of the formidable edifice, behold the Porte Sainte-Antoine, buried between its two towers.--*Paris*",
    "Beyond the Tournelles, as far as the wall of Charles V., spread out, with rich compartments of verdure and of flowers, a velvet carpet of cultivated land and royal parks, in the midst of which one recognized, by its labyrinth of trees and alleys, the famous Daedalus garden which Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "had given to Coictier.--*Paris*",
    "The doctor's observatory rose above the labyrinth like a great isolated column, with a tiny house for a capital.--*Paris*",
    "Terrible astrologies took place in that laboratory.--*Paris*",
    "There to-day is the Place Royale.--*Paris*",
    "As we have just said, the quarter of the palace, of which we have just endeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief points, filled the angle which Charles V.'s wall made with the Seine on the east.--*Paris*",
    "The centre of the Town was occupied by a pile of houses for the populace.--*Paris*",
    "It was there, in fact, that the three bridges disgorged upon the right bank, and bridges lead to the building of houses rather than palaces.--*Paris*",
    "That congregation of bourgeois habitations, pressed together like the cells in a hive, had a beauty of its own.--*Paris*",
    "It is with the roofs of a capital as with the waves of the sea,--they are grand.--*Paris*",
    "First the streets, crossed and entangled, forming a hundred amusing figures in the block; around the market-place, it was like a star with a thousand rays.--*Paris*",
    "The Rues Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, with their innumerable ramifications, rose one after the other, like trees intertwining their branches; and then the tortuous lines, the Rues de la Platrerie, de la Verrerie, de la Tixeranderie, etc., meandered over all.--*Paris*",
    "There were also fine edifices which pierced the petrified undulations of that sea of gables.--*Paris*",
    "At the head of the Pont aux Changeurs, behind which one beheld the Seine foaming beneath the wheels of the Pont aux Meuniers, there was the Chalelet, no longer a Roman tower, as under Julian the Apostate, but a feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that the pickaxe could not break away so much as the thickness of the fist in a space of three hours; there was the rich square bell tower of Saint- Jacques de la Boucherie, with its angles all frothing with carvings, already admirable, although it was not finished in the fifteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "With these two quarters, one of H?tels, the other of houses, the third feature of aspect presented by the city was a long zone of abbeys, which bordered it in nearly the whole of its circumference, from the rising to the setting sun, and, behind the circle of fortifications which hemmed in Paris, formed a second interior enclosure of convents and chapels.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, immediately adjoining the park des Tournelles, between the Rue Saint-Antoine and the Vielle Rue du Temple, there stood Sainte-Catherine, with its immense cultivated lands, which were terminated only by the wall of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Between the old and the new Rue du Temple, there was the Temple, a sinister group of towers, lofty, erect, and isolated in the middle of a vast, battlemented enclosure.--*Paris*",
    "Between the Rue Neuve-du- Temple and the Rue Saint-Martin, there was the Abbey of Saint-Martin, in the midst of its gardens, a superb fortified church, whose girdle of towers, whose diadem of bell towers, yielded in force and splendor only to Saint-Germain des Pr\u00e9s.--*Paris*",
    "Between the Rue Saint-Martin and the Rue Saint- Denis, spread the enclosure of the Trinit\u00e9.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, between the Rue Saint-Denis, and the Rue Montorgueil, stood the Filles-Dieu.--*Paris*",
    "On one side, the rotting roofs and unpaved enclosure of the Cour des Miracles could be descried.--*Paris*",
    "It was the sole profane ring which was linked to that devout chain of convents.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, the fourth compartment, which stretched itself out in the agglomeration of the roofs on the right bank, and which occupied the western angle of the enclosure, and the banks of the river down stream, was a fresh cluster of palaces and H?tels pressed close about the base of the Louvre.--*Paris*",
    "The old Louvre of Philip Augustus, that immense edifice whose great tower rallied about it three and twenty chief towers, not to reckon the lesser towers, seemed from a distance to be enshrined in the Gothic roofs of the H?tel d'Alen?on, and the Petit-Bourbon.--*Paris*",
    "This hydra of towers, giant guardian of Paris, with its four and twenty heads, always erect, with its monstrous haunches, loaded or scaled with slates, and all streaming with metallic reflections, terminated with wonderful effect the configuration of the Town towards the west.--*Paris*",
    "Thus an immense block, which the Romans called ~iusula~, or island, of bourgeois houses, flanked on the right and the left by two blocks of palaces, crowned, the one by the Louvre, the other by the Tournelles, bordered on the north by a long girdle of abbeys and cultivated enclosures, all amalgamated and melted together in one view; upon these thousands of edifices, whose tiled and slated roofs outlined upon each other so many fantastic chains, the bell towers, tattooed, fluted, and ornamented with twisted bands, of the four and forty churches on the right bank; myriads of cross streets; for boundary on one side, an enclosure of lofty walls with square towers (that of the University had round towers); on the other, the Seine, cut by bridges, and bearing on its bosom a multitude of boats; behold the Town of Paris in the fifteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "Beyond the walls, several suburban villages pressed close about the gates, but less numerous and more scattered than those of the University.--*Paris*",
    "Behind the Bastille there were twenty hovels clustered round the curious sculptures of the Croix-Faubin and the flying buttresses of the Abbey of Saint- Antoine des Champs; then Popincourt, lost amid wheat fields; then la Courtille, a merry village of wine-shops; the hamlet of Saint-Laurent with its church whose bell tower, from afar, seemed to add itself to the pointed towers of the Porte Saint- Martin; the Faubourg Saint-Denis, with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; beyond the Montmartre Gate, the Grange- Bateli\u00e8re, encircled with white walls; behind it, with its chalky slopes, Montmartre, which had then almost as many churches as windmills, and which has kept only the windmills, for society no longer demands anything but bread for the body.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, beyond the Louvre, the Faubourg Saint- Honor\u00e9, already considerable at that time, could be seen stretching away into the fields, and Petit-Bretagne gleaming green, and the March\u00e9 aux Pourceaux spreading abroad, in whose centre swelled the horrible apparatus used for boiling counterfeiters.--*Paris*",
    "Between la Courtille and Saint-Laurent, your eye had already noticed, on the summit of an eminence crouching amid desert plains, a sort of edifice which resembled from a distance a ruined colonnade, mounted upon a basement with its foundation laid bare.--*Paris*",
    "This was neither a Parthenon, nor a temple of the Olympian Jupiter.--*Paris*",
    "It was Montfau?on.--*Paris*",
    "Now, if the enumeration of so many edifices, summary as we have endeavored to make it, has not shattered in the reader's mind the general image of old Paris, as we have constructed it, we will recapitulate it in a few words.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre, the island of the City, resembling as to form an enormous tortoise, and throwing out its bridges with tiles for scales; like legs from beneath its gray shell of roofs.--*Paris*",
    "On the left, the monolithic trapezium, firm, dense, bristling, of the University; on the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, much more intermixed with gardens and monuments.--*Paris*",
    "The three blocks, city, university, and town, marbled with innumerable streets.--*Paris*",
    "Across all, the Seine, \"foster-mother Seine,\" as says Father Du Breul, blocked with islands, bridges, and boats.--*Paris*",
    "All about an immense plain, patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages.--*Paris*",
    "On the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, Montrouge, Gentilly, with its round tower and its square tower, etc.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, Voltaire said of this city, that \"before Louis XIV., it possessed but four fine monuments\": the dome of the Sorbonne, the Val-de-Grace, the modern Louvre, and I know not what the fourth was--the Luxembourg, perhaps.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately, Voltaire was the author of \"Candide\" in spite of this, and in spite of this, he is, among all the men who have followed each other in the long series of humanity, the one who has best possessed the diabolical laugh.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, this proves that one can be a fine genius, and yet understand nothing of an art to which one does not belong.--*Paris*",
    "Did not Moliere imagine that he was doing Raphael and Michael-Angelo a very great honor, by calling them \"those Mignards of their age?\"--*Paris*",
    "Let us return to Paris and to the fifteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "It was not then merely a handsome city; it was a homogeneous city, an architectural and historical product of the Middle Ages, a chronicle in stone.--*Paris*",
    "It was a city formed of two layers only; the Romanesque layer and the Gothic layer; for the Roman layer had disappeared long before, with the exception of the Hot Baths of Julian, where it still pierced through the thick crust of the Middle Ages.--*Paris*",
    "As for the Celtic layer, no specimens were any longer to be found, even when sinking wells.--*Paris*",
    "Fifty years later, when the Renaissance began to mingle with this unity which was so severe and yet so varied, the dazzling luxury of its fantasies and systems, its debasements of Roman round arches, Greek columns, and Gothic bases, its sculpture which was so tender and so ideal, its peculiar taste for arabesques and acanthus leaves, its architectural paganism, contemporary with Luther, Paris, was perhaps, still more beautiful, although less harmonious to the eye, and to the thought.--*Paris*",
    "But this splendid moment lasted only for a short time; the Renaissance was not impartial; it did not content itself with building, it wished to destroy; it is true that it required the room.--*Paris*",
    "Thus Gothic Paris was complete only for a moment.--*Paris*",
    "Saint- Jacques de la Boucherie had barely been completed when the demolition of the old Louvre was begun.--*Paris*",
    "After that, the great city became more disfigured every day.--*Paris*",
    "Gothic Paris, beneath which Roman Paris was effaced, was effaced in its turn; but can any one say what Paris has replaced it?--*Paris*",
    "There is the Paris of Catherine de Medicis at the Tuileries;*--the Paris of Henri II., at the H?tel de Ville, two edifices still in fine taste;--the Paris of Henri IV., at the Place Royale: fa?ades of brick with stone corners, and slated roofs, tri-colored houses;--the Paris of Louis XIII., at the Val-de- Grace: a crushed and squat architecture, with vaults like basket-handles, and something indescribably pot-bellied in the column, and thickset in the dome;--the Paris of Louis XIV., in the Invalides: grand, rich, gilded, cold;--the Paris of Louis XV., in Saint-Sulpice: volutes, knots of ribbon, clouds, vermicelli and chiccory leaves, all in stone;--the Paris of Louis XVI., in the Pantheon: Saint Peter of Rome, badly copied (the edifice is awkwardly heaped together, which has not amended its lines);--the Paris of the Republic, in the School of Medicine: a poor Greek and Roman taste, which resembles the Coliseum or the Parthenon as the constitution of the year III., resembles the laws of Minos,--it is called in architecture, \"the Messidor\"** taste;--the Paris of Napoleon in the Place Vendome: this one is sublime, a column of bronze made of cannons;--the Paris of the Restoration, at the Bourse: a very white colonnade supporting a very smooth frieze; the whole is square and cost twenty millions.--*Paris*",
    "To each of these characteristic monuments there is attached by a similarity of taste, fashion, and attitude, a certain number of houses scattered about in different quarters and which the eyes of the connoisseur easily distinguishes and furnishes with a date.--*Paris*",
    "When one knows how to look, one finds the spirit of a century, and the physiognomy of a king, even in the knocker on a door.--*Paris*",
    "The Paris of the present day has then, no general physiognomy.--*Paris*",
    "It is a collection of specimens of many centuries, and the finest have disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "The capital grows only in houses, and what houses!--*Paris*",
    "At the rate at which Paris is now proceeding, it will renew itself every fifty years.--*Paris*",
    "Thus the historical significance of its architecture is being effaced every day.--*Paris*",
    "Monuments are becoming rarer and rarer, and one seems to see them gradually engulfed, by the flood of houses.--*Paris*",
    "Our fathers had a Paris of stone; our sons will have one of plaster.--*Paris*",
    "So far as the modern monuments of new Paris are concerned, we would gladly be excused from mentioning them.--*Paris*",
    "It is not that we do not admire them as they deserve.--*Paris*",
    "The Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve of M. Soufflot is certainly the finest Savoy cake that has ever been made in stone.--*Paris*",
    "The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a very distinguished bit of pastry.--*Paris*",
    "The dome of the wheat market is an English jockey cap, on a grand scale.--*Paris*",
    "The towers of Saint-Sulpice are two huge clarinets, and the form is as good as any other; the telegraph, contorted and grimacing, forms an admirable accident upon their roofs.--*Paris*",
    "Saint-Roch has a door which, for magnificence, is comparable only to that of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin.--*Paris*",
    "It has, also, a crucifixion in high relief, in a cellar, with a sun of gilded wood.--*Paris*",
    "These things are fairly marvellous.--*Paris*",
    "The lantern of the labyrinth of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious.--*Paris*",
    "As for the Palace of the Bourse, which is Greek as to its colonnade, Roman in the round arches of its doors and windows, of the Renaissance by virtue of its flattened vault, it is indubitably a very correct and very pure monument; the proof is that it is crowned with an attic, such as was never seen in Athens, a beautiful, straight line, gracefully broken here and there by stovepipes.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that if it is according to rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its purpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent from the mere aspect of the building, one cannot be too much amazed at a structure which might be indifferently--the palace of a king, a chamber of communes, a town-hall, a college, a riding-school, an academy, a warehouse, a court-house, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple, or a theatre.--*Paris*",
    "However, it is an Exchange.--*Paris*",
    "An edifice ought to be, moreover, suitable to the climate.--*Paris*",
    "This one is evidently constructed expressly for our cold and rainy skies.--*Paris*",
    "It has a roof almost as flat as roofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it snows; and of course roofs are made to be swept.--*Paris*",
    "As for its purpose, of which we just spoke, it fulfils it to a marvel; it is a bourse in France as it would have been a temple in Greece.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that the architect was at a good deal of trouble to conceal the clock face, which would have destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the fa?ade; but, on the other hand, we have that colonnade which circles round the edifice and under which, on days of high religious ceremony, the theories of the stock-brokers and the courtiers of commerce can be developed so majestically.--*Paris*",
    "These are very superb structures.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add a quantity of fine, amusing, and varied streets, like the Rue de Rivoli, and I do not despair of Paris presenting to the eye, when viewed from a balloon, that richness of line, that opulence of detail, that diversity of aspect, that grandiose something in the simple, and unexpected in the beautiful, which characterizes a checker-board.--*Paris*",
    "However, admirable as the Paris of to-day may seem to you, reconstruct the Paris of the fifteenth century, call it up before you in thought; look at the sky athwart that surprising forest of spires, towers, and belfries; spread out in the centre of the city, tear away at the point of the islands, fold at the arches of the bridges, the Seine, with its broad green and yellow expanses, more variable than the skin of a serpent; project clearly against an azure horizon the Gothic profile of this ancient Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Make its contour float in a winter's mist which clings to its numerous chimneys; drown it in profound night and watch the odd play of lights and shadows in that sombre labyrinth of edifices; cast upon it a ray of light which shall vaguely outline it and cause to emerge from the fog the great heads of the towers; or take that black silhouette again, enliven with shadow the thousand acute angles of the spires and gables, and make it start out more toothed than a shark's jaw against a copper-colored western sky,--and then compare.--*Paris*",
    "And if you wish to receive of the ancient city an impression with which the modern one can no longer furnish you, climb--on the morning of some grand festival, beneath the rising sun of Easter or of Pentecost--climb upon some elevated point, whence you command the entire capital; and be present at the wakening of the chimes.--*Paris*",
    "Behold, at a signal given from heaven, for it is the sun which gives it, all those churches quiver simultaneously.--*Paris*",
    "First come scattered strokes, running from one church to another, as when musicians give warning that they are about to begin.--*Paris*",
    "Then, all at once, behold!--for it seems at times, as though the ear also possessed a sight of its own,--behold, rising from each bell tower, something like a column of sound, a cloud of harmony.--*Paris*",
    "First, the vibration of each bell mounts straight upwards, pure and, so to speak, isolated from the others, into the splendid morning sky; then, little by little, as they swell they melt together, mingle, are lost in each other, and amalgamate in a magnificent concert.--*Paris*",
    "It is no longer anything but a mass of sonorous vibrations incessantly sent forth from the numerous belfries; floats, undulates, bounds, whirls over the city, and prolongs far beyond the horizon the deafening circle of its oscillations.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, this sea of harmony is not a chaos; great and profound as it is, it has not lost its transparency; you behold the windings of each group of notes which escapes from the belfries.--*Paris*",
    "You can follow the dialogue, by turns grave and shrill, of the treble and the bass; you can see the octaves leap from one tower to another; you watch them spring forth, winged, light, and whistling, from the silver bell, to fall, broken and limping from the bell of wood; you admire in their midst the rich gamut which incessantly ascends and re-ascends the seven bells of Saint-Eustache; you see light and rapid notes running across it, executing three or four luminous zigzags, and vanishing like flashes of lightning.--*Paris*",
    "Yonder is the Abbey of Saint-Martin, a shrill, cracked singer; here the gruff and gloomy voice of the Bastille; at the other end, the great tower of the Louvre, with its bass.--*Paris*",
    "The royal chime of the palace scatters on all sides, and without relaxation, resplendent trills, upon which fall, at regular intervals, the heavy strokes from the belfry of Notre-Dame, which makes them sparkle like the anvil under the hammer.--*Paris*",
    "At intervals you behold the passage of sounds of all forms which come from the triple peal of Saint-Germaine des Pr\u00e9s.--*Paris*",
    "Then, again, from time to time, this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage to the beats of the Ave Maria, which bursts forth and sparkles like an aigrette of stars.--*Paris*",
    "Below, in the very depths of the concert, you confusedly distinguish the interior chanting of the churches, which exhales through the vibrating pores of their vaulted roofs.--*Paris*",
    "Assuredly, this is an opera which it is worth the trouble of listening to.--*Paris*",
    "Ordinarily, the noise which escapes from Paris by day is the city speaking; by night, it is the city breathing; in this case, it is the city singing.--*Paris*",
    "Lend an ear, then, to this concert of bell towers; spread over all the murmur of half a million men, the eternal plaint of the river, the infinite breathings of the wind, the grave and distant quartette of the four forests arranged upon the hills, on the horizon, like immense stacks of organ pipes; extinguish, as in a half shade, all that is too hoarse and too shrill about the central chime, and say whether you know anything in the world more rich and joyful, more golden, more dazzling, than this tumult of bells and chimes;--than this furnace of music,--than these ten thousand brazen voices chanting simultaneously in the flutes of stone, three hundred feet high,--than this city which is no longer anything but an orchestra,--than this symphony which produces the noise of a tempest.--*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 1 Good Souls--*Paris*",
    "Sixteen years previous to the epoch when this story takes place, one fine morning, on Quasimodo Sunday, a living creature had been deposited, after mass, in the church of Notre- Dame, on the wooden bed securely fixed in the vestibule on the left, opposite that great image of Saint Christopher, which the figure of Messire Antoine des Essarts, chevalier, carved in stone, had been gazing at on his knees since 1413, when they took it into their heads to overthrow the saint and the faithful follower.--*Paris*",
    "Upon this bed of wood it was customary to expose foundlings for public charity.--*Paris*",
    "Whoever cared to take them did so.--*Paris*",
    "In front of the wooden bed was a copper basin for alms.--*Paris*",
    "The sort of living being which lay upon that plank on the morning of Quasimodo, in the year of the Lord, 1467, appeared to excite to a high degree, the curiosity of the numerous group which had congregated about the wooden bed.--*Paris*",
    "The group was formed for the most part of the fair sex.--*Paris*",
    "Hardly any one was there except old women.--*Paris*",
    "In the first row, and among those who were most bent over the bed, four were noticeable, who, from their gray ~cagoule~, a sort of cassock, were recognizable as attached to some devout sisterhood.--*Paris*",
    "I do not see why history has not transmitted to posterity the names of these four discreet and venerable damsels.--*Paris*",
    "They were Agnes la Herme, Jehanne de la Tarme, Henriette la Gaulti\u00e8re, Gauch\u00e8re la Violette, all four widows, all four dames of the Chapel Etienne Haudry, who had quitted their house with the permission of their mistress, and in conformity with the statutes of Pierre d'Ailly, in order to come and hear the sermon.--*Paris*",
    "However, if these good Haudriettes were, for the moment, complying with the statutes of Pierre d'Ailly, they certainly violated with joy those of Michel de Brache, and the Cardinal of Pisa, which so inhumanly enjoined silence upon them.--*Paris*",
    "The \"little monster\" we should find it difficult ourselves to describe him otherwise, was, in fact, not a new-born child.--*Paris*",
    "It was a very angular and very lively little mass, imprisoned in its linen sack, stamped with the cipher of Messire Guillaume Chartier, then bishop of Paris, with a head projecting.--*Paris*",
    "That head was deformed enough; one beheld only a forest of red hair, one eye, a mouth, and teeth.--*Paris*",
    "The eye wept, the mouth cried, and the teeth seemed to ask only to be allowed to bite.--*Paris*",
    "The whole struggled in the sack, to the great consternation of the crowd, which increased and was renewed incessantly around it.--*Paris*",
    "Dame Aloise de Gondelaurier, a rich and noble woman, who held by the hand a pretty girl about five or six years of age, and dragged a long veil about, suspended to the golden horn of her headdress, halted as she passed the wooden bed, and gazed for a moment at the wretched creature, while her charming little daughter, Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier, spelled out with her tiny, pretty finger, the permanent inscription attached to the wooden bed: \"Foundlings.\"--*Paris*",
    "She turned her back, throwing into the basin a silver florin, which rang among the liards, and made the poor goodwives of the chapel of Etienne Haudry open their eyes.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, the grave and learned Robert Mistricolle, the king's protonotary, passed, with an enormous missal under one arm and his wife on the other (Damoiselle Guillemette la Mairesse), having thus by his side his two regulators,--spiritual and temporal.--*Paris*",
    "For several minutes, a young priest had been listening to the reasoning of the Haudriettes and the sentences of the notary.--*Paris*",
    "He had a severe face, with a large brow, a profound glance.--*Paris*",
    "He thrust the crowd silently aside, scrutinized the \"little magician,\" and stretched out his hand upon him.--*Paris*",
    "It was high time, for all the devotees were already licking their chops over the \"fine, flaming fagot.\"--*Paris*",
    "He took it in his cassock and carried it off.--*Paris*",
    "The spectators followed him with frightened glances.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, he had disappeared through the \"Red Door,\" which then led from the church to the cloister.--*Paris*",
    "When the first surprise was over, Jehanne de la Tarme bent down to the ear of la Gaulti\u00e8re,----*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 2 Claude Frollo--*Paris*",
    "In fact, Claude Frollo was no common person.--*Paris*",
    "He belonged to one of those middle-class families which were called indifferently, in the impertinent language of the last century, the high ~bourgeoise~ or the petty nobility.--*Paris*",
    "This family had inherited from the brothers Paclet the fief of Tirechappe, which was dependent upon the Bishop of Paris, and whose twenty-one houses had been in the thirteenth century the object of so many suits before the official.--*Paris*",
    "As possessor of this fief, Claude Frollo was one of the twenty-seven seigneurs keeping claim to a manor in fee in Paris and its suburbs; and for a long time, his name was to be seen inscribed in this quality, between the H?tel de Tancarville, belonging to Master Fran?ois Le Rez, and the college of Tours, in the records deposited at Saint Martin des Champs.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo had been destined from infancy, by his parents, to the ecclesiastical profession.--*Paris*",
    "He had been taught to read in Latin; he had been trained to keep his eyes on the ground and to speak low.--*Paris*",
    "While still a child, his father had cloistered him in the college of Torchi in the University.--*Paris*",
    "There it was that he had grown up, on the missal and the lexicon.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he was a sad, grave, serious child, who studied ardently, and learned quickly; he never uttered a loud cry in recreation hour, mixed but little in the bacchanals of the Rue du Fouarre, did not know what it was to ~dare alapas et capillos laniare~, and had cut no figure in that revolt of 1463, which the annalists register gravely, under the title of \"The sixth trouble of the University.\"--*Paris*",
    "He seldom rallied the poor students of Montaigu on the ~cappettes~ from which they derived their name, or the bursars of the college of Dormans on their shaved tonsure, and their surtout parti-colored of bluish-green, blue, and violet cloth, ~azurini coloris et bruni~, as says the charter of the Cardinal des Quatre-Couronnes.--*Paris*",
    "On the other hand, he was assiduous at the great and the small schools of the Rue Saint Jean de Beauvais.--*Paris*",
    "The first pupil whom the Abb\u00e9 de Saint Pierre de Val, at the moment of beginning his reading on canon law, always perceived, glued to a pillar of the school Saint-Vendregesile, opposite his rostrum, was Claude Frollo, armed with his horn ink-bottle, biting his pen, scribbling on his threadbare knee, and, in winter, blowing on his fingers.--*Paris*",
    "The first auditor whom Messire Miles d'Isliers, doctor in decretals, saw arrive every Monday morning, all breathless, at the opening of the gates of the school of the Chef-Saint-Denis, was Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, at sixteen years of age, the young clerk might have held his own, in mystical theology, against a father of the church; in canonical theology, against a father of the councils; in scholastic theology, against a doctor of Sorbonne.--*Paris*",
    "Theology conquered, he had plunged into decretals.--*Paris*",
    "From the \"Master of Sentences,\" he had passed to the \"Capitularies of Charlemagne;\" and he had devoured in succession, in his appetite for science, decretals upon decretals, those of Theodore, Bishop of Hispalus; those of Bouchard, Bishop of Worms; those of Yves, Bishop of Chartres; next the decretal of Gratian, which succeeded the capitularies of Charlemagne; then the collection of Gregory IX.--*Paris*",
    "Decretals digested, he flung himself upon medicine, on the liberal arts.--*Paris*",
    "He studied the science of herbs, the science of unguents; he became an expert in fevers and in contusions, in sprains and abcesses.--*Paris*",
    "Jacques d' Espars would have received him as a physician; Richard Hellain, as a surgeon.--*Paris*",
    "He also passed through all the degrees of licentiate, master, and doctor of arts.--*Paris*",
    "He studied the languages, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, a triple sanctuary then very little frequented.--*Paris*",
    "His was a veritable fever for acquiring and hoarding, in the matter of science.--*Paris*",
    "At the age of eighteen, he had made his way through the four faculties; it seemed to the young man that life had but one sole object: learning.--*Paris*",
    "It was towards this epoch, that the excessive heat of the summer of 1466 caused that grand outburst of the plague which carried off more than forty thousand souls in the vicomty of Paris, and among others, as Jean de Troyes states, \"Master Arnoul, astrologer to the king, who was a very fine man, both wise and pleasant.\"--*Paris*",
    "The rumor spread in the University that the Rue Tirechappe was especially devastated by the malady.--*Paris*",
    "It was there that Claude's parents resided, in the midst of their fief.--*Paris*",
    "The young scholar rushed in great alarm to the paternal mansion.--*Paris*",
    "When he entered it, he found that both father and mother had died on the preceding day.--*Paris*",
    "A very young brother of his, who was in swaddling clothes, was still alive and crying abandoned in his cradle.--*Paris*",
    "This was all that remained to Claude of his family; the young man took the child under his arm and went off in a pensive mood.--*Paris*",
    "Up to that moment, he had lived only in science; he now began to live in life.--*Paris*",
    "This catastrophe was a crisis in Claude's existence.--*Paris*",
    "Orphaned, the eldest, head of the family at the age of nineteen, he felt himself rudely recalled from the reveries of school to the realities of this world.--*Paris*",
    "Then, moved with pity, he was seized with passion and devotion towards that child, his brother; a sweet and strange thing was a human affection to him, who had hitherto loved his books alone.--*Paris*",
    "This affection developed to a singular point; in a soul so new, it was like a first love.--*Paris*",
    "Separated since infancy from his parents, whom he had hardly known; cloistered and immured, as it were, in his books; eager above all things to study and to learn; exclusively attentive up to that time, to his intelligence which broadened in science, to his imagination, which expanded in letters,--the poor scholar had not yet had time to feel the place of his heart.--*Paris*",
    "This young brother, without mother or father, this little child which had fallen abruptly from heaven into his arms, made a new man of him.--*Paris*",
    "He perceived that there was something else in the world besides the speculations of the Sorbonne, and the verses of Homer; that man needed affections; that life without tenderness and without love was only a set of dry, shrieking, and rending wheels.--*Paris*",
    "Only, he imagined, for he was at the age when illusions are as yet replaced only by illusions, that the affections of blood and family were the sole ones necessary, and that a little brother to love sufficed to fill an entire existence.--*Paris*",
    "He threw himself, therefore, into the love for his little Jehan with the passion of a character already profound, ardent, concentrated; that poor frail creature, pretty, fair- haired, rosy, and curly,--that orphan with another orphan for his only support, touched him to the bottom of his heart; and grave thinker as he was, he set to meditating upon Jehan with an infinite compassion.--*Paris*",
    "He kept watch and ward over him as over something very fragile, and very worthy of care.--*Paris*",
    "He was more than a brother to the child; he became a mother to him.--*Paris*",
    "Little Jehan had lost his mother while he was still at the breast; Claude gave him to a nurse.--*Paris*",
    "Besides the fief of Tirechappe, he had inherited from his father the fief of Moulin, which was a dependency of the square tower of Gentilly; it was a mill on a hill, near the chateau of Winchestre (Bic\u00eatre).--*Paris*",
    "There was a miller's wife there who was nursing a fine child; it was not far from the university, and Claude carried the little Jehan to her in his own arms.--*Paris*",
    "From that time forth, feeling that he had a burden to bear, he took life very seriously.--*Paris*",
    "The thought of his little brother became not only his recreation, but the object of his studies.--*Paris*",
    "He resolved to consecrate himself entirely to a future for which he was responsible in the sight of God, and never to have any other wife, any other child than the happiness and fortune of his brother.--*Paris*",
    "Therefore, he attached himself more closely than ever to the clerical profession.--*Paris*",
    "His merits, his learning, his quality of immediate vassal of the Bishop of Paris, threw the doors of the church wide open to him.--*Paris*",
    "At the age of twenty, by special dispensation of the Holy See, he was a priest, and served as the youngest of the chaplains of Notre-Dame the altar which is called, because of the late mass which is said there, ~altare pigrorum~.--*Paris*",
    "There, plunged more deeply than ever in his dear books, which he quitted only to run for an hour to the fief of Moulin, this mixture of learning and austerity, so rare at his age, had promptly acquired for him the respect and admiration of the monastery.--*Paris*",
    "From the cloister, his reputation as a learned man had passed to the people, among whom it had changed a little, a frequent occurrence at that time, into reputation as a sorcerer.--*Paris*",
    "It was at the moment when he was returning, on Quasimodo day, from saying his mass at the Altar of the Lazy, which was by the side of the door leading to the nave on the right, near the image of the Virgin, that his attention had been attracted by the group of old women chattering around the bed for foundlings.--*Paris*",
    "Then it was that he approached the unhappy little creature, which was so hated and so menaced.--*Paris*",
    "That distress, that deformity, that abandonment, the thought of his young brother, the idea which suddenly occurred to him, that if he were to die, his dear little Jehan might also be flung miserably on the plank for foundlings,--all this had gone to his heart simultaneously; a great pity had moved in him, and he had carried off the child.--*Paris*",
    "When he removed the child from the sack, he found it greatly deformed, in very sooth.--*Paris*",
    "The poor little wretch had a wart on his left eye, his head placed directly on his shoulders, his spinal column was crooked, his breast bone prominent, and his legs bowed; but he appeared to be lively; and although it was impossible to say in what language he lisped, his cry indicated considerable force and health.--*Paris*",
    "Claude's compassion increased at the sight of this ugliness; and he made a vow in his heart to rear the child for the love of his brother, in order that, whatever might be the future faults of the little Jehan, he should have beside him that charity done for his sake.--*Paris*",
    "It was a sort of investment of good works, which he was effecting in the name of his young brother; it was a stock of good works which he wished to amass in advance for him, in case the little rogue should some day find himself short of that coin, the only sort which is received at the toll-bar of paradise.--*Paris*",
    "He baptized his adopted child, and gave him the name of Quasimodo, either because he desired thereby to mark the day, when he had found him, or because he wished to designate by that name to what a degree the poor little creature was incomplete, and hardly sketched out.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, Quasimodo, blind, hunchbacked, knock-kneed, was only an \"almost.\"--*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 3 Immanis Pecoris Custos,Immanior Ipse--*Paris*",
    "Now, in 1482, Quasimodo had grown up.--*Paris*",
    "He had become a few years previously the bellringer of Notre-Dame, thanks to his father by adoption, Claude Frollo,--who had become archdeacon of Josas, thanks to his suzerain, Messire Louis de Beaumont,--who had become Bishop of Paris, at the death of Guillaume Chartier in 1472, thanks to his patron, Olivier Le Daim, barber to Louis XI., king by the grace of God.--*Paris*",
    "So Quasimodo was the ringer of the chimes of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "In the course of time there had been formed a certain peculiarly intimate bond which united the ringer to the church.--*Paris*",
    "Separated forever from the world, by the double fatality of his unknown birth and his natural deformity, imprisoned from his infancy in that impassable double circle, the poor wretch had grown used to seeing nothing in this world beyond the religious walls which had received him under their shadow.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame had been to him successively, as he grew up and developed, the egg, the nest, the house, the country, the universe.--*Paris*",
    "There was certainly a sort of mysterious and pre-existing harmony between this creature and this church.--*Paris*",
    "When, still a little fellow, he had dragged himself tortuously and by jerks beneath the shadows of its vaults, he seemed, with his human face and his bestial limbs, the natural reptile of that humid and sombre pavement, upon which the shadow of the Romanesque capitals cast so many strange forms.--*Paris*",
    "Later on, the first time that he caught hold, mechanically, of the ropes to the towers, and hung suspended from them, and set the bell to clanging, it produced upon his adopted father, Claude, the effect of a child whose tongue is unloosed and who begins to speak.--*Paris*",
    "It is thus that, little by little, developing always in sympathy with the cathedral, living there, sleeping there, hardly ever leaving it, subject every hour to the mysterious impress, he came to resemble it, he incrusted himself in it, so to speak, and became an integral part of it.--*Paris*",
    "His salient angles fitted into the retreating angles of the cathedral (if we may be allowed this figure of speech), and he seemed not only its inhabitant but more than that, its natural tenant.--*Paris*",
    "One might almost say that he had assumed its form, as the snail takes on the form of its shell.--*Paris*",
    "It was his dwelling, his hole, his envelope.--*Paris*",
    "There existed between him and the old church so profound an instinctive sympathy, so many magnetic affinities, so many material affinities, that he adhered to it somewhat as a tortoise adheres to its shell.--*Paris*",
    "The rough and wrinkled cathedral was his shell.--*Paris*",
    "It is useless to warn the reader not to take literally all the similes which we are obliged to employ here to express the singular, symmetrical, direct, almost consubstantial union of a man and an edifice.--*Paris*",
    "It is equally unnecessary to state to what a degree that whole cathedral was familiar to him, after so long and so intimate a cohabitation.--*Paris*",
    "That dwelling was peculiar to him.--*Paris*",
    "It had no depths to which Quasimodo had not penetrated, no height which he had not scaled.--*Paris*",
    "He often climbed many stones up the front, aided solely by the uneven points of the carving.--*Paris*",
    "The towers, on whose exterior surface he was frequently seen clambering, like a lizard gliding along a perpendicular wall, those two gigantic twins, so lofty, so menacing, so formidable, possessed for him neither vertigo, nor terror, nor shocks of amazement.--*Paris*",
    "To see them so gentle under his hand, so easy to scale, one would have said that he had tamed them.--*Paris*",
    "By dint of leaping, climbing, gambolling amid the abysses of the gigantic cathedral he had become, in some sort, a monkey and a goat, like the Calabrian child who swims before he walks, and plays with the sea while still a babe.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, it was not his body alone which seemed fashioned after the Cathedral, but his mind also.--*Paris*",
    "In what condition was that mind?--*Paris*",
    "What bent had it contracted, what form had it assumed beneath that knotted envelope, in that savage life?--*Paris*",
    "This it would be hard to determine.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had been born one-eyed, hunchbacked, lame.--*Paris*",
    "It was with great difficulty, and by dint of great patience that Claude Frollo had succeeded in teaching him to talk.--*Paris*",
    "But a fatality was attached to the poor foundling.--*Paris*",
    "Bellringer of Notre-Dame at the age of fourteen, a new infirmity had come to complete his misfortunes: the bells had broken the drums of his ears; he had become deaf.--*Paris*",
    "The only gate which nature had left wide open for him had been abruptly closed, and forever.--*Paris*",
    "In closing, it had cut off the only ray of joy and of light which still made its way into the soul of Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "His soul fell into profound night.--*Paris*",
    "The wretched being's misery became as incurable and as complete as his deformity.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that his deafness rendered him to some extent dumb.--*Paris*",
    "For, in order not to make others laugh, the very moment that he found himself to be deaf, he resolved upon a silence which he only broke when he was alone.--*Paris*",
    "He voluntarily tied that tongue which Claude Frollo had taken so much pains to unloose.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, it came about, that when necessity constrained him to speak, his tongue was torpid, awkward, and like a door whose hinges have grown rusty.--*Paris*",
    "If now we were to try to penetrate to the soul of Quasimodo through that thick, hard rind; if we could sound the depths of that badly constructed organism; if it were granted to us to look with a torch behind those non-transparent organs to explore the shadowy interior of that opaque creature, to elucidate his obscure corners, his absurd no-thoroughfares, and suddenly to cast a vivid light upon the soul enchained at the extremity of that cave, we should, no doubt, find the unhappy Psyche in some poor, cramped, and ricketty attitude, like those prisoners beneath the Leads of Venice, who grew old bent double in a stone box which was both too low and too short for them.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that the mind becomes atrophied in a defective body.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was barely conscious of a soul cast in his own image, moving blindly within him.--*Paris*",
    "The impressions of objects underwent a considerable refraction before reaching his mind.--*Paris*",
    "His brain was a peculiar medium; the ideas which passed through it issued forth completely distorted.--*Paris*",
    "The reflection which resulted from this refraction was, necessarily, divergent and perverted.--*Paris*",
    "Hence a thousand optical illusions, a thousand aberrations of judgment, a thousand deviations, in which his thought strayed, now mad, now idiotic.--*Paris*",
    "The first effect of this fatal organization was to trouble the glance which he cast upon things.--*Paris*",
    "He received hardly any immediate perception of them.--*Paris*",
    "The external world seemed much farther away to him than it does to us.--*Paris*",
    "The second effect of his misfortune was to render him malicious.--*Paris*",
    "He was malicious, in fact, because he was savage; he was savage because he was ugly.--*Paris*",
    "There was logic in his nature, as there is in ours.--*Paris*",
    "His strength, so extraordinarily developed, was a cause of still greater malevolence: \"~Malus puer robustus~,\" says Hobbes.--*Paris*",
    "This justice must, however be rendered to him.--*Paris*",
    "Malevolence was not, perhaps, innate in him.--*Paris*",
    "From his very first steps among men, he had felt himself, later on he had seen himself, spewed out, blasted, rejected.--*Paris*",
    "Human words were, for him, always a raillery or a malediction.--*Paris*",
    "As he grew up, he had found nothing but hatred around him.--*Paris*",
    "He had caught the general malevolence.--*Paris*",
    "He had picked up the weapon with which he had been wounded.--*Paris*",
    "After all, he turned his face towards men only with reluctance; his cathedral was sufficient for him.--*Paris*",
    "It was peopled with marble figures,--kings, saints, bishops,--who at least did not burst out laughing in his face, and who gazed upon him only with tranquillity and kindliness.--*Paris*",
    "The other statues, those of the monsters and demons, cherished no hatred for him, Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He resembled them too much for that.--*Paris*",
    "They seemed rather, to be scoffing at other men.--*Paris*",
    "The saints were his friends, and blessed him; the monsters were his friends and guarded him.--*Paris*",
    "So he held long communion with them.--*Paris*",
    "He sometimes passed whole hours crouching before one of these statues, in solitary conversation with it.--*Paris*",
    "If any one came, he fled like a lover surprised in his serenade.--*Paris*",
    "And the cathedral was not only society for him, but the universe, and all nature beside.--*Paris*",
    "He dreamed of no other hedgerows than the painted windows, always in flower; no other shade than that of the foliage of stone which spread out, loaded with birds, in the tufts of the Saxon capitals; of no other mountains than the colossal towers of the church; of no other ocean than Paris, roaring at their bases.--*Paris*",
    "What he loved above all else in the maternal edifice, that which aroused his soul, and made it open its poor wings, which it kept so miserably folded in its cavern, that which sometimes rendered him even happy, was the bells.--*Paris*",
    "He loved them, fondled them, talked to them, understood them.--*Paris*",
    "From the chime in the spire, over the intersection of the aisles and nave, to the great bell of the front, he cherished a tenderness for them all.--*Paris*",
    "The central spire and the two towers were to him as three great cages, whose birds, reared by himself, sang for him alone.--*Paris*",
    "Yet it was these very bells which had made him deaf; but mothers often love best that child which has caused them the most suffering.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that their voice was the only one which he could still hear.--*Paris*",
    "On this score, the big bell was his beloved.--*Paris*",
    "It was she whom he preferred out of all that family of noisy girls which bustled above him, on festival days.--*Paris*",
    "This bell was named Marie.--*Paris*",
    "She was alone in the southern tower, with her sister Jacqueline, a bell of lesser size, shut up in a smaller cage beside hers.--*Paris*",
    "This Jacqueline was so called from the name of the wife of Jean Montagu, who had given it to the church, which had not prevented his going and figuring without his head at Montfau?on.--*Paris*",
    "In the second tower there were six other bells, and, finally, six smaller ones inhabited the belfry over the crossing, with the wooden bell, which rang only between after dinner on Good Friday and the morning of the day before Easter.--*Paris*",
    "So Quasimodo had fifteen bells in his seraglio; but big Marie was his favorite.--*Paris*",
    "No idea can be formed of his delight on days when the grand peal was sounded.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when the archdeacon dismissed him, and said, \"Go!\"--*Paris*",
    "he mounted the spiral staircase of the clock tower faster than any one else could have descended it.--*Paris*",
    "He entered perfectly breathless into the aerial chamber of the great bell; he gazed at her a moment, devoutly and lovingly; then he gently addressed her and patted her with his hand, like a good horse, which is about to set out on a long journey.--*Paris*",
    "He pitied her for the trouble that she was about to suffer.--*Paris*",
    "After these first caresses, he shouted to his assistants, placed in the lower story of the tower, to begin.--*Paris*",
    "They grasped the ropes, the wheel creaked, the enormous capsule of metal started slowly into motion.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo followed it with his glance and trembled.--*Paris*",
    "The first shock of the clapper and the brazen wall made the framework upon which it was mounted quiver.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo vibrated with the bell.--*Paris*",
    "It was the only speech which he understood, the only sound which broke for him the universal silence.--*Paris*",
    "He swelled out in it as a bird does in the sun.--*Paris*",
    "All of a sudden, the frenzy of the bell seized upon him; his look became extraordinary; he lay in wait for the great bell as it passed, as a spider lies in wait for a fly, and flung himself abruptly upon it, with might and main.--*Paris*",
    "Then, suspended above the abyss, borne to and fro by the formidable swinging of the bell, he seized the brazen monster by the ear-laps, pressed it between both knees, spurred it on with his heels, and redoubled the fury of the peal with the whole shock and weight of his body.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the tower trembled; he shrieked and gnashed his teeth, his red hair rose erect, his breast heaving like a bellows, his eye flashed flames, the monstrous bell neighed, panting, beneath him; and then it was no longer the great bell of Notre- Dame nor Quasimodo: it was a dream, a whirlwind, a tempest, dizziness mounted astride of noise; a spirit clinging to a flying crupper, a strange centaur, half man, half bell; a sort of horrible Astolphus, borne away upon a prodigious hippogriff of living bronze.--*Paris*",
    "The presence of this extraordinary being caused, as it were, a breath of life to circulate throughout the entire cathedral.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed as though there escaped from him, at least according to the growing superstitions of the crowd, a mysterious emanation which animated all the stones of Notre-Dame, and made the deep bowels of the ancient church to palpitate.--*Paris*",
    "It sufficed for people to know that he was there, to make them believe that they beheld the thousand statues of the galleries and the fronts in motion.--*Paris*",
    "And the cathedral did indeed seem a docile and obedient creature beneath his hand; it waited on his will to raise its great voice; it was possessed and filled with Quasimodo, as with a familiar spirit.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that he made the immense edifice breathe.--*Paris*",
    "He was everywhere about it; in fact, he multiplied himself on all points of the structure.--*Paris*",
    "Now one perceived with affright at the very top of one of the towers, a fantastic dwarf climbing, writhing, crawling on all fours, descending outside above the abyss, leaping from projection to projection, and going to ransack the belly of some sculptured gorgon; it was Quasimodo dislodging the crows.--*Paris*",
    "Again, in some obscure corner of the church one came in contact with a sort of living chimera, crouching and scowling; it was Quasimodo engaged in thought.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes one caught sight, upon a bell tower, of an enormous head and a bundle of disordered limbs swinging furiously at the end of a rope; it was Quasimodo ringing vespers or the Angelus.--*Paris*",
    "Often at night a hideous form was seen wandering along the frail balustrade of carved lacework, which crowns the towers and borders the circumference of the apse; again it was the hunchback of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Then, said the women of the neighborhood, the whole church took on something fantastic, supernatural, horrible; eyes and mouths were opened, here and there; one heard the dogs, the monsters, and the gargoyles of stone, which keep watch night and day, with outstretched neck and open jaws, around the monstrous cathedral, barking.--*Paris*",
    "And, if it was a Christmas Eve, while the great bell, which seemed to emit the death rattle, summoned the faithful to the midnight mass, such an air was spread over the sombre fa?ade that one would have declared that the grand portal was devouring the throng, and that the rose window was watching it.--*Paris*",
    "And all this came from Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "Egypt would have taken him for the god of this temple; the Middle Ages believed him to be its demon: he was in fact its soul.--*Paris*",
    "To such an extent was this disease that for those who know that Quasimodo has existed, Notre-Dame is to-day deserted, inanimate, dead.--*Paris*",
    "One feels that something has disappeared from it.--*Paris*",
    "That immense body is empty; it is a skeleton; the spirit has quitted it, one sees its place and that is all.--*Paris*",
    "It is like a skull which still has holes for the eyes, but no longer sight.--*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 4 The Dog And His Master--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, there was one human creature whom Quasimodo excepted from his malice and from his hatred for others, and whom he loved even more, perhaps, than his cathedral: this was Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "The matter was simple; Claude Frollo had taken him in, had adopted him, had nourished him, had reared him.--*Paris*",
    "When a little lad, it was between Claude Frollo's legs that he was accustomed to seek refuge, when the dogs and the children barked after him.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo had taught him to talk, to read, to write.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo had finally made him the bellringer.--*Paris*",
    "Now, to give the big bell in marriage to Quasimodo was to give Juliet to Romeo.--*Paris*",
    "Hence Quasimodo's gratitude was profound, passionate, boundless; and although the visage of his adopted father was often clouded or severe, although his speech was habitually curt, harsh, imperious, that gratitude never wavered for a single moment.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon had in Quasimodo the most submissive slave, the most docile lackey, the most vigilant of dogs.--*Paris*",
    "When the poor bellringer became deaf, there had been established between him and Claude Frollo, a language of signs, mysterious and understood by themselves alone.--*Paris*",
    "In this manner the archdeacon was the sole human being with whom Quasimodo had preserved communication.--*Paris*",
    "He was in sympathy with but two things in this world: Notre- Dame and Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "There is nothing which can be compared with the empire of the archdeacon over the bellringer; with the attachment of the bellringer for the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "A sign from Claude and the idea of giving him pleasure would have sufficed to make Quasimodo hurl himself headlong from the summit of Notre- Dame.--*Paris*",
    "It was a remarkable thing--all that physical strength which had reached in Quasimodo such an extraordinary development, and which was placed by him blindly at the disposition of another.--*Paris*",
    "There was in it, no doubt, filial devotion, domestic attachment; there was also the fascination of one spirit by another spirit.--*Paris*",
    "It was a poor, awkward, and clumsy organization, which stood with lowered head and supplicating eyes before a lofty and profound, a powerful and superior intellect.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, and above all, it was gratitude.--*Paris*",
    "Gratitude so pushed to its extremest limit, that we do not know to what to compare it.--*Paris*",
    "This virtue is not one of those of which the finest examples are to be met with among men.--*Paris*",
    "We will say then, that Quasimodo loved the archdeacon as never a dog, never a horse, never an elephant loved his master.--*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 5 More About Claude Frollo--*Paris*",
    "In 1482, Quasimodo was about twenty years of age; Claude Frollo, about thirty-six.--*Paris*",
    "One had grown up, the other had grown old.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo was no longer the simple scholar of the college of Torch, the tender protector of a little child, the young and dreamy philosopher who knew many things and was ignorant of many.--*Paris*",
    "He was a priest, austere, grave, morose; one charged with souls; monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, the bishop's second acolyte, having charge of the two deaneries of Montlh\u00e9ry, and Chateaufort, and one hundred and seventy-four country curacies.--*Paris*",
    "He was an imposing and sombre personage, before whom the choir boys in alb and in jacket trembled, as well as the machicots*, and the brothers of Saint-Augustine and the matutinal clerks of Notre-Dame, when he passed slowly beneath the lofty arches of the choir, majestic, thoughtful, with arms folded and his head so bent upon his breast that all one saw of his face was his large, bald brow.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude Frollo had, however, abandoned neither science nor the education of his young brother, those two occupations of his life.--*Paris*",
    "But as time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things which were so sweet.--*Paris*",
    "In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best lard turns rancid.--*Paris*",
    "Little Jehan Frollo, surnamed (~du Moulin~) \"of the Mill\" because of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the direction which Claude would have liked to impose upon him.--*Paris*",
    "The big brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil.--*Paris*",
    "But the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and air, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only put forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness, ignorance, and debauchery.--*Paris*",
    "He was a regular devil, and a very disorderly one, who made Dom Claude scowl; but very droll and very subtle, which made the big brother smile.--*Paris*",
    "Claude had confided him to that same college of Torchi where he had passed his early years in study and meditation; and it was a grief to him that this sanctuary, formerly edified by the name of Frollo, should to-day be scandalized by it.--*Paris*",
    "He sometimes preached Jehan very long and severe sermons, which the latter intrepidly endured.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the young scapegrace had a good heart, as can be seen in all comedies.--*Paris*",
    "But the sermon over, he none the less tranquilly resumed his course of seditions and enormities.--*Paris*",
    "Now it was a ~bejaune~ or yellow beak (as they called the new arrivals at the university), whom he had been mauling by way of welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully preserved to our own day.--*Paris*",
    "Again, he had set in movement a band of scholars, who had flung themselves upon a wine-shop in classic fashion, quasi ~classico excitati~, had then beaten the tavern-keeper \"with offensive cudgels,\" and joyously pillaged the tavern, even to smashing in the hogsheads of wine in the cellar.--*Paris*",
    "And then it was a fine report in Latin, which the sub-monitor of Torchi carried piteously to Dom Claude with this dolorous marginal comment,--~Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum potatum~.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, it was said, a thing quite horrible in a boy of sixteen, that his debauchery often extended as far as the Rue de Glatigny.--*Paris*",
    "Claude, saddened and discouraged in his human affections, by all this, had flung himself eagerly into the arms of learning, that sister which, at least does not laugh in your face, and which always pays you, though in money that is sometimes a little hollow, for the attention which you have paid to her.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, he became more and more learned, and, at the same time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a priest, more and more sad as a man.--*Paris*",
    "There are for each of us several parallelisms between our intelligence, our habits, and our character, which develop without a break, and break only in the great disturbances of life.--*Paris*",
    "As Claude Frollo had passed through nearly the entire circle of human learning--positive, exterior, and permissible--since his youth, he was obliged, unless he came to a halt, ~ubi defuit orbis~, to proceed further and seek other aliments for the insatiable activity of his intelligence.--*Paris*",
    "The antique symbol of the serpent biting its tail is, above all, applicable to science.--*Paris*",
    "It would appear that Claude Frollo had experienced this.--*Paris*",
    "Many grave persons affirm that, after having exhausted the ~fas~ of human learning, he had dared to penetrate into the ~nefas~.--*Paris*",
    "He had, they said, tasted in succession all the apples of the tree of knowledge, and, whether from hunger or disgust, had ended by tasting the forbidden fruit.--*Paris*",
    "He had taken his place by turns, as the reader has seen, in the conferences of the theologians in Sorbonne,--in the assemblies of the doctors of art, after the manner of Saint-Hilaire,--in the disputes of the decretalists, after the manner of Saint-Martin,--in the congregations of physicians at the holy water font of Notre- Dame, ~ad cupam Nostroe-Dominoe~.--*Paris*",
    "All the dishes permitted and approved, which those four great kitchens called the four faculties could elaborate and serve to the understanding, he had devoured, and had been satiated with them before his hunger was appeased.--*Paris*",
    "Then he had penetrated further, lower, beneath all that finished, material, limited knowledge; he had, perhaps, risked his soul, and had seated himself in the cavern at that mysterious table of the alchemists, of the astrologers, of the hermetics, of which Averro\u00e8s, Gillaume de Paris, and Nicolas Flamel hold the end in the Middle Ages; and which extends in the East, by the light of the seven- branched candlestick, to Solomon, Pythagoras, and Zoroaster.--*Paris*",
    "That is, at least, what was supposed, whether rightly or not.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that the archdeacon often visited the cemetery of the Saints-Innocents, where, it is true, his father and mother had been buried, with other victims of the plague of 1466; but that he appeared far less devout before the cross of their grave than before the strange figures with which the tomb of Nicolas Flamel and Claude Pernelle, erected just beside it, was loaded.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that he had frequently been seen to pass along the Rue des Lombards, and furtively enter a little house which formed the corner of the Rue des Ecrivans and the Rue Marivault.--*Paris*",
    "It was the house which Nicolas Flamel had built, where he had died about 1417, and which, constantly deserted since that time, had already begun to fall in ruins,--so greatly had the hermetics and the alchemists of all countries wasted away the walls, merely by carving their names upon them.--*Paris*",
    "Some neighbors even affirm that they had once seen, through an air-hole, Archdeacon Claude excavating, turning over, digging up the earth in the two cellars, whose supports had been daubed with numberless couplets and hieroglyphics by Nicolas Flamel himself.--*Paris*",
    "It was supposed that Flamel had buried the philosopher's stone in the cellar; and the alchemists, for the space of two centuries, from Magistri to Father Pacifique, never ceased to worry the soil until the house, so cruelly ransacked and turned over, ended by falling into dust beneath their feet.--*Paris*",
    "Again, it is certain that the archdeacon had been seized with a singular passion for the symbolical door of Notre- Dame, that page of a conjuring book written in stone, by Bishop Guillaume de Paris, who has, no doubt, been damned for having affixed so infernal a frontispiece to the sacred poem chanted by the rest of the edifice.--*Paris*",
    "Archdeacon Claude had the credit also of having fathomed the mystery of the colossus of Saint Christopher, and of that lofty, enigmatical statue which then stood at the entrance of the vestibule, and which the people, in derision, called \"Monsieur Legris.\"--*Paris*",
    "But, what every one might have noticed was the interminable hours which he often employed, seated upon the parapet of the area in front of the church, in contemplating the sculptures of the front; examining now the foolish virgins with their lamps reversed, now the wise virgins with their lamps upright; again, calculating the angle of vision of that raven which belongs to the left front, and which is looking at a mysterious point inside the church, where is concealed the philosopher's stone, if it be not in the cellar of Nicolas Flamel.--*Paris*",
    "It was, let us remark in passing, a singular fate for the Church of Notre-Dame at that epoch to be so beloved, in two different degrees, and with so much devotion, by two beings so dissimilar as Claude and Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "Beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from its magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate imagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front,--like the first text underneath the second in a palimpsest,--in a word, for the enigma which it is eternally propounding to the understanding.--*Paris*",
    "Furthermore, it is certain that the archdeacon had established himself in that one of the two towers which looks upon the Gr\u00e8ve, just beside the frame for the bells, a very secret little cell, into which no one, not even the bishop, entered without his leave, it was said.--*Paris*",
    "This tiny cell had formerly been made almost at the summit of the tower, among the ravens' nests, by Bishop Hugo de Besan?on* who had wrought sorcery there in his day.--*Paris*",
    "What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows, and to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light.--*Paris*",
    "In the darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said: \"There's the archdeacon blowing!--*Paris*",
    "hell is sparkling up yonder!\"--*Paris*",
    "There were no great proofs of sorcery in that, after all, but there was still enough smoke to warrant a surmise of fire, and the archdeacon bore a tolerably formidable reputation.--*Paris*",
    "We ought to mention however, that the sciences of Egypt, that necromancy and magic, even the whitest, even the most innocent, had no more envenomed enemy, no more pitiless denunciator before the gentlemen of the officialty of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Whether this was sincere horror, or the game played by the thief who shouts, \"stop thief!\"--*Paris*",
    "at all events, it did not prevent the archdeacon from being considered by the learned heads of the chapter, as a soul who had ventured into the vestibule of hell, who was lost in the caves of the cabal, groping amid the shadows of the occult sciences.--*Paris*",
    "Neither were the people deceived thereby; with any one who possessed any sagacity, Quasimodo passed for the demon; Claude Frollo, for the sorcerer.--*Paris*",
    "It was evident that the bellringer was to serve the archdeacon for a given time, at the end of which he would carry away the latter's soul, by way of payment.--*Paris*",
    "Thus the archdeacon, in spite of the excessive austerity of his life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout nose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a magician.--*Paris*",
    "And if, as he grew older, abysses had formed in his science, they had also formed in his heart.--*Paris*",
    "That at least, is what one had grounds for believing on scrutinizing that face upon which the soul was only seen to shine through a sombre cloud.--*Paris*",
    "Whence that large, bald brow?--*Paris*",
    "that head forever bent?--*Paris*",
    "that breast always heaving with sighs?--*Paris*",
    "What secret thought caused his mouth to smile with so much bitterness, at the same moment that his scowling brows approached each other like two bulls on the point of fighting?--*Paris*",
    "Why was what hair he had left already gray?--*Paris*",
    "What was that internal fire which sometimes broke forth in his glance, to such a degree that his eye resembled a hole pierced in the wall of a furnace?--*Paris*",
    "These symptoms of a violent moral preoccupation, had acquired an especially high degree of intensity at the epoch when this story takes place.--*Paris*",
    "More than once a choir-boy had fled in terror at finding him alone in the church, so strange and dazzling was his look.--*Paris*",
    "More than once, in the choir, at the hour of the offices, his neighbor in the stalls had heard him mingle with the plain song, ~ad omnem tonum~, unintelligible parentheses.--*Paris*",
    "More than once the laundress of the Terrain charged \"with washing the chapter\" had observed, not without affright, the marks of nails and clenched fingers on the surplice of monsieur the archdeacon of Josas.--*Paris*",
    "However, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary.--*Paris*",
    "By profession as well as by character, he had always held himself aloof from women; he seemed to hate them more than ever.--*Paris*",
    "The mere rustling of a silken petticoat caused his hood to fall over his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Upon this score he was so jealous of austerity and reserve, that when the Dame de Beaujeu, the king's daughter, came to visit the cloister of Notre-Dame, in the month of December, 1481, he gravely opposed her entrance, reminding the bishop of the statute of the Black Book, dating from the vigil of Saint-Barth\u00e9lemy, 1334, which interdicts access to the cloister to \"any woman whatever, old or young, mistress or maid.\"--*Paris*",
    "Upon which the bishop had been constrained to recite to him the ordinance of Legate Odo, which excepts certain great dames, ~aliquoe magnates mulieres, quoe sine scandalo vitari non possunt~.--*Paris*",
    "And again the archdeacon had protested, objecting that the ordinance of the legate, which dated back to 1207, was anterior by a hundred and twenty-seven years to the Black Book, and consequently was abrogated in fact by it.--*Paris*",
    "And he had refused to appear before the princess.--*Paris*",
    "It was also noticed that his horror for Bohemian women and gypsies had seemed to redouble for some time past.--*Paris*",
    "He had petitioned the bishop for an edict which expressly forbade the Bohemian women to come and dance and beat their tambourines on the place of the Parvis; and for about the same length of time, he had been ransacking the mouldy placards of the officialty, in order to collect the cases of sorcerers and witches condemned to fire or the rope, for complicity in crimes with rams, sows, or goats.--*Paris*",
    "Book 4 Chapter 6 Unpopularity--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon and the bellringer, as we have already said, were but little loved by the populace great and small, in the vicinity of the cathedral.--*Paris*",
    "When Claude and Quasimodo went out together, which frequently happened, and when they were seen traversing in company, the valet behind the master, the cold, narrow, and gloomy streets of the block of Notre-Dame, more than one evil word, more than one ironical quaver, more than one insulting jest greeted them on their way, unless Claude Frollo, which was rarely the case, walked with head upright and raised, showing his severe and almost august brow to the dumbfounded jeerers.--*Paris*",
    "Both were in their quarter like \"the poets\" of whom R\u00e9gnier speaks,----*Paris*",
    "Sometimes a mischievous child risked his skin and bones for the ineffable pleasure of driving a pin into Quasimodo's hump.--*Paris*",
    "Again, a young girl, more bold and saucy than was fitting, brushed the priest's black robe, singing in his face the sardonic ditty, \"niche, niche, the devil is caught.\"--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes a group of squalid old crones, squatting in a file under the shadow of the steps to a porch, scolded noisily as the archdeacon and the bellringer passed, and tossed them this encouraging welcome, with a curse: \"Hum!--*Paris*",
    "there's a fellow whose soul is made like the other one's body!\"--*Paris*",
    "Or a band of schoolboys and street urchins, playing hop-scotch, rose in a body and saluted him classically, with some cry in Latin: \"~Eia!--*Paris*",
    "eia!--*Paris*",
    "Claudius cum claudo~!\"--*Paris*",
    "But the insult generally passed unnoticed both by the priest and the bellringer.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was too deaf to hear all these gracious things, and Claude was too dreamy.--*Paris*",
    "Book 5 Chapter 1 Abbas Beati Martini--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude's fame had spread far and wide.--*Paris*",
    "It procured for him, at about the epoch when he refused to see Madame de Beaujeu, a visit which he long remembered.--*Paris*",
    "It was in the evening.--*Paris*",
    "He had just retired, after the office, to his canon's cell in the cloister of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "This cell, with the exception, possibly, of some glass phials, relegated to a corner, and filled with a decidedly equivocal powder, which strongly resembled the alchemist's \"powder of projection,\" presented nothing strange or mysterious.--*Paris*",
    "There were, indeed, here and there, some inscriptions on the walls, but they were pure sentences of learning and piety, extracted from good authors.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon had just seated himself, by the light of a three-jetted copper lamp, before a vast coffer crammed with manuscripts.--*Paris*",
    "He had rested his elbow upon the open volume of _Honorius d'Autun_, ~De predestinatione et libero arbitrio~, and he was turning over, in deep meditation, the leaves of a printed folio which he had just brought, the sole product of the press which his cell contained.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of his revery there came a knock at his door.--*Paris*",
    "A voice without replied, \"Your friend, Jacques Coictier.\"--*Paris*",
    "He went to open the door.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, the king's physician; a person about fifty years of age, whose harsh physiognomy was modified only by a crafty eye.--*Paris*",
    "Another man accompanied him.--*Paris*",
    "Both wore long slate-colored robes, furred with minever, girded and closed, with caps of the same stuff and hue.--*Paris*",
    "Their hands were concealed by their sleeves, their feet by their robes, their eyes by their caps.--*Paris*",
    "There then ensued between the physician and the archdeacon one of those congratulatory prologues which, in accordance with custom, at that epoch preceded all conversations between learned men, and which did not prevent them from detesting each other in the most cordial manner in the world.--*Paris*",
    "However, it is the same nowadays; every wise man's mouth complimenting another wise man is a vase of honeyed gall.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo's felicitations to Jacques Coictier bore reference principally to the temporal advantages which the worthy physician had found means to extract, in the course of his much envied career, from each malady of the king, an operation of alchemy much better and more certain than the pursuit of the philosopher's stone.--*Paris*",
    "In the compliments which Dom Claude addressed to Jacques Coictier, there was that sardonical, biting, and covertly mocking accent, and the sad cruel smile of a superior and unhappy man who toys for a moment, by way of distraction, with the dense prosperity of a vulgar man.--*Paris*",
    "The other did not perceive it.--*Paris*",
    "These words, uttered in a tone of surprise and reproach, drew upon this unknown personage the attention of the archdeacon which, to tell the truth, had not been diverted from him a single moment since the stranger had set foot across the threshold of his cell.--*Paris*",
    "It had even required all the thousand reasons which he had for handling tenderly Doctor Jacques Coictier, the all-powerful physician of King Louis XI., to induce him to receive the latter thus accompanied.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, there was nothing very cordial in his manner when Jacques Coictier said to him,----*Paris*",
    "He was, so far as the feeble light of the lamp permitted one to judge, an old man about sixty years of age and of medium stature, who appeared somewhat sickly and broken in health.--*Paris*",
    "His profile, although of a very ordinary outline, had something powerful and severe about it; his eyes sparkled beneath a very deep superciliary arch, like a light in the depths of a cave; and beneath his cap which was well drawn down and fell upon his nose, one recognized the broad expanse of a brow of genius.--*Paris*",
    "He took it upon himself to reply to the archdeacon's question,----*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he had a feeling that he was in the presence of a strong and earnest character.--*Paris*",
    "The instinct of his own lofty intellect made him recognize an intellect no less lofty under Gossip Tourangeau's furred cap, and as he gazed at the solemn face, the ironical smile which Jacques Coictier's presence called forth on his gloomy face, gradually disappeared as twilight fades on the horizon of night.--*Paris*",
    "Stern and silent, he had resumed his seat in his great armchair; his elbow rested as usual, on the table, and his brow on his hand.--*Paris*",
    "After a few moments of reflection, he motioned his visitors to be seated, and, turning to Gossip Tourangeau he said,----*Paris*",
    "Gossip Tourangeau obeyed, and read this inscription engraved above his head: \"Medicine is the daughter of dreams.--JAMBLIQUE.\"--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Doctor Jacques Coictier had heard his companion's question with a displeasure which Dom Claude's response had but redoubled.--*Paris*",
    "He bent down to the ear of Gossip Tourangeau, and said to him, softly enough not to be heard by the archdeacon: \"I warned you that he was mad.--*Paris*",
    "You insisted on seeing him.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon replied without perturbation: \"There are certain things of which I think in a certain fashion.\"--*Paris*",
    "Coictier became crimson with anger.--*Paris*",
    "Coictier calmed down, muttering in a low tone,----*Paris*",
    "Coictier gave a forced laugh.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon hesitated for a moment, then he allowed a gloomy smile to escape, which seemed to give the lie to his response: \"~Credo in Deum~.\"--*Paris*",
    "Coictier exclaimed, \"Pardieu, Dom Claude, alchemy has its use, no doubt, but why blaspheme medicine and astrology?\"--*Paris*",
    "The fiery archdeacon did not allow him to finish: \"And I have studied medicine, astrology, and hermetics.--*Paris*",
    "Here alone is the truth.\"--*Paris*",
    "And he fell back in his armchair in a commanding and inspired attitude.--*Paris*",
    "Gossip Touraugeau watched him in silence.--*Paris*",
    "Coictier tried to grin, shrugged his shoulders imperceptibly, and repeated in a low voice,----*Paris*",
    "The stranger frowned.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon went on, appearing to reply now only to his thoughts,----*Paris*",
    "Claude assumed the majestic and pontifical attitude of a Samuel.--*Paris*",
    "Here Jacques Coictier, who had been unhorsed by the archdeacon's impetuous replies, regained his saddle, and interrupted him with the triumphant tone of one learned man correcting another,--\"~Erras amice Claudi~.--*Paris*",
    "The symbol is not the number.--*Paris*",
    "You take Orpheus for Hermes.\"--*Paris*",
    "For a long time, Gossip Tourangeau, intelligent as was his glance, had appeared not to understand Dom Claude.--*Paris*",
    "He interrupted.--*Paris*",
    "And opening the window of his cell he pointed out with his finger the immense church of Notre-Dame, which, outlining against the starry sky the black silhouette of its two towers, its stone flanks, its monstrous haunches, seemed an enormous two-headed sphinx, seated in the middle of the city.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon gazed at the gigantic edifice for some time in silence, then extending his right hand, with a sigh, towards the printed book which lay open on the table, and his left towards Notre-Dame, and turning a sad glance from the book to the church,--\"Alas,\" he said, \"this will kill that.\"--*Paris*",
    "Coictier, who had eagerly approached the book, could not repress an exclamation.--*Paris*",
    "The curfew of the cloister sounded at the moment when Master Jacques was repeating to his companion in low tones, his eternal refrain, \"He is mad!\"--*Paris*",
    "To which his companion this time replied, \"I believe that he is.\"--*Paris*",
    "It was the hour when no stranger could remain in the cloister.--*Paris*",
    "The two visitors withdrew.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon returned to his chamber dumbfounded, comprehending at last who Gossip Tourangeau was, and recalling that passage of the register of Sainte-Martin, of Tours:-- ~Abbas beati Martini, SCILICET REX FRANCIAE, est canonicus de consuetudine et habet parvam proebendam quam habet sanctus Venantius, et debet sedere in sede thesaurarii~.--*Paris*",
    "It is asserted that after that epoch the archdeacon had frequent conferences with Louis XI., when his majesty came to Paris, and that Dom Claude's influence quite overshadowed that of Olivier le Daim and Jacques Coictier, who, as was his habit, rudely took the king to task on that account.--*Paris*",
    "Book 5 Chapter 2 This Will Kill That--*Paris*",
    "Our lady readers will pardon us if we pause for a moment to seek what could have been the thought concealed beneath those enigmatic words of the archdeacon: \"This will kill that.--*Paris*",
    "The book will kill the edifice.\"--*Paris*",
    "To our mind, this thought had two faces.--*Paris*",
    "In the first place, it was a priestly thought.--*Paris*",
    "It was the affright of the priest in the presence of a new agent, the printing press.--*Paris*",
    "It was the terror and dazzled amazement of the men of the sanctuary, in the presence of the luminous press of Gutenberg.--*Paris*",
    "It was the pulpit and the manuscript taking the alarm at the printed word: something similar to the stupor of a sparrow which should behold the angel Legion unfold his six million wings.--*Paris*",
    "It was the cry of the prophet who already hears emancipated humanity roaring and swarming; who beholds in the future, intelligence sapping faith, opinion dethroning belief, the world shaking off Rome.--*Paris*",
    "It was the prognostication of the philosopher who sees human thought, volatilized by the press, evaporating from the theocratic recipient.--*Paris*",
    "It was the terror of the soldier who examines the brazen battering ram, and says:--\"The tower will crumble.\"--*Paris*",
    "It signified that one power was about to succeed another power.--*Paris*",
    "It meant, \"The press will kill the church.\"--*Paris*",
    "But underlying this thought, the first and most simple one, no doubt, there was in our opinion another, newer one, a corollary of the first, less easy to perceive and more easy to contest, a view as philosophical and belonging no longer to the priest alone but to the savant and the artist.--*Paris*",
    "It was a presentiment that human thought, in changing its form, was about to change its mode of expression; that the dominant idea of each generation would no longer be written with the same matter, and in the same manner; that the book of stone, so solid and so durable, was about to make way for the book of paper, more solid and still more durable.--*Paris*",
    "In this connection the archdeacon's vague formula had a second sense.--*Paris*",
    "It meant, \"Printing will kill architecture.\"--*Paris*",
    "In fact, from the origin of things down to the fifteenth century of the Christian era, inclusive, architecture is the great book of humanity, the principal expression of man in his different stages of development, either as a force or as an intelligence.--*Paris*",
    "When the memory of the first races felt itself overloaded, when the mass of reminiscences of the human race became so heavy and so confused that speech naked and flying, ran the risk of losing them on the way, men transcribed them on the soil in a manner which was at once the most visible, most durable, and most natural.--*Paris*",
    "They sealed each tradition beneath a monument.--*Paris*",
    "The first monuments were simple masses of rock, \"which the iron had not touched,\" as Moses says.--*Paris*",
    "Architecture began like all writing.--*Paris*",
    "It was first an alphabet.--*Paris*",
    "Men planted a stone upright, it was a letter, and each letter was a hieroglyph, and upon each hieroglyph rested a group of ideas, like the capital on the column.--*Paris*",
    "This is what the earliest races did everywhere, at the same moment, on the surface of the entire world.--*Paris*",
    "We find the \"standing stones\" of the Celts in Asian Siberia; in the pampas of America.--*Paris*",
    "Later on, they made words; they placed stone upon stone, they coupled those syllables of granite, and attempted some combinations.--*Paris*",
    "The Celtic dolmen and cromlech, the Etruscan tumulus, the Hebrew galgal, are words.--*Paris*",
    "Some, especially the tumulus, are proper names.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes even, when men had a great deal of stone, and a vast plain, they wrote a phrase.--*Paris*",
    "The immense pile of Karnac is a complete sentence.--*Paris*",
    "At last they made books.--*Paris*",
    "Traditions had brought forth symbols, beneath which they disappeared like the trunk of a tree beneath its foliage; all these symbols in which humanity placed faith continued to grow, to multiply, to intersect, to become more and more complicated; the first monuments no longer sufficed to contain them, they were overflowing in every part; these monuments hardly expressed now the primitive tradition, simple like themselves, naked and prone upon the earth.--*Paris*",
    "The symbol felt the need of expansion in the edifice.--*Paris*",
    "Then architecture was developed in proportion with human thought; it became a giant with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, and fixed all this floating symbolism in an eternal, visible, palpable form.--*Paris*",
    "While Daedalus, who is force, measured; while Orpheus, who is intelligence, sang;--the pillar, which is a letter; the arcade, which is a syllable; the pyramid, which is a word,--all set in movement at once by a law of geometry and by a law of poetry, grouped themselves, combined, amalgamated, descended, ascended, placed themselves side by side on the soil, ranged themselves in stories in the sky, until they had written under the dictation of the general idea of an epoch, those marvellous books which were also marvellous edifices: the Pagoda of Eklinga, the Rhamseion of Egypt, the Temple of Solomon.--*Paris*",
    "The generating idea, the word, was not only at the foundation of all these edifices, but also in the form.--*Paris*",
    "The temple of Solomon, for example, was not alone the binding of the holy book; it was the holy book itself.--*Paris*",
    "On each one of its concentric walls, the priests could read the word translated and manifested to the eye, and thus they followed its transformations from sanctuary to sanctuary, until they seized it in its last tabernacle, under its most concrete form, which still belonged to architecture: the arch.--*Paris*",
    "Thus the word was enclosed in an edifice, but its image was upon its envelope, like the human form on the coffin of a mummy.--*Paris*",
    "And not only the form of edifices, but the sites selected for them, revealed the thought which they represented, according as the symbol to be expressed was graceful or grave.--*Paris*",
    "Greece crowned her mountains with a temple harmonious to the eye; India disembowelled hers, to chisel therein those monstrous subterranean pagodas, borne up by gigantic rows of granite elephants.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, during the first six thousand years of the world, from the most immemorial pagoda of Hindustan, to the cathedral of Cologne, architecture was the great handwriting of the human race.--*Paris*",
    "And this is so true, that not only every religious symbol, but every human thought, has its page and its monument in that immense book.--*Paris*",
    "All civilization begins in theocracy and ends in democracy.--*Paris*",
    "This law of liberty following unity is written in architecture.--*Paris*",
    "For, let us insist upon this point, masonry must not be thought to be powerful only in erecting the temple and in expressing the myth and sacerdotal symbolism; in inscribing in hieroglyphs upon its pages of stone the mysterious tables of the law.--*Paris*",
    "If it were thus,--as there comes in all human society a moment when the sacred symbol is worn out and becomes obliterated under freedom of thought, when man escapes from the priest, when the excrescence of philosophies and systems devour the face of religion,--architecture could not reproduce this new state of human thought; its leaves, so crowded on the face, would be empty on the back; its work would be mutilated; its book would he incomplete.--*Paris*",
    "But no.--*Paris*",
    "Let us take as an example the Middle Ages, where we see more clearly because it is nearer to us.--*Paris*",
    "During its first period, while theocracy is organizing Europe, while the Vatican is rallying and reclassing about itself the elements of a Rome made from the Rome which lies in ruins around the Capitol, while Christianity is seeking all the stages of society amid the rubbish of anterior civilization, and rebuilding with its ruins a new hierarchic universe, the keystone to whose vault is the priest--one first hears a dull echo from that chaos, and then, little by little, one sees, arising from beneath the breath of Christianity, from beneath the hand of the barbarians, from the fragments of the dead Greek and Roman architectures, that mysterious Romanesque architecture, sister of the theocratic masonry of Egypt and of India, inalterable emblem of pure catholicism, unchangeable hieroglyph of the papal unity.--*Paris*",
    "All the thought of that day is written, in fact, in this sombre, Romanesque style.--*Paris*",
    "One feels everywhere in it authority, unity, the impenetrable, the absolute, Gregory VII.--*Paris*",
    "But the Crusades arrive.--*Paris*",
    "They are a great popular movement, and every great popular movement, whatever may be its cause and object, always sets free the spirit of liberty from its final precipitate.--*Paris*",
    "New things spring into life every day.--*Paris*",
    "Here opens the stormy period of the Jacqueries, Pragueries, and Leagues.--*Paris*",
    "Authority wavers, unity is divided.--*Paris*",
    "Feudalism demands to share with theocracy, while awaiting the inevitable arrival of the people, who will assume the part of the lion: ~Quia nominor leo~.--*Paris*",
    "Seignory pierces through sacerdotalism; the commonality, through seignory.--*Paris*",
    "The face of Europe is changed.--*Paris*",
    "Well!--*Paris*",
    "the face of architecture is changed also.--*Paris*",
    "Like civilization, it has turned a page, and the new spirit of the time finds her ready to write at its dictation.--*Paris*",
    "It returns from the crusades with the pointed arch, like the nations with liberty.--*Paris*",
    "Then, while Rome is undergoing gradual dismemberment, Romanesque architecture dies.--*Paris*",
    "The hieroglyph deserts the cathedral, and betakes itself to blazoning the donjon keep, in order to lend prestige to feudalism.--*Paris*",
    "The cathedral itself, that edifice formerly so dogmatic, invaded henceforth by the bourgeoisie, by the community, by liberty, escapes the priest and falls into the power of the artist.--*Paris*",
    "The artist builds it after his own fashion.--*Paris*",
    "Farewell to mystery, myth, law.--*Paris*",
    "Fancy and caprice, welcome.--*Paris*",
    "Provided the priest has his basilica and his altar, he has nothing to say.--*Paris*",
    "The four walls belong to the artist.--*Paris*",
    "The architectural book belongs no longer to the priest, to religion, to Rome; it is the property of poetry, of imagination, of the people.--*Paris*",
    "Hence the rapid and innumerable transformations of that architecture which owns but three centuries, so striking after the stagnant immobility of the Romanesque architecture, which owns six or seven.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, art marches on with giant strides.--*Paris*",
    "Popular genius amid originality accomplish the task which the bishops formerly fulfilled.--*Paris*",
    "Each race writes its line upon the book, as it passes; it erases the ancient Romanesque hieroglyphs on the frontispieces of cathedrals, and at the most one only sees dogma cropping out here and there, beneath the new symbol which it has deposited.--*Paris*",
    "The popular drapery hardly permits the religious skeleton to be suspected.--*Paris*",
    "One cannot even form an idea of the liberties which the architects then take, even toward the Church.--*Paris*",
    "There are capitals knitted of nuns and monks, shamelessly coupled, as on the hall of chimney pieces in the Palais de Justice, in Paris.--*Paris*",
    "There is Noah's adventure carved to the last detail, as under the great portal of Bourges.--*Paris*",
    "There is a bacchanalian monk, with ass's ears and glass in hand, laughing in the face of a whole community, as on the lavatory of the Abbey of Bocherville.--*Paris*",
    "There exists at that epoch, for thought written in stone, a privilege exactly comparable to our present liberty of the press.--*Paris*",
    "It is the liberty of architecture.--*Paris*",
    "This liberty goes very far.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes a portal, a fa?ade, an entire church, presents a symbolical sense absolutely foreign to worship, or even hostile to the Church.--*Paris*",
    "In the thirteenth century, Guillaume de Paris, and Nicholas Flamel, in the fifteenth, wrote such seditious pages.--*Paris*",
    "Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie was a whole church of the opposition.--*Paris*",
    "Thought was then free only in this manner; hence it never wrote itself out completely except on the books called edifices.--*Paris*",
    "Thought, under the form of edifice, could have beheld itself burned in the public square by the hands of the executioner, in its manuscript form, if it had been sufficiently imprudent to risk itself thus; thought, as the door of a church, would have been a spectator of the punishment of thought as a book.--*Paris*",
    "Having thus only this resource, masonry, in order to make its way to the light, flung itself upon it from all quarters.--*Paris*",
    "Hence the immense quantity of cathedrals which have covered Europe--a number so prodigious that one can hardly believe it even after having verified it.--*Paris*",
    "All the material forces, all the intellectual forces of society converged towards the same point: architecture.--*Paris*",
    "In this manner, under the pretext of building churches to God, art was developed in its magnificent proportions.--*Paris*",
    "Then whoever was born a poet became an architect.--*Paris*",
    "Genius, scattered in the masses, repressed in every quarter--*Paris*",
    "under feudalism as under a ~testudo~ of brazen bucklers, finding no issue except in the direction of architecture,--gushed forth through that art, and its Iliads assumed the form of cathedrals.--*Paris*",
    "All other arts obeyed, and placed themselves under the discipline of architecture.--*Paris*",
    "They were the workmen of the great work.--*Paris*",
    "The architect, the poet, the master, summed up in his person the sculpture which carved his fa?ades, painting which illuminated his windows, music which set his bells to pealing, and breathed into his organs.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing down to poor poetry,--properly speaking, that which persisted in vegetating in manuscripts,--which was not forced, in order to make something of itself, to come and frame itself in the edifice in the shape of a hymn or of prose; the same part, after all, which the tragedies of AEschylus had played in the sacerdotal festivals of Greece; Genesis, in the temple of Solomon.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, down to the time of Gutenberg, architecture is the principal writing, the universal writing.--*Paris*",
    "In that granite book, begun by the Orient, continued by Greek and Roman antiquity, the Middle Ages wrote the last page.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, this phenomenon of an architecture of the people following an architecture of caste, which we have just been observing in the Middle Ages, is reproduced with every analogous movement in the human intelligence at the other great epochs of history.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, in order to enunciate here only summarily, a law which it would require volumes to develop: in the high Orient, the cradle of primitive times, after Hindoo architecture came Phoenician architecture, that opulent mother of Arabian architecture; in antiquity, after Egyptian architecture, of which Etruscan style and cyclopean monuments are but one variety, came Greek architecture (of which the Roman style is only a continuation), surcharged with the Carthaginian dome; in modern times, after Romanesque architecture came Gothic architecture.--*Paris*",
    "And by separating there three series into their component parts, we shall find in the three eldest sisters, Hindoo architecture, Egyptian architecture, Romanesque architecture, the same symbol; that is to say, theocracy, caste, unity, dogma, myth, God: and for the three younger sisters, Phoenician architecture, Greek architecture, Gothic architecture, whatever, nevertheless, may be the diversity of form inherent in their nature, the same signification also; that is to say, liberty, the people, man.--*Paris*",
    "In the Hindu, Egyptian, or Romanesque architecture, one feels the priest, nothing but the priest, whether he calls himself Brahmin, Magian, or Pope.--*Paris*",
    "It is not the same in the architectures of the people.--*Paris*",
    "They are richer and less sacred.--*Paris*",
    "In the Phoenician, one feels the merchant; in the Greek, the republican; in the Gothic, the citizen.--*Paris*",
    "The general characteristics of all theocratic architecture are immutability, horror of progress, the preservation of traditional lines, the consecration of the primitive types, the constant bending of all the forms of men and of nature to the incomprehensible caprices of the symbol.--*Paris*",
    "These are dark books, which the initiated alone understand how to decipher.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, every form, every deformity even, has there a sense which renders it inviolable.--*Paris*",
    "Do not ask of Hindoo, Egyptian, Romanesque masonry to reform their design, or to improve their statuary.--*Paris*",
    "Every attempt at perfecting is an impiety to them.--*Paris*",
    "In these architectures it seems as though the rigidity of the dogma had spread over the stone like a sort of second petrifaction.--*Paris*",
    "The general characteristics of popular masonry, on the contrary, are progress, originality, opulence, perpetual movement.--*Paris*",
    "They are already sufficiently detached from religion to think of their beauty, to take care of it, to correct without relaxation their parure of statues or arabesques.--*Paris*",
    "They are of the age.--*Paris*",
    "They have something human, which they mingle incessantly with the divine symbol under which they still produce.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, edifices comprehensible to every soul, to every intelligence, to every imagination, symbolical still, but as easy to understand as nature.--*Paris*",
    "Between theocratic architecture and this there is the difference that lies between a sacred language and a vulgar language, between hieroglyphics and art, between Solomon and Phidias.--*Paris*",
    "If the reader will sum up what we have hitherto briefly, very briefly, indicated, neglecting a thousand proofs and also a thousand objections of detail, be will be led to this: that architecture was, down to the fifteenth century, the chief register of humanity; that in that interval not a thought which is in any degree complicated made its appearance in the world, which has not been worked into an edifice; that every popular idea, and every religious law, has had its monumental records; that the human race has, in short, had no important thought which it has not written in stone.--*Paris*",
    "And why?--*Paris*",
    "Because every thought, either philosophical or religious, is interested in perpetuating itself; because the idea which has moved one generation wishes to move others also, and leave a trace.--*Paris*",
    "Now, what a precarious immortality is that of the manuscript!--*Paris*",
    "How much more solid, durable, unyielding, is a book of stone!--*Paris*",
    "In order to destroy the written word, a torch and a Turk are sufficient.--*Paris*",
    "To demolish the constructed word, a social revolution, a terrestrial revolution are required.--*Paris*",
    "The barbarians passed over the Coliseum; the deluge, perhaps, passed over the Pyramids.--*Paris*",
    "In the fifteenth century everything changes.--*Paris*",
    "Human thought discovers a mode of perpetuating itself, not only more durable and more resisting than architecture, but still more simple and easy.--*Paris*",
    "Architecture is dethroned.--*Paris*",
    "Gutenberg's letters of lead are about to supersede Orpheus's letters of stone.--*Paris*",
    "The invention of printing is the greatest event in history.--*Paris*",
    "It is the mother of revolution.--*Paris*",
    "It is the mode of expression of humanity which is totally renewed; it is human thought stripping off one form and donning another; it is the complete and definitive change of skin of that symbolical serpent which since the days of Adam has represented intelligence.--*Paris*",
    "In its printed form, thought is more imperishable than ever; it is volatile, irresistible, indestructible.--*Paris*",
    "It is mingled with the air.--*Paris*",
    "In the days of architecture it made a mountain of itself, and took powerful possession of a century and a place.--*Paris*",
    "Now it converts itself into a flock of birds, scatters itself to the four winds, and occupies all points of air and space at once.--*Paris*",
    "We repeat, who does not perceive that in this form it is far more indelible?--*Paris*",
    "It was solid, it has become alive.--*Paris*",
    "It passes from duration in time to immortality.--*Paris*",
    "One can demolish a mass; bow can one extirpate ubiquity?--*Paris*",
    "If a flood comes, the mountains will have long disappeared beneath the waves, while the birds will still be flying about; and if a single ark floats on the surface of the cataclysm, they will alight upon it, will float with it, will be present with it at the ebbing of the waters; and the new world which emerges from this chaos will behold, on its awakening, the thought of the world which has been submerged soaring above it, winged and living.--*Paris*",
    "And when one observes that this mode of expression is not only the most conservative, but also the most simple, the most convenient, the most practicable for all; when one reflects that it does not drag after it bulky baggage, and does not set in motion a heavy apparatus; when one compares thought forced, in order to transform itself into an edifice, to put in motion four or five other arts and tons of gold, a whole mountain of stones, a whole forest of timber-work, a whole nation of workmen; when one compares it to the thought which becomes a book, and for which a little paper, a little ink, and a pen suffice,--how can one be surprised that human intelligence should have quitted architecture for printing?--*Paris*",
    "Cut the primitive bed of a river abruptly with a canal hollowed out below its level, and the river will desert its bed.--*Paris*",
    "Behold how, beginning with the discovery of printing, architecture withers away little by little, becomes lifeless and bare.--*Paris*",
    "How one feels the water sinking, the sap departing, the thought of the times and of the people withdrawing from it!--*Paris*",
    "The chill is almost imperceptible in the fifteenth century; the press is, as yet, too weak, and, at the most, draws from powerful architecture a superabundance of life.--*Paris*",
    "But practically beginning with the sixteenth century, the malady of architecture is visible; it is no longer the expression of society; it becomes classic art in a miserable manner; from being Gallic, European, indigenous, it becomes Greek and Roman; from being true and modern, it becomes pseudo-classic.--*Paris*",
    "It is this decadence which is called the Renaissance.--*Paris*",
    "A magnificent decadence, however, for the ancient Gothic genius, that sun which sets behind the gigantic press of Mayence, still penetrates for a while longer with its rays that whole hybrid pile of Latin arcades and Corinthian columns.--*Paris*",
    "It is that setting sun which we mistake for the dawn.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, from the moment when architecture is no longer anything but an art like any other; as soon as it is no longer the total art, the sovereign art, the tyrant art,--it has no longer the power to retain the other arts.--*Paris*",
    "So they emancipate themselves, break the yoke of the architect, and take themselves off, each one in its own direction.--*Paris*",
    "Each one of them gains by this divorce.--*Paris*",
    "Isolation aggrandizes everything.--*Paris*",
    "Sculpture becomes statuary, the image trade becomes painting, the canon becomes music.--*Paris*",
    "One would pronounce it an empire dismembered at the death of its Alexander, and whose provinces become kingdoms.--*Paris*",
    "Hence Raphael, Michael Angelo, Jean Goujon, Palestrina, those splendors of the dazzling sixteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "Thought emancipates itself in all directions at the same time as the arts.--*Paris*",
    "The arch-heretics of the Middle Ages had already made large incisions into Catholicism.--*Paris*",
    "The sixteenth century breaks religious unity.--*Paris*",
    "Before the invention of printing, reform would have been merely a schism; printing converted it into a revolution.--*Paris*",
    "Take away the press; heresy is enervated.--*Paris*",
    "Whether it be Providence or Fate, Gutenburg is the precursor of Luther.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, when the sun of the Middle Ages is completely set, when the Gothic genius is forever extinct upon the horizon, architecture grows dim, loses its color, becomes more and more effaced.--*Paris*",
    "The printed book, the gnawing worm of the edifice, sucks and devours it.--*Paris*",
    "It becomes bare, denuded of its foliage, and grows visibly emaciated.--*Paris*",
    "It is petty, it is poor, it is nothing.--*Paris*",
    "It no longer expresses anything, not even the memory of the art of another time.--*Paris*",
    "Reduced to itself, abandoned by the other arts, because human thought is abandoning it, it summons bunglers in place of artists.--*Paris*",
    "Glass replaces the painted windows.--*Paris*",
    "The stone-cutter succeeds the sculptor.--*Paris*",
    "Farewell all sap, all originality, all life, all intelligence.--*Paris*",
    "It drags along, a lamentable workshop mendicant, from copy to copy.--*Paris*",
    "Michael Angelo, who, no doubt, felt even in the sixteenth century that it was dying, had a last idea, an idea of despair.--*Paris*",
    "That Titan of art piled the Pantheon on the Parthenon, and made Saint-Peter's at Rome.--*Paris*",
    "A great work, which deserved to remain unique, the last originality of architecture, the signature of a giant artist at the bottom of the colossal register of stone which was closed forever.--*Paris*",
    "With Michael Angelo dead, what does this miserable architecture, which survived itself in the state of a spectre, do?--*Paris*",
    "It takes Saint-Peter in Rome, copies it and parodies it.--*Paris*",
    "It is a mania.--*Paris*",
    "It is a pity.--*Paris*",
    "Each century has its Saint-Peter's of Rome; in the seventeenth century, the Val-de-Grace; in the eighteenth, Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "Each country has its Saint-Peter's of Rome.--*Paris*",
    "London has one; Petersburg has another; Paris has two or three.--*Paris*",
    "The insignificant testament, the last dotage of a decrepit grand art falling back into infancy before it dies.--*Paris*",
    "If, in place of the characteristic monuments which we have just described, we examine the general aspect of art from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, we notice the same phenomena of decay and phthisis.--*Paris*",
    "Beginning with Fran?ois II., the architectural form of the edifice effaces itself more and more, and allows the geometrical form, like the bony structure of an emaciated invalid, to become prominent.--*Paris*",
    "The fine lines of art give way to the cold and inexorable lines of geometry.--*Paris*",
    "An edifice is no longer an edifice; it is a polyhedron.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, architecture is tormented in her struggles to conceal this nudity.--*Paris*",
    "Look at the Greek pediment inscribed upon the Roman pediment, and vice versa.--*Paris*",
    "It is still the Pantheon on the Parthenon: Saint-Peter's of Rome.--*Paris*",
    "Here are the brick houses of Henri IV., with their stone corners; the Place Royale, the Place Dauphine.--*Paris*",
    "Here are the churches of Louis XIII., heavy, squat, thickset, crowded together, loaded with a dome like a hump.--*Paris*",
    "Here is the Mazarin architecture, the wretched Italian pasticcio of the Four Nations.--*Paris*",
    "Here are the palaces of Louis XIV., long barracks for courtiers, stiff, cold, tiresome.--*Paris*",
    "Here, finally, is Louis XV., with chiccory leaves and vermicelli, and all the warts, and all the fungi, which disfigure that decrepit, toothless, and coquettish old architecture.--*Paris*",
    "From Fran?ois II.--*Paris*",
    "to Louis XV., the evil has increased in geometrical progression.--*Paris*",
    "Art has no longer anything but skin upon its bones.--*Paris*",
    "It is miserably perishing.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile what becomes of printing?--*Paris*",
    "All the life which is leaving architecture comes to it.--*Paris*",
    "In proportion as architecture ebbs, printing swells and grows.--*Paris*",
    "That capital of forces which human thought had been expending in edifices, it henceforth expends in books.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, from the sixteenth century onward, the press, raised to the level of decaying architecture, contends with it and kills it.--*Paris*",
    "In the seventeenth century it is already sufficiently the sovereign, sufficiently triumphant, sufficiently established in its victory, to give to the world the feast of a great literary century.--*Paris*",
    "In the eighteenth, having reposed for a long time at the Court of Louis XIV., it seizes again the old sword of Luther, puts it into the hand of Voltaire, and rushes impetuously to the attack of that ancient Europe, whose architectural expression it has already killed.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when the eighteenth century comes to an end, it has destroyed everything.--*Paris*",
    "In the nineteenth, it begins to reconstruct.--*Paris*",
    "Now, we ask, which of the three arts has really represented human thought for the last three centuries?--*Paris*",
    "which translates it?--*Paris*",
    "which expresses not only its literary and scholastic vagaries, but its vast, profound, universal movement?--*Paris*",
    "which constantly superposes itself, without a break, without a gap, upon the human race, which walks a monster with a thousand legs?--Architecture or printing?--*Paris*",
    "It is printing.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader make no mistake; architecture is dead; irretrievably slain by the printed book,--slain because it endures for a shorter time,--slain because it costs more.--*Paris*",
    "Every cathedral represents millions.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader now imagine what an investment of funds it would require to rewrite the architectural book; to cause thousands of edifices to swarm once more upon the soil; to return to those epochs when the throng of monuments was such, according to the statement of an eye witness, \"that one would have said that the world in shaking itself, had cast off its old garments in order to cover itself with a white vesture of churches.\"--*Paris*",
    "A book is so soon made, costs so little, and can go so far!--*Paris*",
    "How can it surprise us that all human thought flows in this channel?--*Paris*",
    "This does not mean that architecture will not still have a fine monument, an isolated masterpiece, here and there.--*Paris*",
    "We may still have from time to time, under the reign of printing, a column made I suppose, by a whole army from melted cannon, as we had under the reign of architecture, Iliads and Romanceros, Mahabahrata, and Nibelungen Lieds, made by a whole people, with rhapsodies piled up and melted together.--*Paris*",
    "The great accident of an architect of genius may happen in the twentieth century, like that of Dante in the thirteenth.--*Paris*",
    "But architecture will no longer be the social art, the collective art, the dominating art.--*Paris*",
    "The grand poem, the grand edifice, the grand work of humanity will no longer be built: it will be printed.--*Paris*",
    "And henceforth, if architecture should arise again accidentally, it will no longer be mistress.--*Paris*",
    "It will be subservient to the law of literature, which formerly received the law from it.--*Paris*",
    "The respective positions of the two arts will be inverted.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that in architectural epochs, the poems, rare it is true, resemble the monuments.--*Paris*",
    "In India, Vyasa is branching, strange, impenetrable as a pagoda.--*Paris*",

    "The Bible resembles the Pyramids; the Iliad, the Parthenon; Homer, Phidias.--*Paris*",
    "Dante in the thirteenth century is the last Romanesque church; Shakespeare in the sixteenth, the last Gothic cathedral.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, to sum up what we have hitherto said, in a fashion which is necessarily incomplete and mutilated, the human race has two books, two registers, two testaments: masonry and printing; the Bible of stone and the Bible of paper.--*Paris*",
    "No doubt, when one contemplates these two Bibles, laid so broadly open in the centuries, it is permissible to regret the visible majesty of the writing of granite, those gigantic alphabets formulated in colonnades, in pylons, in obelisks, those sorts of human mountains which cover the world and the past, from the pyramid to the bell tower, from Cheops to Strasburg.--*Paris*",
    "The past must be reread upon these pages of marble.--*Paris*",
    "This book, written by architecture, must be admired and perused incessantly; but the grandeur of the edifice which printing erects in its turn must not be denied.--*Paris*",
    "That edifice is colossal.--*Paris*",
    "Some compiler of statistics has calculated, that if all the volumes which have issued from the press since Gutenberg's day were to be piled one upon another, they would fill the space between the earth and the moon; but it is not that sort of grandeur of which we wished to speak.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, when one tries to collect in one's mind a comprehensive image of the total products of printing down to our own days, does not that total appear to us like an immense construction, resting upon the entire world, at which humanity toils without relaxation, and whose monstrous crest is lost in the profound mists of the future?--*Paris*",
    "It is the anthill of intelligence.--*Paris*",
    "It is the hive whither come all imaginations, those golden bees, with their honey.--*Paris*",
    "The edifice has a thousand stories.--*Paris*",

    "There, every individual work, however capricious and isolated it may seem, has its place and its projection.--*Paris*",
    "Harmony results from the whole.--*Paris*",
    "From the cathedral of Shakespeare to the mosque of Byron, a thousand tiny bell towers are piled pell-mell above this metropolis of universal thought.--*Paris*",
    "At its base are written some ancient titles of humanity which architecture had not registered.--*Paris*",
    "To the left of the entrance has been fixed the ancient bas-relief, in white marble, of Homer; to the right, the polyglot Bible rears its seven heads.--*Paris*",
    "The hydra of the Romancero and some other hybrid forms, the Vedas and the Nibelungen bristle further on.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, the prodigious edifice still remains incomplete.--*Paris*",

    "Book 6 Chapter 1 An Impartial Glance At The Ancient Magistrac--*Paris*",
    "A very happy personage in the year of grace 1482, was the noble gentleman Robert d'Estouteville, chevalier, Sieur de Beyne, Baron d'Ivry and Saint Andry en la Marche, counsellor and chamberlain to the king, and guard of the provostship of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "It was already nearly seventeen years since he had received from the king, on November 7, 1465, the comet year,* that fine charge of the provostship of Paris, which was reputed rather a seigneury than an office.--*Paris*",
    "The same day on which Robert d'Estouteville took the place of Jacques de Villiers in the provostship of Paris, Master Jehan Dauvet replaced Messire Helye de Thorrettes in the first presidency of the Court of Parliament, Jehan Jouvenel des Ursins supplanted Pierre de Morvilliers in the office of chancellor of France, Regnault des Dormans ousted Pierre Puy from the charge of master of requests in ordinary of the king's household.--*Paris*",
    "Now, upon how many heads had the presidency, the chancellorship, the mastership passed since Robert d'Estouteville had held the provostship of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "It had been \"granted to him for safekeeping,\" as the letters patent said; and certainly he kept it well.--*Paris*",
    "He had clung to it, he had incorporated himself with it, he had so identified himself with it that he had escaped that fury for change which possessed Louis XI., a tormenting and industrious king, whose policy it was to maintain the elasticity of his power by frequent appointments and revocations.--*Paris*",
    "More than this; the brave chevalier had obtained the reversion of the office for his son, and for two years already, the name of the noble man Jacques d'Estouteville, equerry, had figured beside his at the head of the register of the salary list of the provostship of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "A rare and notable favor indeed!--*Paris*",
    "It is true that Robert d'Estouteville was a good soldier, that he had loyally raised his pennon against \"the league of public good,\" and that he had presented to the queen a very marvellous stag in confectionery on the day of her entrance to Paris in 14...--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he possessed the good friendship of Messire Tristan l'Hermite, provost of the marshals of the king's household.--*Paris*",
    "Hence a very sweet and pleasant existence was that of Messire Robert.--*Paris*",
    "In the first place, very good wages, to which were attached, and from which hung, like extra bunches of grapes on his vine, the revenues of the civil and criminal registries of the provostship, plus the civil and criminal revenues of the tribunals of Embas of the Chatelet, without reckoning some little toll from the bridges of Mantes and of Corbeil, and the profits on the craft of Shagreen-makers of Paris, on the corders of firewood and the measurers of salt.--*Paris*",
    "Add to this the pleasure of displaying himself in rides about the city, and of making his fine military costume, which you may still admire sculptured on his tomb in the abbey of Valmont in Normandy, and his morion, all embossed at Montlh\u00e9ry, stand out a contrast against the parti-colored red and tawny robes of the aldermen and police.--*Paris*",
    "And then, was it nothing to wield absolute supremacy over the sergeants of the police, the porter and watch of the Chatelet, the two auditors of the Chatelet, ~auditores castelleti~, the sixteen commissioners of the sixteen quarters, the jailer of the Chatelet, the four enfeoffed sergeants, the hundred and twenty mounted sergeants, with maces, the chevalier of the watch with his watch, his sub-watch, his counter-watch and his rear-watch?--*Paris*",
    "Was it nothing to exercise high and low justice, the right to interrogate, to hang and to draw, without reckoning petty jurisdiction in the first resort (~in prima instantia~, as the charters say), on that viscomty of Paris, so nobly appanaged with seven noble bailiwicks?--*Paris*",
    "Can anything sweeter be imagined than rendering judgments and decisions, as Messire Robert d'Estouteville daily did in the Grand Chatelet, under the large and flattened arches of Philip Augustus?--*Paris*",
    "and going, as he was wont to do every evening, to that charming house situated in the Rue Galilee, in the enclosure of the royal palace, which he held in right of his wife, Madame Ambroise de Lore, to repose after the fatigue of having sent some poor wretch to pass the night in \"that little cell of the Rue de Escorcherie, which the provosts and aldermen of Paris used to make their prison; the same being eleven feet long, seven feet and four inches wide, and eleven feet high?--*Paris*",
    "And not only had Messire Robert d'Estouteville his special court as provost and vicomte of Paris; but in addition he had a share, both for eye and tooth, in the grand court of the king.--*Paris*",
    "There was no head in the least elevated which had not passed through his hands before it came to the headsman.--*Paris*",
    "It was he who went to seek M. de Nemours at the Bastille Saint Antoine, in order to conduct him to the Halles; and to conduct to the Gr\u00e8ve M. de Saint-Pol, who clamored and resisted, to the great joy of the provost, who did not love monsieur the constable.--*Paris*",
    "Here, assuredly, is more than sufficient to render a life happy and illustrious, and to deserve some day a notable page in that interesting history of the provosts of Paris, where one learns that Oudard de Villeneuve had a house in the Rue des Boucheries, that Guillaume de Hangest purchased the great and the little Savoy, that Guillaume Thiboust gave the nuns of Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve his houses in the Rue Clopin, that Hugues Aubriot lived in the H?tel du Pore-Epic, and other domestic facts.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, with so many reasons for taking life patiently and joyously, Messire Robert d'Estouteville woke up on the morning of the seventh of January, 1482, in a very surly and peevish mood.--*Paris*",
    "Whence came this ill temper?--*Paris*",
    "He could not have told himself.--*Paris*",
    "Was it because the sky was gray?--*Paris*",
    "or was the buckle of his old belt of Montlh\u00e9ry badly fastened, so that it confined his provostal portliness too closely?--*Paris*",
    "had he beheld ribald fellows, marching in bands of four, beneath his window, and setting him at defiance, in doublets but no shirts, hats without crowns, with wallet and bottle at their side?--*Paris*",
    "Was it a vague presentiment of the three hundred and seventy livres, sixteen sous, eight farthings, which the future King Charles VII.--*Paris*",
    "was to cut off from the provostship in the following year?--*Paris*",
    "The reader can take his choice; we, for our part, are much inclined to believe that he was in a bad humor, simply because he was in a bad humor.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, it was the day after a festival, a tiresome day for every one, and above all for the magistrate who is charged with sweeping away all the filth, properly and figuratively speaking, which a festival day produces in Paris.--*Paris*",
    "And then he had to hold a sitting at the Grand Chatelet.--*Paris*",
    "Now, we have noticed that judges in general so arrange matters that their day of audience shall also be their day of bad humor, so that they may always have some one upon whom to vent it conveniently, in the name of the king, law, and justice.--*Paris*",
    "However, the audience had begun without him.--*Paris*",
    "His lieutenants, civil, criminal, and private, were doing his work, according to usage; and from eight o'clock in the morning, some scores of bourgeois and ~bourgeoises~, heaped and crowded into an obscure corner of the audience chamber of Embas du Chatelet, between a stout oaken barrier and the wall, had been gazing blissfully at the varied and cheerful spectacle of civil and criminal justice dispensed by Master Florian Barbedienne,--*Paris*",
    "auditor of the Chatelet, lieutenant of monsieur the provost, in a somewhat confused and utterly haphazard manner.--*Paris*",
    "The hall was small, low, vaulted.--*Paris*",
    "A table studded with fleurs-de-lis stood at one end, with a large arm-chair of carved oak, which belonged to the provost and was empty, and a stool on the left for the auditor, Master Florian.--*Paris*",
    "Below sat the clerk of the court, scribbling; opposite was the populace; and in front of the door, and in front of the table were many sergeants of the provostship in sleeveless jackets of violet camlet, with white crosses.--*Paris*",
    "Two sergeants of the Parloir- aux-Bourgeois, clothed in their jackets of Toussaint, half red, half blue, were posted as sentinels before a low, closed door, which was visible at the extremity of the hall, behind the table.--*Paris*",
    "A single pointed window, narrowly encased in the thick wall, illuminated with a pale ray of January sun two grotesque figures,--the capricious demon of stone carved as a tail-piece in the keystone of the vaulted ceiling, and the judge seated at the end of the hall on the fleurs-de-lis.--*Paris*",
    "Imagine, in fact, at the provost's table, leaning upon his elbows between two bundles of documents of cases, with his foot on the train of his robe of plain brown cloth, his face buried in his hood of white lamb's skin, of which his brows seemed to be of a piece, red, crabbed, winking, bearing majestically the load of fat on his cheeks which met under his chin, Master Florian Barbedienne, auditor of the Chatelet.--*Paris*",
    "Now, the auditor was deaf.--*Paris*",
    "A slight defect in an auditor.--*Paris*",
    "Master Florian delivered judgment, none the less, without appeal and very suitably.--*Paris*",
    "It is certainly quite sufficient for a judge to have the .air of listening; and the venerable auditor fulfilled this condition, the sole one in justice, all the better because his attention could not be distracted by any noise.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he had in the audience, a pitiless censor of his deeds and gestures, in the person of our friend Jehan Frollo du Moulin, that little student of yesterday, that \"stroller,\" whom one was sure of encountering all over Paris, anywhere except before the rostrums of the professors.--*Paris*",
    "It was he indeed.--*Paris*",
    "It was Quasimodo, bound, encircled, roped, pinioned, and under good guard.--*Paris*",
    "The squad of policemen who surrounded him was assisted by the chevalier of the watch in person, wearing the arms of France embroidered on his breast, and the arms of the city on his back.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing, however, about Quasimodo, except his deformity, which could justify the display of halberds and arquebuses; he was gloomy, silent, and tranquil.--*Paris*",
    "Only now and then did his single eye cast a sly and wrathful glance upon the bonds with which he was loaded.--*Paris*",
    "He cast the same glance about him, but it was so dull and sleepy that the women only pointed him out to each other in derision.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile Master Florian, the auditor, turned over attentively the document in the complaint entered against Quasimodo, which the clerk handed him, and, having thus glanced at it, appeared to reflect for a moment.--*Paris*",
    "Thanks to this precaution, which he always was careful to take at the moment when on the point of beginning an examination, he knew beforehand the names, titles, and misdeeds of the accused, made cut and dried responses to questions foreseen, and succeeded in extricating himself from all the windings of the interrogation without allowing his deafness to be too apparent.--*Paris*",
    "The written charges were to him what the dog is to the blind man.--*Paris*",
    "If his deafness did happen to betray him here and there, by some incoherent apostrophe or some unintelligible question, it passed for profundity with some, and for imbecility with others.--*Paris*",
    "In neither case did the honor of the magistracy sustain any injury; for it is far better that a judge should be reputed imbecile or profound than deaf.--*Paris*",
    "Hence he took great care to conceal his deafness from the eyes of all, and he generally succeeded so well that he had reached the point of deluding himself, which is, by the way, easier than is supposed.--*Paris*",
    "All hunchbacks walk with their heads held high, all stutterers harangue, all deaf people speak low.--*Paris*",
    "As for him, he believed, at the most, that his ear was a little refractory.--*Paris*",
    "It was the sole concession which he made on this point to public opinion, in his moments of frankness and examination of his conscience.--*Paris*",
    "Having, then, thoroughly ruminated Quasimodo's affair, he threw back his head and half closed his eyes, for the sake of more majesty and impartiality, so that, at that moment, he was both deaf and blind.--*Paris*",
    "A double condition, without which no judge is perfect.--*Paris*",
    "It was in this magisterial attitude that he began the examination.--*Paris*",
    "Now this was a case which had not been \"provided for by law,\" where a deaf man should be obliged to question a deaf man.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, whom nothing warned that a question had been addressed to him, continued to stare intently at the judge, and made no reply.--*Paris*",
    "The judge, being deaf, and being in no way warned of the deafness of the accused, thought that the latter had answered, as all accused do in general, and therefore he pursued, with his mechanical and stupid self-possession,----*Paris*",
    "Again Quasimodo made no reply to this question.--*Paris*",
    "The judge supposed that it had been replied to, and continued,----*Paris*",
    "Still the same silence.--*Paris*",
    "The spectators had begun, meanwhile, to whisper together, and to exchange glances.--*Paris*",
    "At this unlucky question, a burst of laughter rose from the clerk's table caught by the audience, so violent, so wild, so contagious, so universal, that the two deaf men were forced to perceive it.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo turned round, shrugging his hump with disdain, while Master Florian, equally astonished, and supposing that the laughter of the spectators had been provoked by some irreverent reply from the accused, rendered visible to him by that shrug of the shoulders, apostrophized him indignantly,----*Paris*",
    "This sally was not fitted to arrest the explosion of general merriment.--*Paris*",
    "It struck all as so whimsical, and so ridiculous, that the wild laughter even attacked the sergeants of the Parloi- aux-Bourgeois, a sort of pikemen, whose stupidity was part of their uniform.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo alone preserved his seriousness, for the good reason that he understood nothing of what was going on around him.--*Paris*",
    "The judge, more and more irritated, thought it his duty to continue in the same tone, hoping thereby to strike the accused with a terror which should react upon the audience, and bring it back to respect.--*Paris*",
    "There is no reason why a deaf man talking to a deaf man should stop.--*Paris*",
    "God knows where and when Master Florian would have landed, when thus launched at full speed in lofty eloquence, if the low door at the extreme end of the room had not suddenly opened, and given entrance to the provost in person.--*Paris*",
    "At his entrance Master Florian did not stop short, but, making a half-turn on his heels, and aiming at the provost the harangue with which he had been withering Quasimodo a moment before,----*Paris*",
    "And he seated himself, utterly breathless, wiping away the great drops of sweat which fell from his brow and drenched, like tears, the parchments spread out before him.--*Paris*",
    "Messire Robert d'Estouteville frowned and made a gesture so imperious and significant to Quasimodo, that the deaf man in some measure understood it.--*Paris*",
    "The provost addressed him with severity, \"What have you done that you have been brought hither, knave?\"--*Paris*",
    "The poor fellow, supposing that the provost was asking his name, broke the silence which he habitually preserved, and replied, in a harsh and guttural voice, \"Quasimodo.\"--*Paris*",
    "The reply matched the question so little that the wild laugh began to circulate once more, and Messire Robert exclaimed, red with wrath,----*Paris*",
    "This was too much; the provost could no longer restrain himself.--*Paris*",
    "The clerk set to work incontinently to draw up the account of the sentence.--*Paris*",
    "The provost turned and fixed his flashing eyes once more on Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "In a few minutes the sentence was drawn up.--*Paris*",
    "Its tenor was simple and brief.--*Paris*",
    "The customs of the provostship and the viscomty had not yet been worked over by President Thibaut Baillet, and by Roger Barmne, the king's advocate; they had not been obstructed, at that time, by that lofty hedge of quibbles and procedures, which the two jurisconsults planted there at the beginning of the sixteenth century.--*Paris*",
    "All was clear, expeditious, explicit.--*Paris*",
    "One went straight to the point then, and at the end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and without turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory.--*Paris*",
    "One at least knew whither one was going.--*Paris*",
    "The clerk presented the sentence to the provost, who affixed his seal to it, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame of mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in Paris that day.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan Frollo and Robin Poussepain laughed in their sleeves.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo gazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.--*Paris*",
    "However, at the moment when Master Florian Barbedienne was reading the sentence in his turn, before signing it, the clerk felt himself moved with pity for the poor wretch of a prisoner, and, in the hope of obtaining some mitigation of the penalty, he approached as near the auditor's ear as possible, and said, pointing to Quasimodo, \"That man is deaf.\"--*Paris*",
    "He hoped that this community of infirmity would awaken Master Florian's interest in behalf of the condemned man.--*Paris*",
    "But, in the first place, we have already observed that Master Florian did not care to have his deafness noticed.--*Paris*",
    "In the next place, he was so hard of hearing That he did not catch a single word of what the clerk said to him; nevertheless, he wished to have the appearance of hearing, and replied, \"Ah!--*Paris*",
    "ah!--*Paris*",
    "that is different; I did not know that.--*Paris*",
    "An hour more of the pillory, in that case.\"--*Paris*",
    "And he signed the sentence thus modified.--*Paris*",
    "Book 6 Chapter 2 The Rat-hole--*Paris*",
    "The reader must permit us to take him back to the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, which we quitted yesterday with Gringoire, in order to follow la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "It is ten o'clock in the morning; everything is indicative of the day after a festival.--*Paris*",
    "The pavement is covered with rubbish; ribbons, rags, feathers from tufts of plumes, drops of wax from the torches, crumbs of the public feast.--*Paris*",
    "A goodly number of bourgeois are \"sauntering,\" as we say, here and there, turning over with their feet the extinct brands of the bonfire, going into raptures in front of the Pillar House, over the memory of the fine hangings of the day before, and to-day staring at the nails that secured them a last pleasure.--*Paris*",
    "The venders of cider and beer are rolling their barrels among the groups.--*Paris*",
    "Some busy passers-by come and go.--*Paris*",
    "The merchants converse and call to each other from the thresholds of their shops.--*Paris*",
    "The festival, the ambassadors, Coppenole, the Pope of the Fools, are in all mouths; they vie with each other, each trying to criticise it best and laugh the most.--*Paris*",
    "And, meanwhile, four mounted sergeants, who have just posted themselves at the four sides of the pillory, have already concentrated around themselves a goodly proportion of the populace scattered on the Place, who condemn themselves to immobility and fatigue in the hope of a small execution.--*Paris*",
    "If the reader, after having contemplated this lively and noisy scene which is being enacted in all parts of the Place, will now transfer his gaze towards that ancient demi-Gothic, demi-Romanesque house of the Tour-Roland, which forms the corner on the quay to the west, he will observe, at the angle of the fa?ade, a large public breviary, with rich illuminations, protected from the rain by a little penthouse, and from thieves by a small grating, which, however, permits of the leaves being turned.--*Paris*",
    "Beside this breviary is a narrow, arched window, closed by two iron bars in the form of a cross, and looking on the square; the only opening which admits a small quantity of light and air to a little cell without a door, constructed on the ground-floor, in the thickness of the walls of the old house, and filled with a peace all the more profound, with a silence all the more gloomy, because a public place, the most populous and most noisy in Paris swarms and shrieks around it.--*Paris*",
    "This little cell had been celebrated in Paris for nearly three centuries, ever since Madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, in mourning for her father who died in the Crusades, had caused it to be hollowed out in the wall of her own house, in order to immure herself there forever, keeping of all her palace only this lodging whose door was walled up, and whose window stood open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to the poor and to God.--*Paris*",
    "The afflicted damsel had, in fact, waited twenty years for death in this premature tomb, praying night and day for the soul of her father, sleeping in ashes, without even a stone for a pillow, clothed in a black sack, and subsisting on the bread and water which the compassion of the passers-by led them to deposit on the ledge of her window, thus receiving charity after having bestowed it.--*Paris*",
    "At her death, at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre, she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women, mothers, widows, or maidens, who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves, and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance.--*Paris*",
    "The poor of her day had made her a fine funeral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the pious maid had not been canonized, for lack of influence.--*Paris*",
    "Those among them who were a little inclined to impiety, had hoped that the matter might be accomplished in Paradise more easily than at Rome, and had frankly besought God, instead of the pope, in behalf of the deceased.--*Paris*",
    "The majority had contented themselves with holding the memory of Rolande sacred, and converting her rags into relics.--*Paris*",
    "The city, on its side, had founded in honor of the damoiselle, a public breviary, which had been fastened near the window of the cell, in order that passers-by might halt there from time to time, were it only to pray; that prayer might remind them of alms, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of Madame Rolande's vault, might not die outright of hunger and forgetfulness.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, this sort of tomb was not so very rare a thing in the cities of the Middle Ages.--*Paris*",
    "One often encountered in the most frequented street, in the most crowded and noisy market, in the very middle, under the feet of the horses, under the wheels of the carts, as it were, a cellar, a well, a tiny walled and grated cabin, at the bottom of which a human being prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal lamentation, to some great expiation.--*Paris*",
    "And all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb, the cemetery and the city; that living being cut off from the human community, and thenceforth reckoned among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness; that remnant of life flickering in the grave; that breath, that voice, that eternal prayer in a box of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illuminated with another sun; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb; that soul a prisoner in that body; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell, and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite, the murmur of that soul in pain;--nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "The piety of that age, not very subtle nor much given to reasoning, did not see so many facets in an act of religion.--*Paris*",
    "It took the thing in the block, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not analyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them.--*Paris*",
    "It brought some pittance to the miserable penitent from time to time, looked through the hole to see whether he were still living, forgot his name, hardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die, and to the stranger, who questioned them about the living skeleton who was perishing in that cellar, the neighbors replied simply, \"It is the recluse.\"--*Paris*",
    "Everything was then viewed without metaphysics, without exaggeration, without magnifying glass, with the naked eye.--*Paris*",
    "The microscope had not yet been invented, either for things of matter or for things of the mind.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, although people were but little surprised by it, the examples of this sort of cloistration in the hearts of cities were in truth frequent, as we have just said.--*Paris*",
    "There were in Paris a considerable number of these cells, for praying to God and doing penance; they were nearly all occupied.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that the clergy did not like to have them empty, since that implied lukewarmness in believers, and that lepers were put into them when there were no penitents on hand.--*Paris*",
    "Besides the cell on the Gr\u00e8ve, there was one at Montfau?on, one at the Charnier des Innocents, another I hardly know where,--at the Clichon House, I think; others still at many spots where traces of them are found in traditions, in default of memorials.--*Paris*",
    "The University had also its own.--*Paris*",
    "On Mount Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve a sort of Job of the Middle Ages, for the space of thirty years, chanted the seven penitential psalms on a dunghill at the bottom of a cistern, beginning anew when he had finished, singing loudest at night, ~magna voce per umbras~, and to-day, the antiquary fancies that he hears his voice as he enters the Rue du Puits-qui-parle--the street of the \"Speaking Well.\"--*Paris*",
    "To confine ourselves to the cell in the Tour-Roland, we must say that it had never lacked recluses.--*Paris*",
    "After the death of Madame Roland, it had stood vacant for a year or two, though rarely.--*Paris*",
    "Many women had come thither to mourn, until their death, for relatives, lovers, faults.--*Paris*",
    "Parisian malice, which thrusts its finger into everything, even into things which concern it the least, affirmed that it had beheld but few widows there.--*Paris*",
    "In accordance with the fashion of the epoch, a Latin inscription on the wall indicated to the learned passer-by the pious purpose of this cell.--*Paris*",
    "The custom was retained until the middle of the sixteenth century of explaining an edifice by a brief device inscribed above the door.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, one still reads in France, above the wicket of the prison in the seignorial mansion of Tourville, ~Sileto et spera~; in Ireland, beneath the armorial bearings which surmount the grand door to Fortescue Castle, ~Forte scutum, salus ducum~; in England, over the principal entrance to the hospitable mansion of the Earls Cowper: ~Tuum est~.--*Paris*",
    "At that time every edifice was a thought.--*Paris*",
    "As there was no door to the walled cell of the Tour-Roland, these two words had been carved in large Roman capitals over the window,----*Paris*",
    "TU, ORA.--*Paris*",
    "And this caused the people, whose good sense does not perceive so much refinement in things, and likes to translate _Ludovico Magno_ by \"Porte Saint-Denis,\" to give to this dark, gloomy, damp cavity, the name of \"The Rat-Hole.\"--*Paris*",
    "An explanation less sublime, perhaps, than the other; but, on the other hand, more picturesque.--*Paris*",
    "Book 6 Chapter 3 History Of A Leavened Cake Of Maize--*Paris*",
    "At the epoch of this history, the cell in the Tour-Roland was occupied.--*Paris*",
    "If the reader desires to know by whom, he has only to lend an ear to the conversation of three worthy gossips, who, at the moment when we have directed his attention to the Rat-Hole, were directing their steps towards the same spot, coming up along the water's edge from the Chatelet, towards the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "Two of these women were dressed like good ~bourgeoises~ of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "Their fine white ruffs; their petticoats of linsey- woolsey, striped red and blue; their white knitted stockings, with clocks embroidered in colors, well drawn upon their legs; the square-toed shoes of tawny leather with black soles, and, above all, their headgear, that sort of tinsel horn, loaded down with ribbons and laces, which the women of Champagne still wear, in company with the grenadiers of the imperial guard of Russia, announced that they belonged to that class wives which holds the middle ground between what the lackeys call a woman and what they term a lady.--*Paris*",
    "They wore neither rings nor gold crosses, and it was easy to see that, in their ease, this did not proceed from poverty, but simply from fear of being fined.--*Paris*",
    "Their companion was attired in very much the same manner; but there was that indescribable something about her dress and bearing which suggested the wife of a provincial notary.--*Paris*",
    "One could see, by the way in which her girdle rose above her hips, that she had not been long in Paris.--Add to this a plaited tucker, knots of ribbon on her shoes--and that the stripes of her petticoat ran horizontally instead of vertically, and a thousand other enormities which shocked good taste.--*Paris*",
    "The two first walked with that step peculiar to Parisian ladies, showing Paris to women from the country.--*Paris*",
    "The provincial held by the hand a big boy, who held in his a large, flat cake.--*Paris*",
    "We regret to be obliged to add, that, owing to the rigor of the season, he was using his tongue as a handkerchief.--*Paris*",
    "The child was making them drag him along, ~non passibus Cequis~, as Virgil says, and stumbling at every moment, to the great indignation of his mother.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that he was looking at his cake more than at the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "Some serious motive, no doubt, prevented his biting it (the cake), for he contented himself with gazing tenderly at it.--*Paris*",
    "But the mother should have rather taken charge of the cake.--*Paris*",
    "It was cruel to make a Tantalus of the chubby-checked boy.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the three demoiselles (for the name of dames was then reserved for noble women) were all talking at once.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that the provincial was on the point of taking offence, for the honor of her pillory.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately, that discreet damoiselle, Oudarde Musnier, turned the conversation in time.--*Paris*",
    "Plump and worthy Oudarde was preparing to retort, and the quarrel might, perhaps, have proceeded to a pulling of caps, had not Mahiette suddenly exclaimed,--\"Look at those people assembled yonder at the end of the bridge!--*Paris*",
    "There is something in their midst that they are looking at!\"--*Paris*",
    "And she set out on a run along the quay towards the Gr\u00e8ve, until she had left the bridge far behind her.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, the child whom she was dragging after her fell upon his knees; she halted breathless.--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde and Gervaise rejoined her.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette shook her head with a pensive air.--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde nodded affirmatively.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette sighed, and wiped away a tear which trickled from her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette went on.--*Paris*",
    "She was very much frightened by the Egyptians, and wept.--*Paris*",
    "But her mother kissed her more warmly and went away enchanted with the good fortune which the soothsayers had foretold for her Agnes.--*Paris*",
    "She was to be a beauty, virtuous, a queen.--*Paris*",
    "So she returned to her attic in the Rue Folle-Peine, very proud of bearing with her a queen.--*Paris*",
    "The next day she took advantage of a moment when the child was asleep on her bed, (for they always slept together), gently left the door a little way open, and ran to tell a neighbor in the Rue de la S\u00e9chesserie, that the day would come when her daughter Agnes would be served at table by the King of England and the Archduke of Ethiopia, and a hundred other marvels.--*Paris*",
    "On her return, hearing no cries on the staircase, she said to herself: 'Good!--*Paris*",
    "the child is still asleep!'--*Paris*",
    "She found her door wider open than she had left it, but she entered, poor mother, and ran to the bed.---The child was no longer there, the place was empty.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing remained of the child, but one of her pretty little shoes.--*Paris*",
    "She flew out of the room, dashed down the stairs, and began to beat her head against the wall, crying: 'My child!--*Paris*",
    "who has my child?--*Paris*",
    "Who has taken my child?'--*Paris*",
    "The street was deserted, the house isolated; no one could tell her anything about it.--*Paris*",
    "She went about the town, searched all the streets, ran hither and thither the whole day long, wild, beside herself, terrible, snuffing at doors and windows like a wild beast which has lost its young.--*Paris*",
    "She was breathless, dishevelled, frightful to see, and there was a fire in her eyes which dried her tears.--*Paris*",
    "She stopped the passers-by and cried: 'My daughter!--*Paris*",
    "my daughter!--*Paris*",
    "my pretty little daughter!--*Paris*",
    "If any one will give me back my daughter, I will he his servant, the servant of his dog, and he shall eat my heart if he will.'--*Paris*",
    "She met M. le Cur\u00e9 of Saint- Remy, and said to him: 'Monsieur, I will till the earth with my finger-nails, but give me back my child!'--*Paris*",
    "It was heartrending, Oudarde; and IL saw a very hard man, Master Ponce Lacabre, the procurator, weep.--*Paris*",
    "Ah!--*Paris*",
    "poor mother!--*Paris*",
    "In the evening she returned home.--*Paris*",
    "During her absence, a neighbor had seen two gypsies ascend up to it with a bundle in their arms, then descend again, after closing the door.--*Paris*",
    "After their departure, something like the cries of a child were heard in Paquette's room.--*Paris*",
    "The mother, burst into shrieks of laughter, ascended the stairs as though on wings, and entered.--A frightful thing to tell, Oudarde!--*Paris*",
    "Instead of her pretty little Agnes, so rosy and so fresh, who was a gift of the good God, a sort of hideous little monster, lame, one-eyed, deformed, was crawling and squalling over the floor.--*Paris*",
    "She hid her eyes in horror.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette walked on in silence.--*Paris*",
    "She was absorbed in that revery which is, in some sort, the continuation of a mournful tale, and which ends only after having communicated the emotion, from vibration to vibration, even to the very last fibres of the heart.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, Gervaise addressed her, \"And did they ever learn what became of la Chantefleurie?\"--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette made no reply.--*Paris*",
    "Gervaise repeated her question, and shook her arm, calling her by name.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette appeared to awaken from her thoughts.--*Paris*",
    "She added, after a pause,----*Paris*",
    "Oudarde, a big and tender woman, would have been well pleased to sigh in company with Mahiette.--*Paris*",
    "But Gervaise, more curious, had not finished her questions.--*Paris*",
    "While chatting thus, the three worthy ~bourgeoises~ had arrived at the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "In their absorption, they had passed the public breviary of the Tour-Roland without stopping, and took their way mechanically towards the pillory around which the throng was growing more dense with every moment.--*Paris*",
    "It is probable that the spectacle which at that moment attracted all looks in that direction, would have made them forget completely the Rat-Hole, and the halt which they intended to make there, if big Eustache, six years of age, whom Mahiette was dragging along by the hand, had not abruptly recalled the object to them: \"Mother,\" said he, as though some instinct warned him that the Rat-Hole was behind him, \"can I eat the cake now?\"--*Paris*",
    "If Eustache had been more adroit, that is to say, less greedy, he would have continued to wait, and would only have hazarded that simple question, \"Mother, can I eat the cake, now?\"--*Paris*",
    "on their return to the University, to Master Andry Musnier's, Rue Madame la Valence, when he had the two arms of the Seine and the five bridges of the city between the Rat-Hole and the cake.--*Paris*",
    "This question, highly imprudent at the moment when Eustache put it, aroused Mahiette's attention.--*Paris*",
    "But this did not suit Eustache.--*Paris*",
    "The three women retraced their steps, and, on arriving in the vicinity of the Tour-Roland, Oudarde said to the other two,----*Paris*",
    "She proceeded alone to the window.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when she looked in, a profound pity was depicted on all her features, and her frank, gay visage altered its expression and color as abruptly as though it had passed from a ray of sunlight to a ray of moonlight; her eye became humid; her mouth contracted, like that of a person on the point of weeping.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, she laid her finger on her lips, and made a sign to Mahiette to draw near and look.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette, much touched, stepped up in silence, on tiptoe, as though approaching the bedside of a dying person.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, a melancholy spectacle which presented itself to the eyes of the two women, as they gazed through the grating of the Rat-Hole, neither stirring nor breathing.--*Paris*",
    "The cell was small, broader than it was long, with an arched ceiling, and viewed from within, it bore a considerable resemblance to the interior of a huge bishop's mitre.--*Paris*",
    "On the bare flagstones which formed the floor, in one corner, a woman was sitting, or rather, crouching.--*Paris*",
    "Her chin rested on her knees, which her crossed arms pressed forcibly to her breast.--*Paris*",
    "Thus doubled up, clad in a brown sack, which enveloped her entirely in large folds, her long, gray hair pulled over in front, falling over her face and along her legs nearly to her feet, she presented, at the first glance, only a strange form outlined against the dark background of the cell, a sort of dusky triangle, which the ray of daylight falling through the opening, cut roughly into two shades, the one sombre, the other illuminated.--*Paris*",
    "It was one of those spectres, half light, half shadow, such as one beholds in dreams and in the extraordinary work of Goya, pale, motionless, sinister, crouching over a tomb, or leaning against the grating of a prison cell.--*Paris*",
    "It was neither a woman, nor a man, nor a living being, nor a definite form; it was a figure, a sort of vision, in which the real and the fantastic intersected each other, like darkness and day.--*Paris*",
    "It was with difficulty that one distinguished, beneath her hair which spread to the ground, a gaunt and severe profile; her dress barely allowed the extremity of a bare foot to escape, which contracted on the hard, cold pavement.--*Paris*",
    "The little of human form of which one caught a sight beneath this envelope of mourning, caused a shudder.--*Paris*",
    "That figure, which one might have supposed to be riveted to the flagstones, appeared to possess neither movement, nor thought, nor breath.--*Paris*",
    "Lying, in January, in that thin, linen sack, lying on a granite floor, without fire, in the gloom of a cell whose oblique air-hole allowed only the cold breeze, but never the sun, to enter from without, she did not appear to suffer or even to think.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she had turned to stone with the cell, ice with the season.--*Paris*",
    "Her hands were clasped, her eyes fixed.--*Paris*",
    "At first sight one took her for a spectre; at the second, for a statue.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, at intervals, her blue lips half opened to admit a breath, and trembled, but as dead and as mechanical as the leaves which the wind sweeps aside.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, from her dull eyes there escaped a look, an ineffable look, a profound, lugubrious, imperturbable look, incessantly fixed upon a corner of the cell which could not be seen from without; a gaze which seemed to fix all the sombre thoughts of that soul in distress upon some mysterious object.--*Paris*",
    "Such was the creature who had received, from her habitation, the name of the \"recluse\"; and, from her garment, the name of \"the sacked nun.\"--*Paris*",
    "The three women, for Gervaise had rejoined Mahiette and Oudarde, gazed through the window.--*Paris*",
    "Their heads intercepted the feeble light in the cell, without the wretched being whom they thus deprived of it seeming to pay any attention to them.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Mahiette was gazing with ever-increasing anxiety at that wan, withered, dishevelled head, and her eyes filled with tears.--*Paris*",
    "She thrust her head through the bars, and succeeded in casting a glance at the corner where the gaze of the unhappy woman was immovably riveted.--*Paris*",
    "When she withdrew her head from the window, her countenance was inundated with tears.--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde replied,----*Paris*",
    "Then, laying her finger on her lips, she motioned to the astounded Oudarde to thrust her head through the window and look.--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde looked and beheld, in the corner where the eyes of the recluse were fixed in that sombre ecstasy, a tiny shoe of pink satin, embroidered with a thousand fanciful designs in gold and silver.--*Paris*",
    "Gervaise looked after Oudarde, and then the three women, gazing upon the unhappy mother, began to weep.--*Paris*",
    "But neither their looks nor their tears disturbed the recluse.--*Paris*",
    "Her hands remained clasped; her lips mute; her eyes fixed; and that little shoe, thus gazed at, broke the heart of any one who knew her history.--*Paris*",
    "The three women had not yet uttered a single word; they dared not speak, even in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "This deep silence, this deep grief, this profound oblivion in which everything had disappeared except one thing, produced upon them the effect of the grand altar at Christmas or Easter.--*Paris*",
    "They remained silent, they meditated, they were ready to kneel.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to them that they were ready to enter a church on the day of Tenebrae.--*Paris*",
    "At length Gervaise, the most curious of the three, and consequently the least sensitive, tried to make the recluse speak:--*Paris*",
    "She repeated this call three times, raising her voice each time.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse did not move; not a word, not a glance, not a sigh, not a sign of life.--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde, in her turn, in a sweeter, more caressing voice,--\"Sister!\"--*Paris*",
    "said she, \"Sister Sainte-Gudule!\"--*Paris*",
    "The same silence; the same immobility.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that if the soul had not already quitted this inert, sluggish, lethargic body, it had at least retreated and concealed itself in depths whither the perceptions of the exterior organs no longer penetrated.--*Paris*",
    "Eustache, who, up to that moment had been diverted by a little carriage drawn by a large dog, which had just passed, suddenly perceived that his three conductresses were gazing at something through the window, and, curiosity taking possession of him in his turn, he climbed upon a stone post, elevated himself on tiptoe, and applied his fat, red face to the opening, shouting, \"Mother, let me see too!\"--*Paris*",
    "At the sound of this clear, fresh, ringing child's voice, the recluse trembled; she turned her head with the sharp, abrupt movement of a steel spring, her long, fleshless hands cast aside the hair from her brow, and she fixed upon the child, bitter, astonished, desperate eyes.--*Paris*",
    "This glance was but a lightning flash.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, this shock had, so to speak, awakened the recluse.--*Paris*",
    "A long shiver traversed her frame from head to foot; her teeth chattered; she half raised her head and said, pressing her elbows against her hips, and clasping her feet in her hands as though to warm them,----*Paris*",
    "She shook her head in token of refusal.--*Paris*",
    "Again she shook her head, looked at Oudarde fixedly and replied, \"Water.\"--*Paris*",
    "Oudarde persisted,--\"No, sister, that is no beverage for January.--*Paris*",
    "You must drink a little hippocras and eat this leavened cake of maize, which we have baked for you.\"--*Paris*",
    "She refused the cake which Mahiette offered to her, and said, \"Black bread.\"--*Paris*",
    "She refused the cloak as she had refused the flagon and the cake, and replied, \"A sack.\"--*Paris*",
    "She added, after a silence, \"'Tis a festival, I am forgotten.--*Paris*",
    "People do well.--*Paris*",
    "Why should the world think of me, when I do not think of it?--*Paris*",
    "Cold charcoal makes cold ashes.\"--*Paris*",
    "And as though fatigued with having said so much, she dropped her head on her knees again.--*Paris*",
    "The simple and charitable Oudarde, who fancied that she understood from her last words that she was complaining of the cold, replied innocently, \"Then you would like a little fire?\"--*Paris*",
    "Every limb was trembling, her voice quivered, her eyes flashed, she had raised herself upon her knees; suddenly she extended her thin, white hand towards the child, who was regarding her with a look of astonishment.--*Paris*",
    "Then she fell face downward on the earth, and her forehead struck the stone, with the sound of one stone against another stone.--*Paris*",
    "The three women thought her dead.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, however, she moved, and they beheld her drag herself, on her knees and elbows, to the corner where the little shoe was.--*Paris*",
    "Then they dared not look; they no longer saw her; but they heard a thousand kisses and a thousand sighs, mingled with heartrending cries, and dull blows like those of a head in contact with a wall.--*Paris*",
    "Then, after one of these blows, so violent that all three of them staggered, they heard no more.--*Paris*",
    "Mahiette, choked to such a point that she could not speak, made an effort.--*Paris*",
    "A child who innocently blows upon the badly ignited fuse of a bomb, and makes it explode in his face, is no more terrified than was Mahiette at the effect of that name, abruptly launched into the cell of Sister Gudule.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse trembled all over, rose erect on her bare feet, and leaped at the window with eyes so glaring that Mahiette and Oudarde, and the other woman and the child recoiled even to the parapet of the quay.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the sinister face of the recluse appeared pressed to the grating of the air-hole.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, a scene which was passing at the pillory caught her wild eye.--*Paris*",
    "Her brow contracted with horror, she stretched her two skeleton arms from her cell, and shrieked in a voice which resembled a death-rattle, \"So 'tis thou once more, daughter of Egypt!--*Paris*",
    "Book 6 Chapter 4 A Tear For A Drop Of Water--*Paris*",
    "These words were, so to speak, the point of union of two scenes, which had, up to that time, been developed in parallel lines at the same moment, each on its particular theatre; one, that which the reader has just perused, in the Rat-Hole; the other, which he is about to read, on the ladder of the pillory.--*Paris*",
    "The first had for witnesses only the three women with whom the reader has just made acquaintance; the second had for spectators all the public which we have seen above, collecting on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, around the pillory and the gibbet.--*Paris*",
    "That crowd which the four sergeants posted at nine o'clock in the morning at the four corners of the pillory had inspired with the hope of some sort of an execution, no doubt, not a hanging, but a whipping, a cropping of ears, something, in short,--that crowd had increased so rapidly that the four policemen, too closely besieged, had had occasion to \"press\" it, as the expression then ran, more than once, by sound blows of their whips, and the haunches of their horses.--*Paris*",
    "This populace, disciplined to waiting for public executions, did not manifest very much impatience.--*Paris*",
    "It amused itself with watching the pillory, a very simple sort of monument, composed of a cube of masonry about six feet high and hollow in the interior.--*Paris*",
    "A very steep staircase, of unhewn stone, which was called by distinction \"the ladder,\" led to the upper platform, upon which was visible a horizontal wheel of solid oak.--*Paris*",
    "The victim was bound upon this wheel, on his knees, with his hands behind his back.--*Paris*",
    "A wooden shaft, which set in motion a capstan concealed in the interior of the little edifice, imparted a rotatory motion to the wheel, which always maintained its horizontal position, and in this manner presented the face of the condemned man to all quarters of the square in succession.--*Paris*",
    "This was what was called \"turning\" a criminal.--*Paris*",
    "As the reader perceives, the pillory of the Gr\u00e8ve was far from presenting all the recreations of the pillory of the Halles.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing architectural, nothing monumental.--*Paris*",
    "No roof to the iron cross, no octagonal lantern, no frail, slender columns spreading out on the edge of the roof into capitals of acanthus leaves and flowers, no waterspouts of chimeras and monsters, on carved woodwork, no fine sculpture, deeply sunk in the stone.--*Paris*",
    "They were forced to content themselves with those four stretches of rubble work, backed with sandstone, and a wretched stone gibbet, meagre and bare, on one side.--*Paris*",
    "The entertainment would have been but a poor one for lovers of Gothic architecture.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that nothing was ever less curious on the score of architecture than the worthy gapers of the Middle Ages, and that they cared very little for the beauty of a pillory.--*Paris*",
    "The victim finally arrived, bound to the tail of a cart, and when he had been hoisted upon the platform, where he could be seen from all points of the Place, bound with cords and straps upon the wheel of the pillory, a prodigious hoot, mingled with laughter and acclamations, burst forth upon the Place.--*Paris*",
    "They had recognized Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "It was he, in fact.--*Paris*",
    "The change was singular.--*Paris*",
    "Pilloried on the very place where, on the day before, he had been saluted, acclaimed, and proclaimed Pope and Prince of Fools, in the cortege of the Duke of Egypt, the King of Thunes, and the Emperor of Galilee!--*Paris*",
    "One thing is certain, and that is, that there was not a soul in the crowd, not even himself, though in turn triumphant and the sufferer, who set forth this combination clearly in his thought.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire and his philosophy were missing at this spectacle.--*Paris*",
    "Soon Michel Noiret, sworn trumpeter to the king, our lord, imposed silence on the louts, and proclaimed the sentence, in accordance with the order and command of monsieur the provost.--*Paris*",
    "Then he withdrew behind the cart, with his men in livery surcoats.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, impassible, did not wince.--*Paris*",
    "All resistance had been rendered impossible to him by what was then called, in the style of the criminal chancellery, \"the vehemence and firmness of the bonds\" which means that the thongs and chains probably cut into his flesh; moreover, it is a tradition of jail and wardens, which has not been lost, and which the handcuffs still preciously preserve among us, a civilized, gentle, humane people (the galleys and the guillotine in parentheses).--*Paris*",
    "He had allowed himself to be led, pushed, carried, lifted, bound, and bound again.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing was to be seen upon his countenance but the astonishment of a savage or an idiot.--*Paris*",
    "He was known to be deaf; one might have pronounced him to be blind.--*Paris*",
    "They placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no resistance.--*Paris*",
    "They removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he allowed them to have their way.--*Paris*",
    "They entangled him under a fresh system of thongs and buckles; he allowed them to bind and buckle him.--*Paris*",
    "Only from time to time he snorted noisily, like a calf whose head is hanging and bumping over the edge of a butcher's cart.--*Paris*",
    "There was wild laughter among the crowd when they beheld Quasimodo's hump, his camel's breast, his callous and hairy shoulders laid bare.--*Paris*",
    "During this gayety, a man in the livery of the city, short of stature and robust of mien, mounted the platform and placed himself near the victim.--*Paris*",
    "His name speedily circulated among the spectators.--*Paris*",
    "It was Master Pierrat Torterue, official torturer to the Chatelet.--*Paris*",
    "He began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour-glass, the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed to glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti-colored surtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a thin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs, armed with metal nails.--*Paris*",
    "With his left hand, he negligently folded back his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, Jehan Frollo, elevating his curly blonde head above the crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of Robin Poussepain for the purpose), shouted: \"Come and look, gentle ladies and men!--*Paris*",
    "they are going to peremptorily flagellate Master Quasimodo, the bellringer of my brother, monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, a knave of oriental architecture, who has a back like a dome, and legs like twisted columns!\"--*Paris*",
    "And the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.--*Paris*",
    "At length the torturer stamped his foot.--*Paris*",
    "The wheel began to turn.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo wavered beneath his bonds.--*Paris*",
    "The amazement which was suddenly depicted upon his deformed face caused the bursts of laughter to redouble around him.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, at the moment when the wheel in its revolution presented to Master Pierrat, the humped back of Quasimodo, Master Pierrat raised his arm; the fine thongs whistled sharply through the air, like a handful of adders, and fell with fury upon the wretch's shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo leaped as though awakened with a start.--*Paris*",
    "He began to understand.--*Paris*",
    "He writhed in his bonds; a violent contraction of surprise and pain distorted the muscles of his face, but he uttered not a single sigh.--*Paris*",
    "He merely turned his head backward, to the right, then to the left, balancing it as a bull does who has been stung in the flanks by a gadfly.--*Paris*",
    "A second blow followed the first, then a third, and another and another, and still others.--*Paris*",
    "The wheel did not cease to turn, nor the blows to rain down.--*Paris*",
    "Soon the blood burst forth, and could be seen trickling in a thousand threads down the hunchback's black shoulders; and the slender thongs, in their rotatory motion which rent the air, sprinkled drops of it upon the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had resumed, to all appearance, his first imperturbability.--*Paris*",
    "He had at first tried, in a quiet way and without much outward movement, to break his bonds.--*Paris*",
    "His eye had been seen to light up, his muscles to stiffen, his members to concentrate their force, and the straps to stretch.--*Paris*",
    "The effort was powerful, prodigious, desperate; but the provost's seasoned bonds resisted.--*Paris*",
    "They cracked, and that was all.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo fell back exhausted.--*Paris*",
    "Amazement gave way, on his features, to a sentiment of profound and bitter discouragement.--*Paris*",
    "He closed his single eye, allowed his head to droop upon his breast, and feigned death.--*Paris*",
    "From that moment forth, he stirred no more.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing could force a movement from him.--*Paris*",
    "Neither his blood, which did not cease to flow, nor the blows which redoubled in fury, nor the wrath of the torturer, who grew excited himself and intoxicated with the execution, nor the sound of the horrible thongs, more sharp and whistling than the claws of scorpions.--*Paris*",
    "At length a bailiff from the Chatelet clad in black, mounted on a black horse, who had been stationed beside the ladder since the beginning of the execution, extended his ebony wand towards the hour-glass.--*Paris*",
    "The torturer stopped.--*Paris*",
    "The wheel stopped.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo's eye opened slowly.--*Paris*",
    "The scourging was finished.--*Paris*",
    "Two lackeys of the official torturer bathed the bleeding shoulders of the patient, anointed them with some unguent which immediately closed all the wounds, and threw upon his back a sort of yellow vestment, in cut like a chasuble.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, Pierrat Torterue allowed the thongs, red and gorged with blood, to drip upon the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "All was not over for Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He had still to undergo that hour of pillory which Master Florian Barbedienne had so judiciously added to the sentence of Messire Robert d'Estouteville; all to the greater glory of the old physiological and psychological play upon words of Jean de Cum\u00e8ne, ~Surdus absurdus~: a deaf man is absurd.--*Paris*",
    "So the hour-glass was turned over once more, and they left the hunchback fastened to the plank, in order that justice might be accomplished to the very end.--*Paris*",
    "The populace, especially in the Middle Ages, is in society what the child is in the family.--*Paris*",
    "As long as it remains in its state of primitive ignorance, of moral and intellectual minority, it can be said of it as of the child,----*Paris*",
    "We have already shown that Quasimodo was generally hated, for more than one good reason, it is true.--*Paris*",
    "There was hardly a spectator in that crowd who had not or who did not believe that he had reason to complain of the malevolent hunchback of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "The joy at seeing him appear thus in the pillory had been universal; and the harsh punishment which he had just suffered, and the pitiful condition in which it had left him, far from softening the populace had rendered its hatred more malicious by arming it with a touch of mirth.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, the \"public prosecution\" satisfied, as the bigwigs of the law still express it in their jargon, the turn came of a thousand private vengeances.--*Paris*",
    "Here, as in the Grand Hall, the women rendered themselves particularly prominent.--*Paris*",
    "All cherished some rancor against him, some for his malice, others for his ugliness.--*Paris*",
    "The latter were the most furious.--*Paris*",
    "And the two scholars, Jehan du Moulin, and Robin Poussepain, sang at the top of their lungs, the ancient refrain,----*Paris*",
    "A thousand other insults rained down upon him, and hoots and imprecations, and laughter, and now and then, stones.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was deaf but his sight was clear, and the public fury was no less energetically depicted on their visages than in their words.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, the blows from the stones explained the bursts of laughter.--*Paris*",
    "At first he held his ground.--*Paris*",
    "But little by little that patience which had borne up under the lash of the torturer, yielded and gave way before all these stings of insects.--*Paris*",
    "The bull of the Asturias who has been but little moved by the attacks of the picador grows irritated with the dogs and banderilleras.--*Paris*",
    "He first cast around a slow glance of hatred upon the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "But bound as he was, his glance was powerless to drive away those flies which were stinging his wound.--*Paris*",
    "Then he moved in his bonds, and his furious exertions made the ancient wheel of the pillory shriek on its axle.--*Paris*",
    "All this only increased the derision and hooting.--*Paris*",
    "Then the wretched man, unable to break his collar, like that of a chained wild beast, became tranquil once more; only at intervals a sigh of rage heaved the hollows of his chest.--*Paris*",
    "There was neither shame nor redness on his face.--*Paris*",
    "He was too far from the state of society, and too near the state of nature to know what shame was.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, with such a degree of deformity, is infamy a thing that can be felt?--*Paris*",
    "But wrath, hatred, despair, slowly lowered over that hideous visage a cloud which grew ever more and more sombre, ever more and more charged with electricity, which burst forth in a thousand lightning flashes from the eye of the cyclops.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, that cloud cleared away for a moment, at the passage of a mule which traversed the crowd, bearing a priest.--*Paris*",
    "As far away as he could see that mule and that priest, the poor victim's visage grew gentler.--*Paris*",
    "The fury which had contracted it was followed by a strange smile full of ineffable sweetness, gentleness, and tenderness.--*Paris*",
    "In proportion as the priest approached, that smile became more clear, more distinct, more radiant.--*Paris*",
    "It was like the arrival of a Saviour, which the unhappy man was greeting.--*Paris*",
    "But as soon as the mule was near enough to the pillory to allow of its rider recognizing the victim, the priest dropped his eyes, beat a hasty retreat, spurred on rigorously, as though in haste to rid himself of humiliating appeals, and not at all desirous of being saluted and recognized by a poor fellow in such a predicament.--*Paris*",
    "This priest was Archdeacon Dom Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "The cloud descended more blackly than ever upon Quasimodo's brow.--*Paris*",
    "The smile was still mingled with it for a time, but was bitter, discouraged, profoundly sad.--*Paris*",
    "Time passed on.--*Paris*",
    "He had been there at least an hour and a half, lacerated, maltreated, mocked incessantly, and almost stoned.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he moved again in his chains with redoubled despair, which made the whole framework that bore him tremble, and, breaking the silence which he had obstinately preserved hitherto, he cried in a hoarse and furious voice, which resembled a bark rather than a human cry, and which was drowned in the noise of the hoots--\"Drink!\"--*Paris*",
    "This exclamation of distress, far from exciting compassion, only added amusement to the good Parisian populace who surrounded the ladder, and who, it must be confessed, taken in the mass and as a multitude, was then no less cruel and brutal than that horrible tribe of robbers among whom we have already conducted the reader, and which was simply the lower stratum of the populace.--*Paris*",
    "Not a voice was raised around the unhappy victim, except to jeer at his thirst.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that at that moment he was more grotesque and repulsive than pitiable, with his face purple and dripping, his eye wild, his mouth foaming with rage and pain, and his tongue lolling half out.--*Paris*",
    "It must also be stated that if a charitable soul of a bourgeois or ~bourgeoise~, in the rabble, had attempted to carry a glass of water to that wretched creature in torment, there reigned around the infamous steps of the pillory such a prejudice of shame and ignominy, that it would have sufficed to repulse the good Samaritan.--*Paris*",
    "At the expiration of a few moments, Quasimodo cast a desperate glance upon the crowd, and repeated in a voice still more heartrending: \"Drink!\"--*Paris*",
    "And all began to laugh.--*Paris*",
    "A woman hurled a stone at his head,----*Paris*",
    "At that moment he beheld the crowd give way.--*Paris*",
    "A young girl, fantastically dressed, emerged from the throng.--*Paris*",
    "She was accompanied by a little white goat with gilded horns, and carried a tambourine in her hand.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo's eyes sparkled.--*Paris*",
    "It was the gypsy whom he had attempted to carry off on the preceding night, a misdeed for which he was dimly conscious that he was being punished at that very moment; which was not in the least the case, since he was being chastised only for the misfortune of being deaf, and of having been judged by a deaf man.--*Paris*",
    "He doubted not that she had come to wreak her vengeance also, and to deal her blow like the rest.--*Paris*",
    "He beheld her, in fact, mount the ladder rapidly.--*Paris*",
    "Wrath and spite suffocate him.--*Paris*",
    "He would have liked to make the pillory crumble into ruins, and if the lightning of his eye could have dealt death, the gypsy would have been reduced to powder before she reached the platform.--*Paris*",
    "She approached, without uttering a syllable, the victim who writhed in a vain effort to escape her, and detaching a gourd from her girdle, she raised it gently to the parched lips of the miserable man.--*Paris*",
    "Then, from that eye which had been, up to that moment, so dry and burning, a big tear was seen to fall, and roll slowly down that deformed visage so long contracted with despair.--*Paris*",
    "It was the first, in all probability, that the unfortunate man had ever shed.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, be had forgotten to drink.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy made her little pout, from impatience, and pressed the spout to the tusked month of Quasimodo, with a smile.--*Paris*",
    "He drank with deep draughts.--*Paris*",
    "His thirst was burning.--*Paris*",
    "When he had finished, the wretch protruded his black lips, no doubt, with the object of kissing the beautiful hand which had just succoured him.--*Paris*",
    "But the young girl, who was, perhaps, somewhat distrustful, and who remembered the violent attempt of the night, withdrew her hand with the frightened gesture of a child who is afraid of being bitten by a beast.--*Paris*",
    "Then the poor deaf man fixed on her a look full of reproach and inexpressible sadness.--*Paris*",
    "It would have been a touching spectacle anywhere,--this beautiful, fresh, pure, and charming girl, who was at the same time so weak, thus hastening to the relief of so much misery, deformity, and malevolence.--*Paris*",
    "On the pillory, the spectacle was sublime.--*Paris*",
    "The very populace were captivated by it, and began to clap their hands, crying,----*Paris*",
    "It was at that moment that the recluse caught sight, from the window of her bole, of the gypsy on the pillory, and hurled at her her sinister imprecation,----*Paris*",
    "Book 6 Chapter 5 End Of The Story Of The Cake--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda turned pale and descended from the pillory, staggering as she went.--*Paris*",
    "The voice of the recluse still pursued her,----*Paris*",
    "The hour had arrived for removing Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He was unbound, the crowd dispersed.--*Paris*",

    "Book 7 Chapter 1 The Danger Of Confiding One's Secret To A Go--*Paris*",
    "Many weeks had elapsed.--*Paris*",
    "The first of March had arrived.--*Paris*",
    "The sun, which Dubartas, that classic ancestor of periphrase, had not yet dubbed the \"Grand-duke of Candles,\" was none the less radiant and joyous on that account.--*Paris*",
    "It was one of those spring days which possesses so much sweetness and beauty, that all Paris turns out into the squares and promenades and celebrates them as though they were Sundays.--*Paris*",
    "In those days of brilliancy, warmth, and serenity, there is a certain hour above all others, when the fa?ade of Notre-Dame should be admired.--*Paris*",
    "It is the moment when the sun, already declining towards the west, looks the cathedral almost full in the face.--*Paris*",
    "Its rays, growing more and more horizontal, withdraw slowly from the pavement of the square, and mount up the perpendicular fa?ade, whose thousand bosses in high relief they cause to start out from the shadows, while the great central rose window flames like the eye of a cyclops, inflamed with the reflections of the forge.--*Paris*",
    "This was the hour.--*Paris*",
    "Opposite the lofty cathedral, reddened by the setting sun, on the stone balcony built above the porch of a rich Gothic house, which formed the angle of the square and the Rue du Parvis, several young girls were laughing and chatting with every sort of grace and mirth.--*Paris*",
    "From the length of the veil which fell from their pointed coif, twined with pearls, to their heels, from the fineness of the embroidered chemisette which covered their shoulders and allowed a glimpse, according to the pleasing custom of the time, of the swell of their fair virgin bosoms, from the opulence of their under-petticoats still more precious than their overdress (marvellous refinement), from the gauze, the silk, the velvet, with which all this was composed, and, above all, from the whiteness of their hands, which certified to their leisure and idleness, it was easy to divine they were noble and wealthy heiresses.--*Paris*",
    "They were, in fact, Damoiselle Fleur-de-Lys de Gondelaurier and her companions, Diane de Christeuil, Amelotte de Montmichel, Colombe de Gaillefontaine, and the little de Champchevrier maiden; all damsels of good birth, assembled at that moment at the house of the dame widow de Gondelaurier, on account of Monseigneur de Beaujeu and Madame his wife, who were to come to Paris in the month of April, there to choose maids of honor for the Dauphiness Marguerite, who was to be received in Picardy from the hands of the Flemings.--*Paris*",
    "Now, all the squires for twenty leagues around were intriguing for this favor for their daughters, and a goodly number of the latter had been already brought or sent to Paris.--*Paris*",
    "These four maidens had been confided to the discreet and venerable charge of Madame Aloise de Gondelaurier, widow of a former commander of the king's cross-bowmen, who had retired with her only daughter to her house in the Place du Parvis, Notre- Dame, in Paris.--*Paris*",
    "The balcony on which these young girls stood opened from a chamber richly tapestried in fawn-colored Flanders leather, stamped with golden foliage.--*Paris*",
    "The beams, which cut the ceiling in parallel lines, diverted the eye with a thousand eccentric painted and gilded carvings.--*Paris*",
    "Splendid enamels gleamed here and there on carved chests; a boar's head in faience crowned a magnificent dresser, whose two shelves announced that the mistress of the house was the wife or widow of a knight banneret.--*Paris*",
    "At the end of the room, by the side of a lofty chimney blazoned with arms from top to bottom, in a rich red velvet arm-chair, sat Dame de Gondelaurier, whose five and fifty years were written upon her garments no less distinctly than upon her face.--*Paris*",
    "Beside her stood a young man of imposing mien, although partaking somewhat of vanity and bravado--one of those handsome fellows whom all women agree to admire, although grave men learned in physiognomy shrug their shoulders at them.--*Paris*",
    "This young man wore the garb of a captain of the king's unattached archers, which bears far too much resemblance to the costume of Jupiter, which the reader has already been enabled to admire in the first book of this history, for us to inflict upon him a second description.--*Paris*",
    "The damoiselles were seated, a part in the chamber, a part in the balcony, some on square cushions of Utrecht velvet with golden corners, others on stools of oak carved in flowers and figures.--*Paris*",
    "Each of them held on her knee a section of a great needlework tapestry, on which they were working in company, while one end of it lay upon the rush mat which covered the floor.--*Paris*",
    "They were chatting together in that whispering tone and with the half-stifled laughs peculiar to an assembly of young girls in whose midst there is a young man.--*Paris*",
    "The young man whose presence served to set in play all these feminine self- conceits, appeared to pay very little heed to the matter, and, while these pretty damsels were vying with one another to attract his attention, he seemed to be chiefly absorbed in polishing the buckle of his sword belt with his doeskin glove.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time, the old lady addressed him in a very low tone, and he replied as well as he was able, with a sort of awkward and constrained politeness.--*Paris*",
    "From the smiles and significant gestures of Dame Aloise, from the glances which she threw towards her daughter, Fleur-de-Lys, as she spoke low to the captain, it was easy to see that there was here a question of some betrothal concluded, some marriage near at hand no doubt, between the young man and Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "From the embarrassed coldness of the officer, it was easy to see that on his side, at least, love had no longer any part in the matter.--*Paris*",
    "His whole air was expressive of constraint and weariness, which our lieutenants of the garrison would to-day translate admirably as, \"What a beastly bore!\"--*Paris*",
    "The poor dame, very much infatuated with her daughter, like any other silly mother, did not perceive the officer's lack of enthusiasm, and strove in low tones to call his attention to the infinite grace with which Fleur-de-Lys used her needle or wound her skein.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, he was obliged to bend down again, and Dame Aloise said to him,----*Paris*",
    "We can assure our readers that timidity was neither the captain's virtue nor his defect.--*Paris*",
    "But he made an effort to do what was demanded of him.--*Paris*",
    "It was evident that Fleur-de-Lys saw much more clearly than her mother through the captain's cold and absent-minded manner.--*Paris*",
    "He felt the necessity of making some conversation.--*Paris*",
    "The captain took up a corner of the tapestry.--*Paris*",
    "There was a rather pettish intonation in Fleur-de-Lys's-- laconic words.--*Paris*",
    "The young man understood that it was indispensable that he should whisper something in her ear, a commonplace, a gallant compliment, no matter what.--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly he bent down, but he could find nothing in his imagination more tender and personal than this,----*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys raised her beautiful eyes, full of reproach, \"Is that all of which you can assure me?\"--*Paris*",
    "she said, in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, Dame Aloise, delighted to see them thus bending towards each other and whispering, said as she toyed with the clasps of her prayer-book,----*Paris*",
    "The captain, more and more embarrassed, fell back upon the subject of the tapestry,--\"'Tis, in sooth, a charming work!\"--*Paris*",
    "he exclaimed.--*Paris*",
    "Whereupon Colombe de Gaillefontaine, another beautiful blonde, with a white skin, dressed to the neck in blue damask, ventured a timid remark which she addressed to Fleur-de-Lys, in the hope that the handsome captain would reply to it, \"My dear Gondelaurier, have you seen the tapestries of the H?tel de la Roche-Guyon?\"--*Paris*",
    "Madame de Gondelaurier continued, \"Fine tapestries, in truth.--*Paris*",
    "A work so esteemed that it passes as unrivalled.\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment B\u00e9rang\u00e8re de Champchevrier, a slender little maid of seven years, who was peering into the square through the trefoils of the balcony, exclaimed, \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "look, fair Godmother Fleur-de-Lys, at that pretty dancer who is dancing on the pavement and playing the tambourine in the midst of the loutish bourgeois!\"--*Paris*",
    "The sonorous vibration of a tambourine was, in fact, audible.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, all this was mingled in him, with great pretentions to elegance, toilet, and a fine appearance.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader reconcile these things as best he can.--*Paris*",
    "I am simply the historian.--*Paris*",
    "He had remained, therefore, for several minutes, leaning in silence against the carved jamb of the chimney, and thinking or not thinking, when Fleur-de-Lys suddenly turned and addressed him.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the poor young girl was pouting against the dictates of her heart.--*Paris*",
    "A secret desire for reconciliation was apparent in this gentle invitation which she gave him to approach her, and in the care which she took to call him by name.--*Paris*",
    "Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers (for it is he whom the reader has had before his eyes since the beginning of this chapter) slowly approached the balcony.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus looked, and said,----*Paris*",
    "Without moving from her arm-chair, Dame Aloise interposed, \"Is she not one of those gypsy girls who arrived last year by the Gibard gate?\"--*Paris*",
    "Mademoiselle de Gondelaurier knew how her mother's antiquated mode of speech shocked the captain.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, he began to sneer, and muttered between his teeth: \"Porte Gibard!--*Paris*",
    "Porte Gibard!--*Paris*",
    "All the young girls raised their eyes.--*Paris*",
    "A man was, in truth, leaning on the balustrade which surmounted the northern tower, looking on the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "He was a priest.--*Paris*",
    "His costume could be plainly discerned, and his face resting on both his hands.--*Paris*",
    "But he stirred no more than if he had been a statue.--*Paris*",
    "His eyes, intently fixed, gazed into the Place.--*Paris*",
    "It was something like the immobility of a bird of prey, who has just discovered a nest of sparrows, and is gazing at it.--*Paris*",
    "The dancer was not beating her tambourine at the moment.--*Paris*",
    "She turned her head towards the point whence this call proceeded, her brilliant eyes rested on Phoebus, and she stopped short.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl looked at him again, then she blushed as though a flame had mounted into her cheeks, and, taking her tambourine under her arm, she made her way through the astonished spectators towards the door of the house where Phoebus was calling her, with slow, tottering steps, and with the troubled look of a bird which is yielding to the fascination of a serpent.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, the tapestry porti\u00e8re was raised, and the gypsy appeared on the threshold of the chamber, blushing, confused, breathless, her large eyes drooping, and not daring to advance another step.--*Paris*",
    "B\u00e9rang\u00e8re clapped her hands.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the dancer remained motionless upon the threshold.--*Paris*",
    "Her appearance had produced a singular effect upon these young girls.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that a vague and indistinct desire to please the handsome officer animated them all, that his splendid uniform was the target of all their coquetries, and that from the moment he presented himself, there existed among them a secret, suppressed rivalry, which they hardly acknowledged even to themselves, but which broke forth, none the less, every instant, in their gestures and remarks.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, as they were all very nearly equal in beauty, they contended with equal arms, and each could hope for the victory.--The arrival of the gypsy suddenly destroyed this equilibrium.--*Paris*",
    "Her beauty was so rare, that, at the moment when she appeared at the entrance of the apartment, it seemed as though she diffused a sort of light which was peculiar to herself.--*Paris*",
    "In that narrow chamber, surrounded by that sombre frame of hangings and woodwork, she was incomparably more beautiful and more radiant than on the public square.--*Paris*",
    "She was like a torch which has suddenly been brought from broad daylight into the dark.--*Paris*",
    "The noble damsels were dazzled by her in spite of themselves.--*Paris*",
    "Each one felt herself, in some sort, wounded in her beauty.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, their battle front (may we be allowed the expression,) was immediately altered, although they exchanged not a single word.--*Paris*",
    "But they understood each other perfectly.--*Paris*",
    "Women's instincts comprehend and respond to each other more quickly than the intelligences of men.--*Paris*",
    "An enemy had just arrived; all felt it--all rallied together.--*Paris*",
    "One drop of wine is sufficient to tinge a glass of water red; to diffuse a certain degree of ill temper throughout a whole assembly of pretty women, the arrival of a prettier woman suffices, especially when there is but one man present.--*Paris*",
    "Hence the welcome accorded to the gypsy was marvellously glacial.--*Paris*",
    "They surveyed her from head to foot, then exchanged glances, and all was said; they understood each other.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the young girl was waiting to be spoken to, in such emotion that she dared not raise her eyelids.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was the first to break the silence.--*Paris*",
    "This remark, which a more delicate admirer would have uttered in a lower tone, at least was not of a nature to dissipate the feminine jealousies which were on the alert before the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys replied to the captain with a bland affectation of disdain;--\"Not bad.\"--*Paris*",
    "The others whispered.--*Paris*",
    "At length, Madame Aloise, who was not the less jealous because she was so for her daughter, addressed the dancer,--\"Approach, little one.\"--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy advanced towards the noble dame.--*Paris*",
    "She interrupted him, with a smile and a look full of infinite sweetness,----*Paris*",
    "There was in the intonation of that \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "no,\" uttered after that \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "yes,\" an ineffable something which wounded Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "The captain burst out laughing.--*Paris*",
    "He stopped short.--*Paris*",
    "This remark was a flash of light to the others.--*Paris*",
    "Not being able to impugn her beauty, they attacked her costume.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in truth, a spectacle worthy of a more intelligent spectator than Phoebus, to see how these beautiful maidens, with their envenomed and angry tongues, wound, serpent-like, and glided and writhed around the street dancer.--*Paris*",
    "They were cruel and graceful; they searched and rummaged maliciously in her poor and silly toilet of spangles and tinsel.--*Paris*",
    "There was no end to their laughter, irony, and humiliation.--*Paris*",
    "Sarcasms rained down upon the gypsy, and haughty condescension and malevolent looks.--*Paris*",
    "One would have thought they were young Roman dames thrusting golden pins into the breast of a beautiful slave.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced them elegant grayhounds, circling, with inflated nostrils, round a poor woodland fawn, whom the glance of their master forbade them to devour.--*Paris*",
    "After all, what was a miserable dancer on the public squares in the presence of these high-born maidens?--*Paris*",
    "They seemed to take no heed of her presence, and talked of her aloud, to her face, as of something unclean, abject, and yet, at the same time, passably pretty.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy was not insensible to these pin-pricks.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time a flush of shame, a flash of anger inflamed her eyes or her cheeks; with disdain she made that little grimace with which the reader is already familiar, but she remained motionless; she fixed on Phoebus a sad, sweet, resigned look.--*Paris*",
    "There was also happiness and tenderness in that gaze.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she endured for fear of being expelled.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus laughed, and took the gypsy's part with a mixture of impertinence and pity.--*Paris*",
    "At this reply uttered carelessly by the captain, like a stray stone, whose fall one does not even watch, Colombe began to laugh, as well as Diane, Amelotte, and Fleur-de-Lys, into whose eyes at the same time a tear started.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy, who had dropped her eyes on the floor at the words of Colombe de Gaillefontaine, raised them beaming with joy and pride and fixed them once more on Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "She was very beautiful at that moment.--*Paris*",
    "The old dame, who was watching this scene, felt offended, without understanding why.--*Paris*",
    "It was the goat, who had just arrived, in search of his mistress, and who, in dashing towards the latter, had begun by entangling his horns in the pile of stuffs which the noble dame's garments heaped up on her feet when she was seated.--*Paris*",
    "This created a diversion.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy disentangled his horns without uttering a word.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy crouched down on her knees and leaned her cheek against the fondling head of the goat.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she was asking pardon for having quitted it thus.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Diane had bent down to Colombe's ear.--*Paris*",
    "Diane and Colombe eagerly addressed the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment Fleur-de-Lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather suspended from the neck of the goat,-- \"What is that?\"--*Paris*",
    "she asked of the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,-- \"That is my secret.\"--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,--\" Come now, gypsy, if neither you nor your goat can dance for us, what are you doing here?\"--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy walked slowly towards the door, without making any reply.--*Paris*",
    "But the nearer she approached it, the more her pace slackened.--*Paris*",
    "An irresistible magnet seemed to hold her.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly she turned her eyes, wet with tears, towards Phoebus, and halted.--*Paris*",
    "At this strange name, a burst of wild laughter broke from the young girls.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, several minutes previously, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re had coaxed the goat into a corner of the room with a marchpane cake, without any one having noticed her.--*Paris*",
    "In an instant they had become good friends.--*Paris*",
    "The curious child had detached the bag from the goat's neck, had opened it, and had emptied out its contents on the rush matting; it was an alphabet, each letter of which was separately inscribed on a tiny block of boxwood.--*Paris*",
    "Hardly had these playthings been spread out on the matting, when the child, with surprise, beheld the goat (one of whose \"miracles\" this was no doubt), draw out certain letters with its golden hoof, and arrange them, with gentle pushes, in a certain order.--*Paris*",
    "In a moment they constituted a word, which the goat seemed to have been trained to write, so little hesitation did it show in forming it, and B\u00e9rang\u00e8re suddenly exclaimed, clasping her hands in admiration,----*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys ran up and trembled.--*Paris*",
    "The letters arranged upon the floor formed this word,----*Paris*",
    "PHOEBUS.--*Paris*",
    "It was impossible to doubt it; the child did not know how to write.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, at the child's exclamation, all had hastened up, the mother, the young girls, the gypsy, and the officer.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy beheld the piece of folly which the goat had committed.--*Paris*",
    "She turned red, then pale, and began to tremble like a culprit before the captain, who gazed at her with a smile of satisfaction and amazement.--*Paris*",
    "She fell fainting.--*Paris*",
    "In a twinkling, La Esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters, made a sign to Djali, and went out through one door, while Fleur-de-Lys was being carried out through the other.--*Paris*",
    "Captain Phoebus, on being left alone, hesitated for a moment between the two doors, then he followed the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 2 A Priest And A Philosopher Are Two Different--*Paris*",
    "The priest whom the young girls had observed at the top of the North tower, leaning over the Place and so attentive to the dance of the gypsy, was, in fact, Archdeacon Claude Frollo.--*Paris*",
    "Our readers have not forgotten the mysterious cell which the archdeacon had reserved for himself in that tower.--*Paris*",
    "Every day, an hour before sunset, the archdeacon ascended the staircase to the tower, and shut himself up in this cell, where he sometimes passed whole nights.--*Paris*",
    "That day, at the moment when, standing before the low door of his retreat, he was fitting into the lock the complicated little key which he always carried about him in the purse suspended to his side, a sound of tambourine and castanets had reached his ear.--*Paris*",
    "These sounds came from the Place du Parvis.--*Paris*",
    "The cell, as we have already said, had only one window opening upon the rear of the church.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo had hastily withdrawn the key, and an instant later, he was on the top of the tower, in the gloomy and pensive attitude in which the maidens had seen him.--*Paris*",
    "There he stood, grave, motionless, absorbed in one look and one thought.--*Paris*",
    "All Paris lay at his feet, with the thousand spires of its edifices and its circular horizon of gentle hills--with its river winding under its bridges, and its people moving to and fro through its streets,--with the clouds of its smoke,--with the mountainous chain of its roofs which presses Notre-Dame in its doubled folds; but out .of all the city, the archdeacon gazed at one corner only of the pavement, the Place du Parvis; in all that throng at but one figure,--the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "It would have been difficult to say what was the nature of this look, and whence proceeded the flame that flashed from it.--*Paris*",
    "It was a fixed gaze, which was, nevertheless, full of trouble and tumult.--*Paris*",
    "And, from the profound immobility of his whole body, barely agitated at intervals by an involuntary shiver, as a tree is moved by the wind; from the stiffness of his elbows, more marble than the balustrade on which they leaned; or the sight of the petrified smile which contracted his face,-- one would have said that nothing living was left about Claude Frollo except his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy was dancing; she was twirling her tambourine on the tip of her finger, and tossing it into the air as she danced Proven?al sarabands; agile, light, joyous, and unconscious of the formidable gaze which descended perpendicularly upon her head.--*Paris*",
    "The crowd was swarming around her; from time to time, a man accoutred in red and yellow made them form into a circle, and then returned, seated himself on a chair a few paces from the dancer, and took the goat's head on his knees.--*Paris*",
    "This man seemed to be the gypsy's companion.--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo could not distinguish his features from his elevated post.--*Paris*",
    "From the moment when the archdeacon caught sight of this stranger, his attention seemed divided between him and the dancer, and his face became more and more gloomy.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he rose upright, and a quiver ran through his whole body: \"Who is that man?\"--*Paris*",
    "he muttered between his teeth: \"I have always seen her alone before!\"--*Paris*",
    "Then he plunged down beneath the tortuous vault of the spiral staircase, and once more descended.--*Paris*",
    "As he passed the door of the bell chamber, which was ajar, be saw something which struck him; he beheld Quasimodo, who, leaning through an opening of one of those slate penthouses which resemble enormous blinds, appeared also to be gazing at the Place.--*Paris*",
    "He was engaged in so profound a contemplation, that he did not notice the passage of his adopted father.--*Paris*",
    "His savage eye had a singular expression; it was a charmed, tender look.--*Paris*",
    "In the place of the gypsy, on the carpet, whose arabesques had seemed to vanish but a moment previously by the capricious figures of her dance, the archdeacon no longer beheld any one but the red and yellow man, who, in order to earn a few testers in his turn, was walking round the circle, with his elbows on his hips, his head thrown back, his face red, his neck outstretched, with a chair between his teeth.--*Paris*",
    "To the chair he had fastened a cat, which a neighbor had lent, and which was spitting in great affright.--*Paris*",
    "The harsh voice of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such a commotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice, and the chair and the cat tumbled pell-mell upon the heads of the spectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings.--*Paris*",
    "It is probable that Master Pierre Gringoire (for it was indeed he) would have had a sorry account to settle with the neighbor who owned the cat, and all the bruised and scratched faces which surrounded him, if he had not hastened to profit by the tumult to take refuge in the church, whither Claude Frollo had made him a sign to follow him.--*Paris*",
    "The cathedral was already dark and deserted; the side-aisles were full of shadows, and the lamps of the chapels began to shine out like stars, so black had the vaulted ceiling become.--*Paris*",
    "Only the great rose window of the fa?ade, whose thousand colors were steeped in a ray of horizontal sunlight, glittered in the gloom like a mass of diamonds, and threw its dazzling reflection to the other end of the nave.--*Paris*",
    "When they had advanced a few paces, Dom Claude placed his back against a pillar, and gazed intently at Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "The gaze was not the one which Gringoire feared, ashamed as he was of having been caught by a grave and learned person in the costume of a buffoon.--*Paris*",
    "There was nothing mocking or ironical in the priest's glance, it was serious, tranquil, piercing.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon was the first to break the silence.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude listened in silence.--*Paris*",
    "All at once his deep-set eye assumed so sagacious and penetrating an expression, that Gringoire felt himself, so to speak, searched to the bottom of the soul by that glance.--*Paris*",
    "The priest's gloomy eyes flashed into flame.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon pressed Gringoire with questions.--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda, in the judgment of Gringoire, was an inoffensive and charming creature, pretty, with the exception of a pout which was peculiar to her; a na?ve and passionate damsel, ignorant of everything and enthusiastic about everything; not yet aware of the difference between a man and a woman, even in her dreams; made like that; wild especially over dancing, noise, the open air; a sort of woman bee, with invisible wings on her feet, and living in a whirlwind.--*Paris*",
    "She owed this nature to the wandering life which she had always led.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire had succeeded in learning that, while a mere child, she had traversed Spain and Catalonia, even to Sicily; he believed that she had even been taken by the caravan of Zingari, of which she formed a part, to the kingdom of Algiers, a country situated in Achaia, which country adjoins, on one side Albania and Greece; on the other, the Sicilian Sea, which is the road to Constantinople.--*Paris*",
    "The Bohemians, said Gringoire, were vassals of the King of Algiers, in his quality of chief of the White Moors.--*Paris*",
    "One thing is certain, that la Esmeralda had come to France while still very young, by way of Hungary.--*Paris*",
    "From all these countries the young girl had brought back fragments of queer jargons, songs, and strange ideas, which made her language as motley as her costume, half Parisian, half African.--*Paris*",
    "However, the people of the quarters which she frequented loved her for her gayety, her daintiness, her lively manners, her dances, and her songs.--*Paris*",
    "She believed herself to be hated, in all the city, by but two persons, of whom she often spoke in terror: the sacked nun of the Tour-Roland, a villanous recluse who cherished some secret grudge against these gypsies, and who cursed the poor dancer every time that the latter passed before her window; and a priest, who never met her without casting at her looks and words which frightened her.--*Paris*",
    "The mention of this last circumstance disturbed the archdeacon greatly, though Gringoire paid no attention to his perturbation; to such an extent had two months sufficed to cause the heedless poet to forget the singular details of the evening on which he had met the gypsy, and the presence of the archdeacon in it all.--*Paris*",
    "Otherwise, the little dancer feared nothing; she did not tell fortunes, which protected her against those trials for magic which were so frequently instituted against gypsy women.--*Paris*",
    "And then, Gringoire held the position of her brother, if not of her husband.--*Paris*",
    "After all, the philosopher endured this sort of platonic marriage very patiently.--*Paris*",
    "It meant a shelter and bread at least.--*Paris*",
    "Every morning, he set out from the lair of the thieves, generally with the gypsy; he helped her make her collections of targes* and little blanks** in the squares; each evening he returned to the same roof with her, allowed her to bolt herself into her little chamber, and slept the sleep of the just.--*Paris*",
    "A very sweet existence, taking it all in all, he said, and well adapted to revery.--*Paris*",
    "And then, on his soul and conscience, the philosopher was not very sure that he was madly in love with the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "He loved her goat almost as dearly.--*Paris*",
    "It was a charming animal, gentle, intelligent, clever; a learned goat.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing was more common in the Middle Ages than these learned animals, which amazed people greatly, and often led their instructors to the stake.--*Paris*",
    "But the witchcraft of the goat with the golden hoofs was a very innocent species of magic.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire explained them to the archdeacon, whom these details seemed to interest deeply.--*Paris*",
    "In the majority of cases, it was sufficient to present the tambourine to the goat in such or such a manner, in order to obtain from him the trick desired.--*Paris*",
    "He had been trained to this by the gypsy, who possessed, in these delicate arts, so rare a talent that two months had sufficed to teach the goat to write, with movable letters, the word \"Phoebus.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect for a moment.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he turned abruptly to Gringoire once more.--*Paris*",
    "Porn Claude frowned.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon's pale face became as crimson as the cheek of a young girl.--*Paris*",
    "He remained for a moment without answering; then, with visible embarrassment,----*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 3 The Bells--*Paris*",
    "After the morning in the pillory, the neighbors of Notre- Dame thought they noticed that Quasimodo's ardor for ringing had grown cool.--*Paris*",
    "Formerly, there had been peals for every occasion, long morning serenades, which lasted from prime to compline; peals from the belfry for a high mass, rich scales drawn over the smaller bells for a wedding, for a christening, and mingling in the air like a rich embroidery of all sorts of charming sounds.--*Paris*",
    "The old church, all vibrating and sonorous, was in a perpetual joy of bells.--*Paris*",
    "One was constantly conscious of the presence of a spirit of noise and caprice, who sang through all those mouths of brass.--*Paris*",
    "Now that spirit seemed to have departed; the cathedral seemed gloomy, and gladly remained silent; festivals and funerals had the simple peal, dry and bare, demanded by the ritual, nothing more.--*Paris*",
    "Of the double noise which constitutes a church, the organ within, the bell without, the organ alone remained.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that there was no longer a musician in the belfry.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was always there, nevertheless; what, then, had happened to him?--*Paris*",
    "Was it that the shame and despair of the pillory still lingered in the bottom of his heart, that the lashes of his tormentor's whip reverberated unendingly in his soul, and that the sadness of such treatment had wholly extinguished in him even his passion for the bells?--*Paris*",
    "or was it that Marie had a rival in the heart of the bellringer of Notre-Dame, and that the great bell and her fourteen sisters were neglected for something more amiable and more beautiful?--*Paris*",
    "It chanced that, in the year of grace 1482, Annunciation Day fell on Tuesday, the twenty-fifth of March.--*Paris*",
    "That day the air was so pure and light that Quasimodo felt some returning affection for his bells.--*Paris*",
    "He therefore ascended the northern tower while the beadle below was opening wide the doors of the church, which were then enormous panels of stout wood, covered with leather, bordered with nails of gilded iron, and framed in carvings \"very artistically elaborated.\"--*Paris*",
    "On arriving in the lofty bell chamber, Quasimodo gazed for some time at the six bells and shook his head sadly, as though groaning over some foreign element which had interposed itself in his heart between them and him.--*Paris*",
    "But when he had set them to swinging, when he felt that cluster of bells moving under his hand, when he saw, for he did not hear it, the palpitating octave ascend and descend that sonorous scale, like a bird hopping from branch to branch; when the demon Music, that demon who shakes a sparkling bundle of strette, trills and arpeggios, had taken possession of the poor deaf man, he became happy once more, he forgot everything, and his heart expanding, made his face beam.--*Paris*",
    "He went and came, he beat his hands together, he ran from rope to rope, he animated the six singers with voice and gesture, like the leader of an orchestra who is urging on intelligent musicians.--*Paris*",
    "He was wholly absorbed in spurring on his bells, all six of which vied with each other in leaping and shaking their shining haunches, like a noisy team of Spanish mules, pricked on here and there by the apostrophes of the muleteer.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, on letting his glance fall between the large slate scales which cover the perpendicular wall of the bell tower at a certain height, he beheld on the square a young girl, fantastically dressed, stop, spread out on the ground a carpet, on which a small goat took up its post, and a group of spectators collect around her.--*Paris*",
    "This sight suddenly changed the course of his ideas, and congealed his enthusiasm as a breath of air congeals melted rosin.--*Paris*",
    "He halted, turned his back to the bells, and crouched down behind the projecting roof of slate, fixing upon the dancer that dreamy, sweet, and tender look which had already astonished the archdeacon on one occasion.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the forgotten bells died away abruptly and all together, to the great disappointment of the lovers of bell ringing, who were listening in good faith to the peal from above the Pont du Change, and who went away dumbfounded, like a dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone.--*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 4 Anarkh--*Paris*",
    "It chanced that upon a fine morning in this same month of March, I think it was on Saturday the 29th, Saint Eustache's day, our young friend the student, Jehan Frollo du Moulin, perceived, as he was dressing himself, that his breeches, which contained his purse, gave out no metallic ring.--*Paris*",
    "He dressed himself sadly.--*Paris*",
    "An idea had occurred to him as he laced his boots, but he rejected it at first; nevertheless, it returned, and he put on his waistcoat wrong side out, an evident sign of violent internal combat.--*Paris*",
    "At last he dashed his cap roughly on the floor, and exclaimed: \"So much the worse!--*Paris*",
    "Let come of it what may.--*Paris*",
    "I am going to my brother!--*Paris*",
    "I shall catch a sermon, but I shall catch a crown.\"--*Paris*",
    "Then be hastily donned his long jacket with furred half- sleeves, picked up his cap, and went out like a man driven to desperation.--*Paris*",
    "He descended the Rue de la Harpe toward the City.--*Paris*",
    "As he passed the Rue de la Huchette, the odor of those admirable spits, which were incessantly turning, tickled his olfactory apparatus, and he bestowed a loving glance toward the Cyclopean roast, which one day drew from the Franciscan friar, Calatagirone, this pathetic exclamation: ~Veramente, queste rotisserie sono cosa stupenda~!--*Paris*",
    "He did not even take the trouble to cast a stone in passing, as was the usage, at the miserable statue of that P\u00e9rinet Leclerc who had delivered up the Paris of Charles VI.--*Paris*",
    "to the English, a crime which his effigy, its face battered with stones and soiled with mud, expiated for three centuries at the corner of the Rue de la Harpe and the Rue de Buci, as in an eternal pillory.--*Paris*",
    "The Petit-Pont traversed, the Rue Neuve-Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve crossed, Jehan de Molendino found himself in front of Notre- Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Then indecision seized upon him once more, and he paced for several minutes round the statue of M. Legris, repeating to himself with anguish: \"The sermon is sure, the crown is doubtful.\"--*Paris*",
    "He stopped a beadle who emerged from the cloister,--\"Where is monsieur the archdeacon of Josas?\"--*Paris*",
    "Jehan clapped his hands.--*Paris*",
    "This reflection having brought him to a decision, he plunged resolutely into the small black doorway, and began the ascent of the spiral of Saint-Gilles, which leads to the upper stories of the tower.--*Paris*",
    "On arriving at the gallery of slender columns, he took breath for a moment, and swore against the interminable staircase by I know not how many million cartloads of devils; then he resumed his ascent through the narrow door of the north tower, now closed to the public.--*Paris*",
    "Several moments after passing the bell chamber, he came upon a little landing-place, built in a lateral niche, and under the vault of a low, pointed door, whose enormous lock and strong iron bars he was enabled to see through a loophole pierced in the opposite circular wall of the staircase.--*Paris*",
    "Persons desirous of visiting this door at the present day will recognize it by this inscription engraved in white letters on the black wall: \"J'ADORE CORALIE, 1823.--*Paris*",
    "SIGNE UGENE.\"--*Paris*",
    "The key was in the lock, the door was very close to him; he gave it a gentle push and thrust his head through the opening.--*Paris*",
    "The reader cannot have failed to turn over the admirable works of Rembrandt, that Shakespeare of painting.--*Paris*",
    "Amid so many marvellous engravings, there is one etching in particular, which is supposed to represent Doctor Faust, and which it is impossible to contemplate without being dazzled.--*Paris*",
    "It represents a gloomy cell; in the centre is a table loaded with hideous objects; skulls, spheres, alembics, compasses, hieroglyphic parchments.--*Paris*",
    "The doctor is before this table clad in his large coat and covered to the very eyebrows with his furred cap.--*Paris*",
    "He is visible only to his waist.--*Paris*",
    "He has half risen from his immense arm-chair, his clenched fists rest on the table, and he is gazing with curiosity and terror at a large luminous circle, formed of magic letters, which gleams from the wall beyond, like the solar spectrum in a dark chamber.--*Paris*",
    "This cabalistic sun seems to tremble before the eye, and fills the wan cell with its mysterious radiance.--*Paris*",
    "It is horrible and it is beautiful.--*Paris*",
    "Something very similar to Faust's cell presented itself to Jehan's view, when he ventured his head through the half- open door.--*Paris*",
    "It also was a gloomy and sparsely lighted retreat.--*Paris*",
    "There also stood a large arm-chair and a large table, compasses, alembics, skeletons of animals suspended from the ceiling, a globe rolling on the floor, hippocephali mingled promiscuously with drinking cups, in which quivered leaves of gold, skulls placed upon vellum checkered with figures and characters, huge manuscripts piled up wide open, without mercy on the cracking corners of the parchment; in short, all the rubbish of science, and everywhere on this confusion dust and spiders' webs; but there was no circle of luminous letters, no doctor in an ecstasy contemplating the flaming vision, as the eagle gazes upon the sun.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, the cell was not deserted.--*Paris*",
    "A man was seated in the arm-chair, and bending over the table.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan, to whom his back was turned, could see only his shoulders and the back of his skull; but he had no difficulty in recognizing that bald head, which nature had provided with an eternal tonsure, as though desirous of marking, by this external symbol, the archdeacon's irresistible clerical vocation.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan accordingly recognized his brother; but the door had been opened so softly, that nothing warned Dom Claude of his presence.--*Paris*",
    "The inquisitive scholar took advantage of this circumstance to examine the cell for a few moments at his leisure.--*Paris*",
    "A large furnace, which he had not at first observed, stood to the left of the arm-chair, beneath the window.--*Paris*",
    "The ray of light which penetrated through this aperture made its way through a spider's circular web, which tastefully inscribed its delicate rose in the arch of the window, and in the centre of which the insect architect hung motionless, like the hub of this wheel of lace.--*Paris*",
    "Upon the furnace were accumulated in disorder, all sorts of vases, earthenware bottles, glass retorts, and mattresses of charcoal.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan observed, with a sigh, that there was no frying-pan.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, there was no fire in the furnace, and it seemed as though none had been lighted for a long time.--*Paris*",
    "A glass mask, which Jehan noticed among the utensils of alchemy, and which served no doubt, to protect the archdeacon's face when he was working over some substance to be dreaded, lay in one corner covered with dust and apparently forgotten.--*Paris*",
    "Beside it lay a pair of bellows no less dusty, the upper side of which bore this inscription incrusted in copper letters: SPIRA SPERA.--*Paris*",
    "Other inscriptions were written, in accordance with the fashion of the hermetics, in great numbers on the walls; some traced with ink, others engraved with a metal point.--*Paris*",
    "There were, moreover, Gothic letters, Hebrew letters, Greek letters, and Roman letters, pell-mell; the inscriptions overflowed at haphazard, on top of each other, the more recent effacing the more ancient, and all entangled with each other, like the branches in a thicket, like pikes in an affray.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, a strangely confused mingling of all human philosophies, all reveries, all human wisdom.--*Paris*",
    "Here and there one shone out from among the rest like a banner among lance heads.--*Paris*",
    "Generally, it was a brief Greek or Roman device, such as the Middle Ages knew so well how to formulate.--~Unde?--*Paris*",
    "Inde?--Homo homini monstrurn-Ast'ra, castra, nomen, numen.--Meya Bibklov, ueya xaxov.--Sapere aude.--*Paris*",
    "Fiat ubi vult~--etc.--*Paris*",
    "The whole chamber, moreover, presented a general aspect of abandonment and dilapidation; and the bad state of the utensils induced the supposition that their owner had long been distracted from his labors by other preoccupations.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, this master, bent over a vast manuscript, ornamented with fantastical illustrations, appeared to be tormented by an idea which incessantly mingled with his meditations.--*Paris*",
    "That at least was Jehan's idea, when he heard him exclaim, with the thoughtful breaks of a dreamer thinking aloud,----*Paris*",
    "And he closed the book violently.--*Paris*",
    "He passed his hand over his brow, as though to brush away the idea which assailed him; then he took from the table a nail and a small hammer, whose handle was curiously painted with cabalistic letters.--*Paris*",
    "And he flung away the hammer in a rage.--*Paris*",
    "Then he sank down so deeply on the arm-chair and the table, that Jehan lost him from view behind the great pile of manuscripts.--*Paris*",
    "For the space of several minutes, all that he saw was his fist convulsively clenched on a book.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly, Dom Claude sprang up, seized a compass and engraved in silence upon the wall in capital letters, this Greek word--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon returned and seated himself in his armchair, and placed his head on both his hands, as a sick man does, whose head is heavy and burning.--*Paris*",
    "The student watched his brother with surprise.--*Paris*",
    "He did not know, he who wore his heart on his sleeve, he who observed only the good old law of Nature in the world, he who allowed his passions to follow their inclinations, and in whom the lake of great emotions was always dry, so freely did he let it off each day by fresh drains,--he did not know with what fury the sea of human passions ferments and boils when all egress is denied to it, how it accumulates, how it swells, how it overflows, how it hollows out the heart; how it breaks in inward sobs, and dull convulsions, until it has rent its dikes and burst its bed.--*Paris*",
    "The austere and glacial envelope of Claude Frollo, that cold surface of steep and inaccessible virtue, had always deceived Jehan.--*Paris*",
    "The merry scholar had never dreamed that there was boiling lava, furious and profound, beneath the snowy brow of AEtna.--*Paris*",
    "We do not know whether he suddenly became conscious of these things; but, giddy as he was, he understood that he had seen what he ought not to have seen, that he had just surprised the soul of his elder brother in one of its most secret altitudes, and that Claude must not be allowed to know it.--*Paris*",
    "Seeing that the archdeacon had fallen back into his former immobility, he withdrew his head very softly, and made some noise with his feet outside the door, like a person who has just arrived and is giving warning of his approach.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar entered boldly.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon, who was very much embarrassed by such a visit in such a place, trembled in his arm-chair.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude's visage had resumed its severe expression.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude made his arm-chair describe a quarter circle, and gazed intently at Jehan.--*Paris*",
    "This was a formidable exordium.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan braced himself for a rough encounter.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan did not reply.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar raised his eyes boldly.--*Paris*",
    "A slight flush spread over the cheeks of the priest with their high bones, like the puff of smoke which announces on the outside the secret commotions of a volcano.--*Paris*",
    "The student hardly noticed it.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude turned pale again, and the scholar pursued carelessly.--*Paris*",
    "And the archdeacon remained silent.--*Paris*",
    "This Greek lesson had rendered him thoughtful.--*Paris*",
    "Master Jehan, who possessed all the artful ways of a spoiled child, judged that the moment was a favorable one in which to risk his request.--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly, he assumed an extremely soft tone and began,----*Paris*",
    "But all this caressing hypocrisy did not have its usual effect on the severe elder brother.--*Paris*",
    "Cerberus did not bite at the honey cake.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon's brow did not lose a single wrinkle.--*Paris*",
    "At this audacious declaration, the archdeacon's visage assumed a thoroughly pedagogical and paternal expression.--*Paris*",
    "This question caused a flash of hope to gleam before Jehan's eyes.--*Paris*",
    "He resumed his dainty, caressing air.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that Jehan had made a very bad choice of names for his two friends.--*Paris*",
    "He realized it too late.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan broke the ice once more.--*Paris*",
    "This quotation, which the scholar borrowed with malice, perchance, from the wall of the cell, produced a singular effect on the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "He bit his lips and his wrath was drowned in a crimson flush.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar made one more effort.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar remained silent for a moment, with his finger in his ear, his eyes on the ground, and a discomfited mien.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he turned round to Claude with the agile quickness of a wagtail.--*Paris*",
    "At this response of the inflexible archdeacon, Jehan hid his head in his hands, like a woman sobbing, and exclaimed with an expression of despair: \"~Orororororoi~.\"--*Paris*",
    "And here he burst into a laugh so droll and violent that it made the archdeacon smile.--*Paris*",
    "It was Claude's fault, in fact: why had he so spoiled that child?--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon promptly returned to his original severity.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude shook his wrinkled head: \"~Qui non laborat~--\"--*Paris*",
    "Jehan did not allow him to finish.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon surveyed him with a gloomy air.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the sound of a footstep was heard on the staircase.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar concealed himself; just then a happy idea occurred to him.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan darted under the furnace again, and the door opened.--*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 5 The Two Men Clothed In Black--*Paris*",
    "The personage who entered wore a black gown and a gloomy mien.--*Paris*",
    "The first point which struck the eye of our Jehan (who, as the reader will readily surmise, had ensconced himself in his nook in such a manner as to enable him to see and hear everything at his good pleasure) was the perfect sadness of the garments and the visage of this new-corner.--*Paris*",
    "There was, nevertheless, some sweetness diffused over that face, but it was the sweetness of a cat or a judge, an affected, treacherous sweetness.--*Paris*",
    "He was very gray and wrinkled, and not far from his sixtieth year, his eyes blinked, his eyebrows were white, his lip pendulous, and his hands large.--*Paris*",
    "When Jehan saw that it was only this, that is to say, no doubt a physician or a magistrate, and that this man had a nose very far from his mouth, a sign of stupidity, he nestled down in his hole, in despair at being obliged to pass an indefinite time in such an uncomfortable attitude, and in such bad company.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon, in the meantime, had not even risen to receive this personage.--*Paris*",
    "He had made the latter a sign to seat himself on a stool near the door, and, after several moments of a silence which appeared to be a continuation of a preceding meditation, he said to him in a rather patronizing way, \"Good day, Master Jacques.\"--*Paris*",
    "There was in the two ways in which \"Master Jacques\" was pronounced on the one hand, and the \"master\" by preeminence on the other, the difference between monseigneur and monsieur, between ~domine~ and ~domne~.--*Paris*",
    "It was evidently the meeting of a teacher and a disciple.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude made a gesture of impatience.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing answers; that man is terrible.--*Paris*",
    "I am at my wit's end over him.\"--*Paris*",
    "So saying, Master Jacques unrolled a parchment.--*Paris*",
    "It was a vessel belonging to the same family as those which covered Dom Claude's furnace.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon began an examination of the vessel.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon was excessively pale.--*Paris*",
    "The torture of the wheel and axle!--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude seemed absorbed in gloomy abstraction.--*Paris*",
    "He turned to Charmolue,----*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude, buried in his own thoughts, no longer listened to him.--*Paris*",
    "Charmolue, following the direction of his glance, perceived that it was fixed mechanically on the great spider's web which draped the window.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, a bewildered fly which was seeking the March sun, flung itself through the net and became entangled there.--*Paris*",
    "On the agitation of his web, the enormous spider made an abrupt move from his central cell, then with one bound, rushed upon the fly, which he folded together with his fore antennae, while his hideous proboscis dug into the victim's bead.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon did not hear him.--*Paris*",
    "He became silent.--*Paris*",
    "These last ideas, which had gradually led him back from himself to science, appeared to have calmed him.--*Paris*",
    "Jacques Charmolue recalled him wholly to a sense of reality by addressing to him this question: \"Come, now, master, when will you come to aid me in making gold?--*Paris*",
    "I am impatient to succeed.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon shook his head, with a bitter smile.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment the sound of jaws in the act of mastication, which proceeded from beneath the furnace, struck Charmolue's uneasy ear.--*Paris*",
    "It was the scholar, who, ill at ease, and greatly bored in his hiding-place, had succeeded in discovering there a stale crust and a triangle of mouldy cheese, and had set to devouring the whole without ceremony, by way of consolation and breakfast.--*Paris*",
    "As he was very hungry, he made a great deal of noise, and he accented each mouthful strongly, which startled and alarmed the procurator.--*Paris*",
    "This explanation satisfied Charmolue.--*Paris*",
    "But Dom Claude, who stood in terror of some new freak on the part of Jehan, reminded his worthy disciple that they had some figures on the fa?ade to study together, and the two quitted the cell, to the accompaniment of a great \"ouf!\"--*Paris*",
    "from the scholar, who began to seriously fear that his knee would acquire the imprint of his chin.--*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 6 The Effect Which Seven Oaths In The Open Air--*Paris*",
    "He cast a glance of tenderness and admiration into the interior of the precious pouch, readjusted his toilet, rubbed up his boots, dusted his poor half sleeves, all gray with ashes, whistled an air, indulged in a sportive pirouette, looked about to see whether there were not something more in the cell to take, gathered up here and there on the furnace some amulet in glass which might serve to bestow, in the guise of a trinket, on Isabeau la Thierrye, finally pushed open the door which his brother had left unfastened, as a last indulgence, and which he, in his turn, left open as a last piece of malice, and descended the circular staircase, skipping like a bird.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of the gloom of the spiral staircase, he elbowed something which drew aside with a growl; he took it for granted that it was Quasimodo, and it struck him as so droll that he descended the remainder of the staircase holding his sides with laughter.--*Paris*",
    "On emerging upon the Place, he laughed yet more heartily.--*Paris*",
    "He stamped his foot when he found himself on the ground once again.--*Paris*",
    "He advanced a few paces, and caught sight of the two screech owls, that is to say, Dom Claude and Master Jacques Charmolue, absorbed in contemplation before a carving on the fa?ade.--*Paris*",
    "He approached them on tiptoe, and heard the archdeacon say in a low tone to Charmolue: \"'Twas Guillaume de Paris who caused a Job to be carved upon this stone of the hue of lapis-lazuli, gilded on the edges.--*Paris*",
    "Job represents the philosopher's stone, which must also be tried and martyrized in order to become perfect, as saith Raymond Lulle: ~Sub conservatione formoe speciftoe salva anima~.\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment he heard a powerful and sonorous voice articulate behind him a formidable series of oaths.--*Paris*",
    "This name of Phoebus reached the ears of the archdeacon at the moment when he was explaining to the king's procurator the dragon which is hiding its tail in a bath, from which issue smoke and the head of a king.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude started, interrupted himself and, to the great amazement of Charmolue, turned round and beheld his brother Jehan accosting a tall officer at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, Captain Phoebus de Chateaupers.--*Paris*",
    "He was backed up against a corner of the house of his betrothed and swearing like a heathen.--*Paris*",
    "This proposition calmed the captain.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan spread out the purse before the captain's eyes, with dignity and simplicity.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the archdeacon, who had abandoned the dumbfounded Charmolue where he stood, had approached them and halted a few paces distant, watching them without their noticing him, so deeply were they absorbed in contemplation of the purse.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus exclaimed: \"A purse in your pocket, Jehan!--*Paris*",
    "Jehan replied coldly: \"Here are the pebbles wherewith I pave my fob!\"--*Paris*",
    "And without adding another word, he emptied the purse on a neighboring post, with the air of a Roman saving his country.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan remained dignified and immovable.--*Paris*",
    "Several liards had rolled into the mud; the captain in his enthusiasm stooped to pick them up.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan restrained him.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus counted the coins, and turning towards Jehan with solemnity, \"Do you know, Jehan, that there are three and twenty sous parisis!--*Paris*",
    "whom have you plundered to-night, in the Street Cut-Weazand?\"--*Paris*",
    "Jehan flung back his blonde and curly head, and said, half- closing his eyes disdainfully,----*Paris*",
    "The two friends set out towards \"Eve's Apple.\"--*Paris*",
    "It is unnecessary to mention that they had first gathered up the money, and that the archdeacon followed them.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon followed them, gloomy and haggard.--*Paris*",
    "Was this the Phoebus whose accursed name had been mingled with all his thoughts ever since his interview with Gringoire?--*Paris*",
    "He did not know it, but it was at least a Phoebus, and that magic name sufficed to make the archdeacon follow the two heedless comrades with the stealthy tread of a wolf, listening to their words and observing their slightest gestures with anxious attention.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, nothing was easier than to hear everything they said, as they talked loudly, not in the least concerned that the passers-by were taken into their confidence.--*Paris*",
    "They talked of duels, wenches, wine pots, and folly.--*Paris*",
    "At the turning of a street, the sound of a tambourine reached them from a neighboring square.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude heard the officer say to the scholar,----*Paris*",
    "Here the archdeacon saw Phoebus sneer, bend down to Jehan's ear, and say a few words to him in a low voice; then Phoebus burst into a laugh, and shook his head with a triumphant air.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon heard the whole of this conversation.--*Paris*",
    "His teeth chattered; a visible shiver ran through his whole body.--*Paris*",
    "He halted for a moment, leaned against a post like a drunken man, then followed the two merry knaves.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he overtook them once more, they had changed their conversation.--*Paris*",
    "He heard them singing at the top of their lungs the ancient refrain,----*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 7 The Mysterious Monk--*Paris*",
    "The illustrious wine shop of \"Eve's Apple\" was situated in the University, at the corner of the Rue de la Rondelle and the Rue de la Batonnier.--*Paris*",
    "It was a very spacious and very low hail on the ground floor, with a vaulted ceiling whose central spring rested upon a huge pillar of wood painted yellow; tables everywhere, shining pewter jugs hanging on the walls, always a large number of drinkers, a plenty of wenches, a window on the street, a vine at the door, and over the door a flaring piece of sheet-iron, painted with an apple and a woman, rusted by the rain and turning with the wind on an iron pin.--*Paris*",
    "This species of weather-vane which looked upon the pavement was the signboard.--*Paris*",
    "Night was falling; the square was dark; the wine-shop, full of candles, flamed afar like a forge in the gloom; the noise of glasses and feasting, of oaths and quarrels, which escaped through the broken panes, was audible.--*Paris*",
    "Through the mist which the warmth of the room spread over the window in front, a hundred confused figures could be seen swarming, and from time to time a burst of noisy laughter broke forth from it.--*Paris*",
    "The passers-by who were going about their business, slipped past this tumultuous window without glancing at it.--*Paris*",
    "Only at intervals did some little ragged boy raise himself on tiptoe as far as the ledge, and hurl into the drinking-shop, that ancient, jeering hoot, with which drunken men were then pursued: \"Aux Houls, saouls, saouls, saouls!\"--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, one man paced imperturbably back and forth in front of the tavern, gazing at it incessantly, and going no further from it than a pikernan from his sentry-box.--*Paris*",
    "He was enveloped in a mantle to his very nose.--*Paris*",
    "This mantle he had just purchased of the old-clothes man, in the vicinity of the \"Eve's Apple,\" no doubt to protect himself from the cold of the March evening, possibly also, to conceal his costume.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time he paused in front of the dim window with its leaden lattice, listened, looked, and stamped his foot.--*Paris*",
    "At length the door of the dram-shop opened.--*Paris*",
    "This was what he appeared to be waiting for.--*Paris*",
    "Two boon companions came forth.--*Paris*",
    "The ray of light which escaped from the door crimsoned for a moment their jovial faces.--*Paris*",
    "The man in the mantle went and stationed himself on the watch under a porch on the other side of the street.--*Paris*",
    "The other replied staggering, \"It pleases you to say so, Phoebus; but it hath been proved that Plato had the profile of a hound.\"--*Paris*",
    "The reader has, no doubt, already recognized our two brave friends, the captain and the scholar.--*Paris*",
    "It appears that the man who was lying in wait for them had also recognized them, for he slowly followed all the zigzags that the scholar caused the captain to make, who being a more hardened drinker had retained all his self-possession.--*Paris*",
    "By listening to them attentively, the man in the mantle could catch in its entirety the following interesting conversation,----*Paris*",
    "The man in the mantle, who had not ceased to follow him, halted for a moment before the prostrate scholar, as though agitated by indecision; then, uttering a profound sigh, he also strode off in pursuit of the captain.--*Paris*",
    "We, like them, will leave Jehan to slumber beneath the open sky, and will follow them also, if it pleases the reader.--*Paris*",
    "On emerging into the Rue Saint-Andr\u00e9-des-Arcs, Captain Phoebus perceived that some one was following him.--*Paris*",
    "On glancing sideways by chance, he perceived a sort of shadow crawling after him along the walls.--*Paris*",
    "He halted, it halted; he resumed his march, it resumed its march.--*Paris*",
    "This disturbed him not overmuch.--*Paris*",
    "He paused in front of the College d'Autun.--*Paris*",
    "It was at this college that he had sketched out what he called his studies, and, through a scholar's teasing habit which still lingered in him, he never passed the fa?ade without inflicting on the statue of Cardinal Pierre Bertrand, sculptured to the right of the portal, the affront of which Priapus complains so bitterly in the satire of Horace, ~Olim truncus eram ficulnus~.--*Paris*",
    "He had done this with so much unrelenting animosity that the inscription, ~Eduensis episcopus~, had become almost effaced.--*Paris*",
    "Therefore, he halted before the statue according to his wont.--*Paris*",
    "The street was utterly deserted.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he was coolly retying his shoulder knots, with his nose in the air, he saw the shadow approaching him with slow steps, so slow that he had ample time to observe that this shadow wore a cloak and a hat.--*Paris*",
    "On arriving near him, it halted and remained more motionless than the statue of Cardinal Bertrand.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, it riveted upon Phoebus two intent eyes, full of that vague light which issues in the night time from the pupils of a cat.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was brave, and would have cared very little for a highwayman, with a rapier in his hand.--*Paris*",
    "But this walking statue, this petrified man, froze his blood.--*Paris*",
    "There were then in circulation, strange stories of a surly monk, a nocturnal prowler about the streets of Paris, and they recurred confusedly to his memory.--*Paris*",
    "He remained for several minutes in stupefaction, and finally broke the silence with a forced laugh.--*Paris*",
    "The hand of the shadow emerged from beneath its mantle and descended upon the arm of Phoebus with the grip of an eagle's talon; at the same time the shadow spoke,----*Paris*",
    "What, the devil!\"--*Paris*",
    "said Phoebus, \"you know my name!\"--*Paris*",
    "At this name, the shadow's grasp shook the arm of Phoebus in a fury.--*Paris*",
    "Any one who could have beheld at that moment the captain's inflamed countenance, his leap backwards, so violent that he disengaged himself from the grip which held him, the proud air with which he clapped his hand on his swordhilt, and, in the presence of this wrath the gloomy immobility of the man in the cloak,--any one who could have beheld this would have been frightened.--*Paris*",
    "There was in it a touch of the combat of Don Juan and the statue.--*Paris*",
    "The captain gnashed his teeth.--*Paris*",
    "Surly monk, phantom, superstitions,--he had forgotten all at that moment.--*Paris*",
    "He no longer beheld anything but a man, and an insult.--*Paris*",
    "But the other never stirred.--*Paris*",
    "When he beheld his adversary on guard and ready to parry,----*Paris*",
    "The rages of men like Phoebus are milk-soups, whose ebullition is calmed by a drop of cold water.--*Paris*",
    "This simple remark caused the sword which glittered in the captain's hand to be lowered.--*Paris*",
    "He replaced his sword in its scabbard.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus felt the stranger's cold hand slip into his a large piece of money.--*Paris*",
    "He could not refrain from taking the money and pressing the hand.--*Paris*",
    "They set out again at a rapid pace.--*Paris*",
    "At the expiration of a few minutes, the sound of the river announced to them that they were on the Pont Saint-Michel, then loaded with houses.--*Paris*",
    "His companion made no reply; he had not uttered a word since they had been walking side by side.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus halted before a low door, and knocked roughly; a light made its appearance through the cracks of the door.--*Paris*",
    "The door opened instantly, and allowed the new-corners to see an old woman and an old lamp, both of which trembled.--*Paris*",
    "The old woman was bent double, clad in tatters, with a shaking head, pierced with two small eyes, and coiffed with a dish clout; wrinkled everywhere, on hands and face and neck; her lips retreated under her gums, and about her mouth she had tufts of white hairs which gave her the whiskered look of a cat.--*Paris*",
    "The interior of the den was no less dilapitated than she; there were chalk walls, blackened beams in the ceiling, a dismantled chimney-piece, spiders' webs in all the corners, in the middle a staggering herd of tables and lame stools, a dirty child among the ashes, and at the back a staircase, or rather, a wooden ladder, which ended in a trap door in the ceiling.--*Paris*",
    "On entering this lair, Phoebus's mysterious companion raised his mantle to his very eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the captain, swearing like a Saracen, hastened to \"make the sun shine in a crown\" as saith our admirable R\u00e9gnier.--*Paris*",
    "The old woman addressed him as monseigneur, and shut up the crown in a drawer.--*Paris*",
    "It was the coin which the man in the black mantle had given to Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "While her back was turned, the bushy-headed and ragged little boy who was playing in the ashes, adroitly approached the drawer, abstracted the crown, and put in its place a dry leaf which he had plucked from a fagot.--*Paris*",
    "The old crone made a sign to the two gentlemen, as she called them, to follow her, and mounted the ladder in advance of them.--*Paris*",
    "On arriving at the upper story, she set her lamp on a coffer, and, Phoebus, like a frequent visitor of the house, opened a door which opened on a dark hole.--*Paris*",
    "Book 7 Chapter 8 The Utility Of Windows Which Open On The Riv--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo (for we presume that the reader, more intelligent than Phoebus, has seen in this whole adventure no other surly monk than the archdeacon), Claude Frollo groped about for several moments in the dark lair into which the captain had bolted him.--*Paris*",
    "It was one of those nooks which architects sometimes reserve at the point of junction between the roof and the supporting wall.--*Paris*",
    "A vertical section of this kennel, as Phoebus had so justly styled it, would have made a triangle.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, there was neither window nor air-hole, and the slope of the roof prevented one from standing upright.--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly, Claude crouched down in the dust, and the plaster which cracked beneath him; his head was on fire; rummaging around him with his hands, be found on the floor a bit of broken glass, which he pressed to his brow, and whose cool- ness afforded him some relief.--*Paris*",
    "What was taking place at that moment in the gloomy soul of the archdeacon?--*Paris*",
    "God and himself could alone know.--*Paris*",
    "In what order was he arranging in his mind la Esmeralda, Phoebus, Jacques Charmolue, his young brother so beloved, yet abandoned by him in the mire, his archdeacon's cassock, his reputation perhaps dragged to la Falourdel's, all these adventures, all these images?--*Paris*",
    "I cannot say.--*Paris*",
    "But it is certain that these ideas formed in his mind a horrible group.--*Paris*",
    "He had been waiting a quarter of an hour; it seemed to him that he had grown a century older.--*Paris*",
    "All at once be heard the creaking of the boards of the stairway; some one was ascending.--*Paris*",
    "The trapdoor opened once more; a light reappeared.--*Paris*",
    "There was a tolerably large crack in the worm-eaten door of his den; he put his face to it.--*Paris*",
    "In this manner he could see all that went on in the adjoining room.--*Paris*",
    "The cat-faced old crone was the first to emerge from the trap-door, lamp in hand; then Phoebus, twirling his moustache, then a third person, that beautiful and graceful figure, la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "The priest beheld her rise from below like a dazzling apparition.--*Paris*",
    "Claude trembled, a cloud spread over his eyes, his pulses beat violently, everything rustled and whirled around him; he no longer saw nor heard anything.--*Paris*",
    "When he recovered himself, Phoebus and Esmeralda were alone seated on the wooden coffer beside the lamp which made these two youthful figures and a miserable pallet at the end of the attic stand out plainly before the archdeacon's eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Beside the pallet was a window, whose panes broken like a spider's web upon which rain has fallen, allowed a view, through its rent meshes, of a corner of the sky, and the moon lying far away on an eiderdown bed of soft clouds.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl was blushing, confused, palpitating.--*Paris*",
    "Her long, drooping lashes shaded her crimson cheeks.--*Paris*",
    "The officer, to whom she dared not lift her eyes, was radiant.--*Paris*",
    "Mechanically, and with a charmingly unconscious gesture, she traced with the tip of her finger incoherent lines on the bench, and watched her finger.--*Paris*",
    "Her foot was not visible.--*Paris*",
    "The little goat was nestling upon it.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was very gallantly clad; he had tufts of embroidery at his neck and wrists; a great elegance at that day.--*Paris*",
    "It was not without difficulty that Dom Claude managed to hear what they were saying, through the humming of the blood, which was boiling in his temples.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl looked at him in affright: \"Hate me!--*Paris*",
    "what have I done?\"--*Paris*",
    "So saying, she fixed upon the captain her great black eyes, moist with joy and tenderness.--*Paris*",
    "Such a perfume of chastity, such a charm of virtue surrounded the young girl, that Phoebus did not feel completely at his ease beside her.--*Paris*",
    "But this remark emboldened him: \"You love me!\"--*Paris*",
    "he said with rapture, and he threw his arm round the gypsy's waist.--*Paris*",
    "He had only been waiting for this opportunity.--*Paris*",
    "The priest saw it, and tested with the tip of his finger the point of a poniard which he wore concealed in his breast.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy looked at the hilt, the blade; examined the cipher on the guard with adorable curiosity, and kissed the sword, saying,----*Paris*",
    "You are the sword of a brave man.--*Paris*",
    "I love my captain.\"--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus again profited by the opportunity to impress upon her beautiful bent neck a kiss which made the young girl straighten herself up as scarlet as a poppy.--*Paris*",
    "The priest gnashed his teeth over it in the dark.--*Paris*",
    "The captain rose to please her, chiding her with a smile of satisfaction,----*Paris*",
    "Phoebus returned and seated himself beside her, but much closer than before.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy gave him several little taps with her pretty hand on his mouth, with a childish mirth and grace and gayety.--*Paris*",
    "The captain had repeated this phrase so many times, in many similar conjunctures, that he delivered it all in one breath, without committing a single mistake.--*Paris*",
    "At this passionate declaration, the gypsy raised to the dirty ceiling which served for the skies a glance full of angelic happiness.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus found \"the moment\" favorable for robbing her of another kiss, which went to torture the unhappy archdeacon in his nook.--*Paris*",
    "The jealous girl interrupted him: \"Who?\"--*Paris*",
    "For several moments the young girl, absorbed in her charming thoughts, was dreaming to the sound of his voice, without listening to the sense of his words.--*Paris*",
    "She became pensive and silent once more.--*Paris*",
    "The captain, emboldened by her gentleness, clasped her waist without resistance; then began softly to unlace the poor child's corsage, and disarranged her tucker to such an extent that the panting priest beheld the gypsy's beautiful shoulder emerge from the gauze, as round and brown as the moon rising through the mists of the horizon.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl allowed Phoebus to have his way.--*Paris*",
    "She did not appear to perceive it.--*Paris*",
    "The eye of the bold captain flashed.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly she turned towards him,----*Paris*",
    "The captain's face assumed an expression of mingled surprise and disdain, of carelessness and libertine passion.--*Paris*",
    "The Bohemian turned pale, and her head drooped sadly on her breast.--*Paris*",
    "While speaking thus in his softest voice, he approached extremely near the gypsy; his caressing hands resumed their place around her supple and delicate waist, his eye flashed more and more, and everything announced that Monsieur Phoebus was on the verge of one of those moments when Jupiter himself commits so many follies that Homer is obliged to summon a cloud to his rescue.--*Paris*",
    "But Dom Claude saw everything.--*Paris*",
    "The door was made of thoroughly rotten cask staves, which left large apertures for the passage of his hawklike gaze.--*Paris*",
    "This brown-skinned, broad- shouldered priest, hitherto condemned to the austere virginity of the cloister, was quivering and boiling in the presence of this night scene of love and voluptuousness.--*Paris*",
    "This young and beautiful girl given over in disarray to the ardent young man, made melted lead flow in his-veins; his eyes darted with sensual jealousy beneath all those loosened pins.--*Paris*",
    "Any one who could, at that moment, have seen the face of the unhappy man glued to the wormeaten bars, would have thought that he beheld the face of a tiger glaring from the depths of a cage at some jackal devouring a gazelle.--*Paris*",
    "His eye shone like a candle through the cracks of the door.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, Phoebus, with a rapid gesture, removed the gypsy's gorgerette.--*Paris*",
    "The poor child, who had remained pale and dreamy, awoke with a start; she recoiled hastily from the enterprising officer, and, casting a glance at her bare neck and shoulders, red, confused, mute with shame, she crossed her two beautiful arms on her breast to conceal it.--*Paris*",
    "Had it not been for the flame which burned in her cheeks, at the sight of her so silent and motionless, one would have.--*Paris*",
    "declared her a statue of Modesty.--*Paris*",
    "Her eyes were lowered.--*Paris*",
    "But the captain's gesture had revealed the mysterious amulet which she wore about her neck.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus retreated amid said in a cold tone,----*Paris*",
    "So saying, she threw her arms round the officer's neck; she looked up at him, supplicatingly, with a beautiful smile, and all in tears.--*Paris*",
    "Her delicate neck rubbed against his cloth doublet with its rough embroideries.--*Paris*",
    "She writhed on her knees, her beautiful body half naked.--*Paris*",
    "The intoxicated captain pressed his ardent lips to those lovely African shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl, her eyes bent on the ceiling, as she leaned backwards, quivered, all palpitating, beneath this kiss.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, above Phoebus's head she beheld another head; a green, livid, convulsed face, with the look of a lost soul; near this face was a hand grasping a poniard.--It was the face and hand of the priest; he had broken the door and he was there.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus could not see him.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl remained motionless, frozen with terror, dumb, beneath that terrible apparition, like a dove which should raise its head at the moment when the hawk is gazing into her nest with its round eyes.--*Paris*",
    "She could not even utter a cry.--*Paris*",
    "She saw the poniard descend upon Phoebus, and rise again, reeking.--*Paris*",
    "She fainted.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when her eyes closed, when all feeling vanished in her, she thought that she felt a touch of fire imprinted upon her lips, a kiss more burning than the red-hot iron of the executioner.--*Paris*",
    "When she recovered her senses, she was surrounded by soldiers of the watch they were carrying away the captain, bathed in his blood the priest had disappeared; the window at the back of the room which opened on the river was wide open; they picked up a cloak which they supposed to belong to the officer and she heard them saying around her,--*Paris*",
    "Book 8 Chapter 1 The Crown Changed Into A Dry Leaf--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire and the entire Court of Miracles were suffering mortal anxiety.--*Paris*",
    "For a whole month they had not known what had become of la Esmeralda, which greatly pained the Duke of Egypt and his friends the vagabonds, nor what had become of the goat, which redoubled Gringoire's grief.--*Paris*",
    "One evening the gypsy had disappeared, and since that time had given no signs of life.--*Paris*",
    "All search had proved fruitless.--*Paris*",
    "Some tormenting bootblacks had told Gringoire about meeting her that same evening near the Pont Saint-Michel, going off with an officer; but this husband, after the fashion of Bohemia, was an incredulous philosopher, and besides, he, better than any one else, knew to what a point his wife was virginal.--*Paris*",
    "He had been able to form a judgment as to the unconquerable modesty resulting from the combined virtues of the amulet and the gypsy, and he had mathematically calculated the resistance of that chastity to the second power.--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly, he was at ease on that score.--*Paris*",
    "Still he could not understand this disappearance.--*Paris*",
    "It was a profound sorrow.--*Paris*",
    "He would have grown thin over it, had that been possible.--*Paris*",
    "He had forgotten everything, even his literary tastes, even his great work, ~De figuris regularibus et irregularibus~, which it was his intention to have printed with the first money which he should procure (for he had raved over printing, ever since he had seen the \"Didascalon\" of Hugues de Saint Victor, printed with the celebrated characters of Vindelin de Spire).--*Paris*",
    "One day, as he was passing sadly before the criminal Tournelle, he perceived a considerable crowd at one of the gates of the Palais de Justice.--*Paris*",
    "He dared not tell the young man that he was acquainted with his brother the archdeacon, to whom he had not returned after the scene in the church; a negligence which embarrassed him.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar went his way, and Gringoire set out to follow the crowd which was mounting the staircase of the great chamber.--*Paris*",
    "In his opinion, there was nothing like the spectacle of a criminal process for dissipating melancholy, so exhilaratingly stupid are judges as a rule.--*Paris*",
    "The populace which he had joined walked and elbowed in silence.--*Paris*",
    "After a slow and tiresome march through a long, gloomy corridor, which wound through the court-house like the intestinal canal of the ancient edifice, he arrived near a low door, opening upon a hall which his lofty stature permitted him to survey with a glance over the waving heads of the rabble.--*Paris*",
    "The hall was vast and gloomy, which latter fact made it appear still more spacious.--*Paris*",
    "The day was declining; the long, pointed windows permitted only a pale ray of light to enter, which was extinguished before it reached the vaulted ceiling, an enormous trellis-work of sculptured beams, whose thousand figures seemed to move confusedly in the shadows, many candles were already lighted here and there on tables, and beaming on the heads of clerks buried in masses of documents.--*Paris*",
    "The anterior portion of the ball was occupied by the crowd; on the right and left were magistrates and tables; at the end, upon a platform, a number of judges, whose rear rank sank into the shadows, sinister and motionless faces.--*Paris*",
    "The walls were sown with innumerable fleurs-de-lis.--*Paris*",
    "A large figure of Christ might be vaguely descried above the judges, and everywhere there were pikes and halberds, upon whose points the reflection of the candles placed tips of fire.--*Paris*",
    "Here the bystanders imposed silence upon the two chatterers.--*Paris*",
    "They were listening to an important deposition.--*Paris*",
    "The old woman ceased.--*Paris*",
    "A murmur of horror ran through the audience.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire himself was not disinclined to regard this as altogether alarming and probable.--*Paris*",
    "The magistrate who had reminded Gringoire of a crocodile rose,----*Paris*",
    "A bailiff banded the dead leaf to the crocodile, who made a doleful shake of the head, and passed it on to the president, who gave it to the procurator of the king in the ecclesiastical court, and thus it made the circuit of the hail.--*Paris*",
    "A counsellor took up the word.--*Paris*",
    "A murmur ran through the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "But Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary to the king, interposed once more.--*Paris*",
    "This conclusive observation appeared to dissipate all the doubts of Gringoire and the other sceptics in the audience.--*Paris*",
    "At that name, the accused sprang up, her head rose above the throng.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire with horror recognized la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "She was pale; her tresses, formerly so gracefully braided and spangled with sequins, hung in disorder; her lips were blue, her hollow eyes were terrible.--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy girl fell back on her criminal's seat, speechless, tearless, white as a wax figure.--*Paris*",
    "The president bent down to a man at his feet, who wore a gold cap and a black gown, a chain on his neck and a wand in his hand.--*Paris*",
    "All eyes turned towards a small door, which opened, and, to the great agitation of Gringoire, gave passage to a pretty goat with horns and hoofs of gold.--*Paris*",
    "The elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold, stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it had before its eyes an immense horizon.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly it caught sight of the gypsy girl, and leaping over the table and the head of a clerk, in two bounds it was at her knees; then it rolled gracefully on its mistress's feet, soliciting a word or a caress; but the accused remained motionless, and poor Djali himself obtained not a glance.--*Paris*",
    "Jacques Charmolue interfered.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile the procurator had exclaimed: \"If the demon which possesses this goat, and which has resisted all exorcisms, persists in its deeds of witchcraft, if it alarms the court with them, we warn it that we shall be forced to put in requisition against it the gallows or the stake.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire broke out into a cold perspiration.--*Paris*",
    "Charmolue took from the table the gypsy's tambourine, and presenting it to the goat, in a certain manner, asked the latter,----*Paris*",
    "The goat looked at it with an intelligent eye, raised its gilded hoof, and struck seven blows.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, seven o'clock.--*Paris*",
    "A movement of terror ran through the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire could not endure it.--*Paris*",
    "Jacques Charmolue, by the aid of the same manoeuvres of the tambourine, made the goat perform many other tricks connected with the date of the day, the month of the year, etc., which the reader has already witnessed.--*Paris*",
    "And, by virtue of an optical illusion peculiar to judicial proceedings, these same spectators who had, probably, more than once applauded in the public square Djali's innocent magic were terrified by it beneath the roof of the Palais de Justice.--*Paris*",
    "The goat was undoubtedly the devil.--*Paris*",
    "It was far worse when the procurator of the king, having emptied upon a floor a certain bag filled with movable letters, which Djali wore round his neck, they beheld the goat extract with his hoof from the scattered alphabet the fatal name of Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "The witchcraft of which the captain had been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated, and in the eyes of all, the gypsy, that ravishing dancer, who had so often dazzled the passers-by with her grace, was no longer anything but a frightful vampire.--*Paris*",
    "However, she betrayed no sign of life; neither Djali's graceful evolutions, nor the menaces of the court, nor the suppressed imprecations of the spectators any longer reached her mind.--*Paris*",
    "In order to arouse her, a police officer was obliged to shake her unmercifully, and the president had to raise his voice,--\"Girl, you are of the Bohemian race, addicted to deeds of witchcraft.--*Paris*",
    "You, in complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit, during the night of the twenty-ninth of March last, murdered and stabbed, in concert with the powers of darkness, by the aid of charms and underhand practices, a captain of the king's arches of the watch, Phoebus de Chateaupers.--*Paris*",
    "Do you persist in denying it?\"--*Paris*",
    "The president continued squarely,----*Paris*",
    "She replied in a broken voice,----*Paris*",
    "Master Jacques Charmolue interposed sweetly,----*Paris*",
    "The unhappy girl quivered in every limb.--*Paris*",
    "But she rose at the command of the men with partisans, and walked with a tolerably firm step, preceded by Charmolue and the priests of the officiality, between two rows of halberds, towards a medium-sized door which suddenly opened and closed again behind her, and which produced upon the grief-stricken Gringoire the effect of a horrible mouth which had just devoured her.--*Paris*",
    "When she disappeared, they heard a plaintive bleating; it was the little goat mourning.--*Paris*",
    "The sitting of the court was suspended.--*Paris*",
    "A counsellor having remarked that the gentlemen were fatigued, and that it would be a long time to wait until the torture was at an end, the president replied that a magistrate must know how to sacrifice himself to his duty.--*Paris*",
    "Book 8 Chapter 2 Continuation Of The Crown Which Was Changed--*Paris*",
    "After ascending and descending several steps in the corridors, which were so dark that they were lighted by lamps at mid-day, La Esmeralda, still surrounded by her lugubrious escort, was thrust by the police into a gloomy chamber.--*Paris*",
    "This chamber, circular in form, occupied the ground floor of one of those great towers, which, even in our own century, still pierce through the layer of modern edifices with which modern Paris has covered ancient Paris.--*Paris*",
    "There were no windows to this cellar; no other opening than the entrance, which was low, and closed by an enormous iron door.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, light was not lacking; a furnace had been constructed in the thickness of the wall; a large fire was lighted there, which filled the vault with its crimson reflections and deprived a miserable candle, which stood in one corner, of all radiance.--*Paris*",
    "The iron grating which served to close the oven, being raised at that moment, allowed only a view at the mouth of the flaming vent-hole in the dark wall, the lower extremity of its bars, like a row of black and pointed teeth, set flat apart; which made the furnace resemble one of those mouths of dragons which spout forth flames in ancient legends.--*Paris*",
    "By the light which escaped from it, the prisoner beheld, all about the room, frightful instruments whose use she did not understand.--*Paris*",
    "In the centre lay a leather mattress, placed almost flat upon the ground, over which hung a strap provided with a buckle, attached to a brass ring in the mouth of a flat-nosed monster carved in the keystone of the vault.--*Paris*",
    "Tongs, pincers, large ploughshares, filled the interior of the furnace, and glowed in a confused heap on the coals.--*Paris*",
    "The sanguine light of the furnace illuminated in the chamber only a confused mass of horrible things.--*Paris*",
    "This Tartarus was called simply, The Question Chamber.--*Paris*",
    "On the bed, in a negligent attitude, sat Pierrat Torterue, the official torturer.--*Paris*",
    "His underlings, two gnomes with square faces, leather aprons, and linen breeches, were moving the iron instruments on the coals.--*Paris*",
    "In vain did the poor girl summon up her courage; on entering this chamber she was stricken with horror.--*Paris*",
    "The sergeants of the bailiff of the courts drew up in line on one side, the priests of the officiality on the other.--*Paris*",
    "A clerk, inkhorn, and a table were in one corner.--*Paris*",
    "Master Jacques Charmolue approached the gypsy with a very sweet smile.--*Paris*",
    "Pierrat rose with a growl.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, la Esmeralda had remained standing.--*Paris*",
    "That leather bed on which so many unhappy wretches had writhed, frightened her.--*Paris*",
    "Terror chilled the very marrow of her bones; she stood there bewildered and stupefied.--*Paris*",
    "At a sign from Charmolue, the two assistants took her and placed her in a sitting posture on the bed.--*Paris*",
    "They did her no harm; but when these men touched her, when that leather touched her, she felt all her blood retreat to her heart.--*Paris*",
    "She cast a frightened look around the chamber.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to her as though she beheld advancing from all quarters towards her, with the intention of crawling up her body and biting and pinching her, all those hideous implements of torture, which as compared to the instruments of all sorts she had hitherto seen, were like what bats, centipedes, and spiders are among insects and birds.--*Paris*",
    "She shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "This time she could only make a sign with her head.--*Paris*",
    "Charmolue hesitated for a moment with the ambiguous grimace of a poet in search of a rhyme.--*Paris*",
    "The unfortunate girl felt herself so utterly abandoned by God and men, that her head fell upon her breast like an inert thing which has no power in itself.--*Paris*",
    "The tormentor and the physician approached her simultaneously.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, the two assistants began to fumble among their hideous arsenal.--*Paris*",
    "At the clanking of their frightful irons, the unhappy child quivered like a dead frog which is being galvanized.--*Paris*",
    "Had the archdeacon been present, he certainly would have recalled at that moment his symbol of the spider and the fly.--*Paris*",
    "Soon the unfortunate girl, through a mist which spread before her eyes, beheld the boot approach; she soon beheld her foot encased between iron plates disappear in the frightful apparatus.--*Paris*",
    "Then terror restored her strength.--*Paris*",
    "She darted from the bed to fling herself at the feet of the king's procurator, but her leg was fast in the heavy block of oak and iron, and she sank down upon the boot, more crushed than a bee with a lump of lead on its wing.--*Paris*",
    "At a sign from Charmolue, she was replaced on the bed, and two coarse hands adjusted to her delicate waist the strap which hung from the ceiling.--*Paris*",
    "Pierrat turned the handle of the screw-jack, the boot was contracted, and the unhappy girl uttered one of those horrible cries which have no orthography in any human language.--*Paris*",
    "She had not calculated her strength when she faced the torture.--*Paris*",
    "Poor child, whose life up to that time had been so joyous, so pleasant, so sweet, the first pain had conquered her!--*Paris*",
    "Jacques Charmolue raised his voice,--*Paris*",
    "She raised her large, staring eyes to the magistrate, and replied, as though mechanically, without convulsion or agitation,----*Paris*",
    "It was evident that everything within her was broken.--*Paris*",
    "When the prisoner had been \"unbooted,\" the procurator of the ecclesiastical court examined her foot, which was still swollen with pain.--*Paris*",
    "Then he turned to his acolytes of the officiality,-- \"Behold justice enlightened at last!--*Paris*",
    "This is a solace, gentlemen!--*Paris*",
    "Madamoiselle will bear us witness that we have acted with all possible gentleness.\"--*Paris*",

    "When she re-entered the audience hall, pale and limping, she was received with a general murmur of pleasure.--*Paris*",
    "On the part of the audience there was the feeling of impatience gratified which one experiences at the theatre at the end of the last entr'acte of the comedy, when the curtain rises and the conclusion is about to begin.--*Paris*",
    "On the part of the judges, it was the hope of getting their suppers sooner.--*Paris*",
    "The little goat also bleated with joy.--*Paris*",
    "He tried to run towards his mistress, but they had tied him to the bench.--*Paris*",
    "Night was fully set in.--*Paris*",
    "The candles, whose number had not been increased, cast so little light, that the walls of the hall could not be seen.--*Paris*",
    "The shadows there enveloped all objects in a sort of mist.--*Paris*",
    "A few apathetic faces of judges alone could be dimly discerned.--*Paris*",
    "Opposite them, at the extremity of the long hail, they could see a vaguely white point standing out against the sombre background.--*Paris*",
    "This was the accused.--*Paris*",
    "She had dragged herself to her place.--*Paris*",
    "When Charmolue had installed himself in a magisterial manner in his own, he seated himself, then rose and said, without exhibiting too much self-complacency at his success,--\"The accused has confessed all.\"--*Paris*",
    "Her heart contracted.--*Paris*",
    "She was heard to sob amid the darkness.--*Paris*",
    "Master Charmolue exhibited an alarming note book, and began to read, with many gestures and the exaggerated accentuation of the pleader, an oration in Latin, wherein all the proofs of the suit were piled up in Ciceronian periphrases, flanked with quotations from Plautus, his favorite comic author.--*Paris*",
    "We regret that we are not able to offer to our readers this remarkable piece.--*Paris*",
    "The orator pronounced it with marvellous action.--*Paris*",
    "Before he had finished the exordium, the perspiration was starting from his brow, and his eyes from his bead.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, in the middle of a fine period, he interrupted himself, and his glance, ordinarily so gentle and even stupid, became menacing.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, he pointed to the little goat, who, on seeing Charmolue gesticulating, had, in point of fact, thought it appropriate to do the same, and had seated himself on his haunches, reproducing to the best of his ability, with his forepaws and his bearded head the pathetic pantomine of the king's procurator in the ecclesiastical court.--*Paris*",
    "This was, if the reader remembers, one of his prettiest accomplishments.--*Paris*",
    "This incident, this last proof, produced a great effect.--*Paris*",
    "The goat's hoofs were tied, and the king's procurator resumed the thread of his eloquence.--*Paris*",
    "It was very long, but the peroration was admirable.--*Paris*",
    "Here is the concluding phrase; let the reader add the hoarse voice and the breathless gestures of Master Charmolue,--*Paris*",
    "He put on his cap again and seated himself.--*Paris*",
    "Another man in a black gown rose near the accused; he was her lawyer.--The judges, who were fasting, began to grumble.--*Paris*",
    "They proceeded to take a vote without leaving the room.--*Paris*",
    "The judges signified their assent without giving their reasons, they were in a hurry.--*Paris*",
    "Their capped heads were seen uncovering one after the other, in the gloom, at the lugubrious question addressed to them by the president in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "The poor accused had the appearance of looking at them, but her troubled eye no longer saw.--*Paris*",
    "Then the clerk began to write; then he handed a long parch- ment to the president.--*Paris*",
    "Then the unhappy girl heard the people moving, the pikes clashing, and a freezing voice saying to her,--\"Bohemian wench, on the day when it shall seem good to our lord the king, at the hour of noon, you will be taken in a tumbrel, in your shift, with bare feet, and a rope about your neck, before the grand portal of Notre-Dame, and you will there make an apology with a wax torch of the weight of two pounds in your hand, and thence you will be conducted to the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, where you will be hanged and strangled on the town gibbet; and likewise your goat; and you will pay to the official three lions of gold, in reparation of the crimes by you committed and by you confessed, of sorcery and magic, debauchery and murder, upon the person of the Sieur Phoebus de Chateaupers.--*Paris*",

    "Book 8 Chapter 4 Leave All Hope Behind ,Ye Who Enter Here--*Paris*",
    "In the Middle Ages, when an edifice was complete, there was almost as much of it in the earth as above it.--*Paris*",
    "Unless built upon piles, like Notre-Dame, a palace, a fortress, a church, had always a double bottom.--*Paris*",
    "In cathedrals, it was, in some sort, another subterranean cathedral, low, dark, mysterious, blind, and mute, under the upper nave which was overflowing with light and reverberating with organs and bells day and night.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes it was a sepulchre.--*Paris*",
    "In palaces, in fortresses, it was a prison, sometimes a sepulchre also, sometimes both together.--*Paris*",
    "These mighty buildings, whose mode of formation and vegetation we have elsewhere explained, had not simply foundations, but, so to speak, roots which ran branching through the soil in chambers, galleries, and staircases, like the construction above.--*Paris*",
    "Thus churches, palaces, fortresses, had the earth half way up their bodies.--*Paris*",
    "The cellars of an edifice formed another edifice, into which one descended instead of ascending, and which extended its subterranean grounds under the external piles of the monument, like those forests and mountains which are reversed in the mirror-like waters of a lake, beneath the forests and mountains of the banks.--*Paris*",
    "At the fortress of Saint-Antoine, at the Palais de Justice of Paris, at the Louvre, these subterranean edifices were prisons.--*Paris*",
    "The stories of these prisons, as they sank into the soil, grew constantly narrower and more gloomy.--*Paris*",
    "They were so many zones, where the shades of horror were graduated.--*Paris*",
    "Dante could never imagine anything better for his hell.--*Paris*",
    "These tunnels of cells usually terminated in a sack of a lowest dungeon, with a vat-like bottom, where Dante placed Satan, where society placed those condemned to death.--*Paris*",
    "A miserable human existence, once interred there; farewell light, air, life, ~ogni speranza~--every hope; it only came forth to the scaffold or the stake.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes it rotted there; human justice called this \"forgetting.\"--*Paris*",
    "Between men and himself, the condemned man felt a pile of stones and jailers weighing down upon his head; and the entire prison, the massive bastille was nothing more than an enormous, complicated lock, which barred him off from the rest of the world.--*Paris*",
    "It was in a sloping cavity of this description, in the ~oubliettes~ excavated by Saint-Louis, in the ~inpace~ of the Tournelle, that la Esmeralda had been placed on being condemned to death, through fear of her escape, no doubt, with the colossal court-house over her head.--*Paris*",
    "Poor fly, who could not have lifted even one of its blocks of stone!--*Paris*",
    "Assuredly, Providence and society had been equally unjust; such an excess of unhappiness and of torture was not necessary to break so frail a creature.--*Paris*",
    "There she lay, lost in the shadows, buried, hidden, immured.--*Paris*",
    "Any one who could have beheld her in this state, after having seen her laugh and dance in the sun, would have shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "Cold as night, cold as death, not a breath of air in her tresses, not a human sound in her ear, no longer a ray of light in her eyes; snapped in twain, crushed with chains, crouching beside a jug and a loaf, on a little straw, in a pool of water, which was formed under her by the sweating of the prison walls; without motion, almost without breath, she had no longer the power to suffer; Phoebus, the sun, midday, the open air, the streets of Paris, the dances with applause, the sweet babblings of love with the officer; then the priest, the old crone, the poignard, the blood, the torture, the gibbet; all this did, indeed, pass before her mind, sometimes as a charming and golden vision, sometimes as a hideous nightmare; but it was no longer anything but a vague and horrible struggle, lost in the gloom, or distant music played up above ground, and which was no longer audible at the depth where the unhappy girl had fallen.--*Paris*",
    "Since she had been there, she had neither waked nor slept.--*Paris*",
    "In that misfortune, in that cell, she could no longer distinguish her waking hours from slumber, dreams from reality, any more than day from night.--*Paris*",
    "All this was mixed, broken, floating, disseminated confusedly in her thought.--*Paris*",
    "She no longer felt, she no longer knew, she no longer thought; at the most, she only dreamed.--*Paris*",
    "Never had a living creature been thrust more deeply into nothingness.--*Paris*",
    "Thus benumbed, frozen, petrified, she had barely noticed on two or three occasions, the sound of a trap door opening somewhere above her, without even permitting the passage of a little light, and through which a hand had tossed her a bit of black bread.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, this periodical visit of the jailer was the sole communication which was left her with mankind.--*Paris*",
    "A single thing still mechanically occupied her ear; above her head, the dampness was filtering through the mouldy stones of the vault, and a drop of water dropped from them at regular intervals.--*Paris*",
    "She listened stupidly to the noise made by this drop of water as it fell into the pool beside her.--*Paris*",
    "This drop of water falling from time to time into that pool, was the only movement which still went on around her, the only clock which marked the time, the only noise which reached her of all the noise made on the surface of the earth.--*Paris*",
    "To tell the whole, however, she also felt, from time to time, in that cesspool of mire and darkness, something cold passing over her foot or her arm, and she shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "How long had she been there?--*Paris*",
    "She did not know.--*Paris*",
    "She had a recollection of a sentence of death pronounced somewhere, against some one, then of having been herself carried away, and of waking up in darkness and silence, chilled to the heart.--*Paris*",
    "She had dragged herself along on her hands.--*Paris*",
    "Then iron rings that cut her ankles, and chains had rattled.--*Paris*",
    "She had recognized the fact that all around her was wall, that below her there was a pavement covered with moisture and a truss of straw; but neither lamp nor air-hole.--*Paris*",
    "Then she had seated herself on that straw and, sometimes, for the sake of changing her attitude, on the last stone step in her dungeon.--*Paris*",
    "For a while she had tried to count the black minutes measured off for her by the drop of water; but that melancholy labor of an ailing brain had broken off of itself in her head, and had left her in stupor.--*Paris*",
    "At length, one day, or one night, (for midnight and midday were of the same color in that sepulchre), she heard above her a louder noise than was usually made by the turnkey when he brought her bread and jug of water.--*Paris*",
    "She raised her head, and beheld a ray of reddish light passing through the crevices in the sort of trapdoor contrived in the roof of the ~inpace~.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, the heavy lock creaked, the trap grated on its rusty hinges, turned, and she beheld a lantern, a hand, and the lower portions of the bodies of two men, the door being too low to admit of her seeing their heads.--*Paris*",
    "The light pained her so acutely that she shut her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "When she opened them again the door was closed, the lantern was deposited on one of the steps of the staircase; a man alone stood before her.--*Paris*",
    "A monk's black cloak fell to his feet, a cowl of the same color concealed his face.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing was visible of his person, neither face nor hands.--*Paris*",
    "It was a long, black shroud standing erect, and beneath which something could be felt moving.--*Paris*",
    "She gazed fixedly for several minutes at this sort of spectre.--*Paris*",
    "But neither he nor she spoke.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced them two statues confronting each other.--*Paris*",
    "Two things only seemed alive in that cavern; the wick of the lantern, which sputtered on account of the dampness of the atmosphere, and the drop of water from the roof, which cut this irregular sputtering with its monotonous splash, and made the light of the lantern quiver in concentric waves on the oily water of the pool.--*Paris*",
    "At last the prisoner broke the silence.--*Paris*",
    "The words, the accent, the sound of his voice made her tremble.--*Paris*",
    "The priest continued, in a hollow voice,----*Paris*",
    "Her head, which had been raised with joy, fell back upon her breast.--*Paris*",
    "She took her feet in her hands, a gesture habitual with unhappy wretches who are cold, as we have already seen in the case of the recluse of the Tour-Roland, and her teeth chattered.--*Paris*",
    "The priest appeared to cast his eyes around the dungeon from beneath his cowl.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she began to weep like a child.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, the priest took her arm.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy girl was frozen to her very soul.--*Paris*",
    "Yet that hand produced an impression of cold upon her.--*Paris*",
    "The priest threw back his cowl; she looked.--*Paris*",
    "It was the sinister visage which had so long pursued her; that demon's head which had appeared at la Falourdel's, above the head of her adored Phoebus; that eye which she last had seen glittering beside a dagger.--*Paris*",
    "This apparition, always so fatal for her, and which had thus driven her on from misfortune to misfortune, even to torture, roused her from her stupor.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to her that the sort of veil which had lain thick upon her memory was rent away.--*Paris*",
    "All the details of her melancholy adventure, from the nocturnal scene at la Falourdel's to her condemnation to the Tournelle, recurred to her memory, no longer vague and confused as heretofore, but distinct, harsh, clear, palpitating, terrible.--*Paris*",
    "These souvenirs, half effaced and almost obliterated by excess of suffering, were revived by the sombre figure which stood before her, as the approach of fire causes letters traced upon white paper with invisible ink, to start out perfectly fresh.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to her that all the wounds of her heart opened and bled simultaneously.--*Paris*",
    "Then she dropped her arms in discouragement, and remained seated, with lowered head, eyes fixed on the ground, mute and still trembling.--*Paris*",
    "The priest gazed at her with the eye of a hawk which has long been soaring in a circle from the heights of heaven over a poor lark cowering in the wheat, and has long been silently contracting the formidable circles of his flight, and has suddenly swooped down upon his prey like a flash of lightning, and holds it panting in his talons.--*Paris*",
    "She began to murmur in a low voice,----*Paris*",
    "She made no reply.--*Paris*",
    "Her lips contracted, as though with a smile.--*Paris*",
    "Here, bursting into sobs, and raising her eyes to the priest,----*Paris*",
    "Her tears suddenly ceased, she gazed at him with the look of an idiot.--*Paris*",
    "He had fallen on his knees and was devouring her with eyes of flame.--*Paris*",
    "He resumed,----*Paris*",
    "Both remained silent for several minutes, crushed beneath the weight of their emotions; he maddened, she stupefied.--*Paris*",
    "Here the priest paused, and the prisoner heard sighs of anguish break from his breast with a sound of the death rattle.--*Paris*",
    "He resumed,----*Paris*",
    "The priest paused for a moment, overcome with emotion.--*Paris*",
    "Then he continued,----*Paris*",
    "Here the priest looked the prisoner full in the face, and added, coldly,----*Paris*",
    "He made another pause and went on,----*Paris*",
    "He ceased.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl could find but one word:--*Paris*",
    "He opened his cassock.--*Paris*",
    "His breast was in fact, mangled as by the claw of a tiger, and on his side he had a large and badly healed wound.--*Paris*",
    "The prisoner recoiled with horror.--*Paris*",
    "The priest writhed on the wet pavement, beating his head against the corners of the stone steps.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl gazed at him, and listened to him.--*Paris*",
    "When he ceased, exhausted and panting, she repeated in a low voice,----*Paris*",
    "The priest dragged himself towards her on his knees.--*Paris*",
    "She interrupted with a terrible and thrilling laugh.--*Paris*",
    "The priest remained for several moments as though petrified, with his eyes fixed upon his hand.--*Paris*",
    "He seized her arm, he was beside himself, he tried to drag her away.--*Paris*",
    "She fixed her eye intently on him.--*Paris*",
    "He was not listening to her.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl flung herself upon him like a raging tigress, and pushed him upon the steps of the staircase with supernatural force.--*Paris*",
    "The priest had stumbled on the stairs.--*Paris*",
    "He silently disentangled his feet from the folds of his robe, picked up his lantern again, and slowly began the ascent of the steps which led to the door; he opened the door and passed through it.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, the young girl beheld his head reappear; it wore a frightful expression, and he cried, hoarse with rage and despair,----*Paris*",
    "She fell face downwards upon the floor, and there was no longer any sound audible in the cell than the sob of the drop of water which made the pool palpitate amid the darkness.--*Paris*",
    "Book 8 Chapter 5 The MOther--*Paris*",
    "I do not believe that there is anything sweeter in the world than the ideas which awake in a mother's heart at the sight of her child's tiny shoe; especially if it is a shoe for festivals, for Sunday, for baptism, the shoe embroidered to the very sole, a shoe in which the infant has not yet taken a step.--*Paris*",
    "That shoe has so much grace and daintiness, it is so impossible for it to walk, that it seems to the mother as though she saw her child.--*Paris*",
    "She smiles upon it, she kisses it, she talks to it; she asks herself whether there can actually be a foot so tiny; and if the child be absent, the pretty shoe suffices to place the sweet and fragile creature before her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "She thinks she sees it, she does see it, complete, living, joyous, with its delicate hands, its round head, its pure lips, its serene eyes whose white is blue.--*Paris*",
    "If it is in winter, it is yonder, crawling on the carpet, it is laboriously climbing upon an ottoman, and the mother trembles lest it should approach the fire.--*Paris*",
    "If it is summer time, it crawls about the yard, in the garden, plucks up the grass between the paving-stones, gazes innocently at the big dogs, the big horses, without fear, plays with the shells, with the flowers, and makes the gardener grumble because he finds sand in the flower-beds and earth in the paths.--*Paris*",
    "Everything laughs, and shines and plays around it, like it, even the breath of air and the ray of sun which vie with each other in disporting among the silky ringlets of its hair.--*Paris*",
    "The shoe shows all this to the mother, and makes her heart melt as fire melts wax.--*Paris*",
    "But when the child is lost, these thousand images of joy, of charms, of tenderness, which throng around the little shoe, become so many horrible things.--*Paris*",
    "The pretty broidered shoe is no longer anything but an instrument of torture which eternally crushes the heart of the mother.--*Paris*",
    "It is always the same fibre which vibrates, the tenderest and most sensitive; but instead of an angel caressing it, it is a demon who is wrenching at it.--*Paris*",
    "One May morning, when the sun was rising on one of those dark blue skies against which Garofolo loves to place his Descents from the Cross, the recluse of the Tour-Roland heard a sound of wheels, of horses and irons in the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "She was somewhat aroused by it, knotted her hair upon her ears in order to deafen herself, and resumed her contemplation, on her knees, of the inanimate object which she had adored for fifteen years.--*Paris*",
    "This little shoe was the universe to her, as we have already said.--*Paris*",
    "Her thought was shut up in it, and was destined never more to quit it except at death.--*Paris*",
    "The sombre cave of the Tour-Roland alone knew how many bitter imprecations, touching complaints, prayers and sobs she had wafted to heaven in connection with that charming bauble of rose-colored satin.--*Paris*",
    "Never was more despair bestowed upon a prettier and more graceful thing.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed as though her grief were breaking forth more violently than usual; and she could be heard outside lamenting in a loud and monotonous voice which rent the heart.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy woman flung herself upon that shoe; her consolation and her despair for so many years, and her vitals were rent with sobs as on the first day; because, for a mother who has lost her child, it is always the first day.--*Paris*",
    "That grief never grows old.--*Paris*",
    "The mourning garments may grow white and threadbare, the heart remains dark.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the fresh and joyous cries of children passed in front of the cell.--*Paris*",
    "Every time that children crossed her vision or struck her ear, the poor mother flung herself into the darkest corner of her sepulchre, and one would have said, that she sought to plunge her head into the stone in order not to hear them.--*Paris*",
    "This time, on the contrary, she drew herself upright with a start, and listened eagerly.--*Paris*",
    "One of the little boys had just said,----*Paris*",
    "With the abrupt leap of that spider which we have seen fling itself upon a fly at the trembling of its web, she rushed to her air-hole, which opened as the reader knows, on the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "A ladder had, in fact, been raised up against the permanent gibbet, and the hangman's assistant was busying himself with adjusting the chains which had been rusted by the rain.--*Paris*",
    "There were some people standing about.--*Paris*",
    "The laughing group of children was already far away.--*Paris*",
    "The sacked nun sought with her eyes some passer-by whom she might question.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, beside her cell, she perceived a priest making a pretext of reading the public breviary, but who was much less occupied with the \"lectern of latticed iron,\" than with the gallows, toward which he cast a fierce and gloomy glance from time to time.--*Paris*",
    "She recognized monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, a holy man.--*Paris*",
    "The priest looked at her and made no reply; she repeated her question.--*Paris*",
    "Then he said,----*Paris*",
    "Then Paquette la Chantefleurie burst into hyena-like laughter.--*Paris*",
    "She was frightful.--*Paris*",
    "The priest looked at her coldly.--*Paris*",
    "His head fell upon his bosom and he moved slowly away.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse writhed her arms with joy.--*Paris*",
    "And she began to pace up and down with long strides before the grating of her window, her hair dishevelled, her eyes flashing, with her shoulder striking against the wall, with the wild air of a female wolf in a cage, who has long been famished, and who feels the hour for her repast drawing near.--*Paris*",
    "Book 8 Chapter 6 Three Human Hearts Differently Constructed--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus was not dead, however.--*Paris*",
    "Men of that stamp die hard.--*Paris*",
    "When Master Philippe Lheulier, advocate extraordinary of the king, had said to poor Esmeralda; \"He is dying,\" it was an error or a jest.--*Paris*",
    "When the archdeacon had repeated to the condemned girl; \"He is dead,\" the fact is that he knew nothing about it, but that he believed it, that he counted on it, that he did not doubt it, that he devoutly hoped it.--*Paris*",
    "It would have been too hard for him to give favorable news of his rival to the woman whom he loved.--*Paris*",
    "Any man would have done the same in his place.--*Paris*",
    "It was not that Phoebus's wound had not been serious, but it had not been as much so as the archdeacon believed.--*Paris*",
    "The physician, to whom the soldiers of the watch had carried him at the first moment, had feared for his life during the space of a week, and had even told him so in Latin.--*Paris*",
    "But youth had gained the upper hand; and, as frequently happens, in spite of prognostications and diagnoses, nature had amused herself by saving the sick man under the physician's very nose.--*Paris*",
    "It was while he was still lying on the leech's pallet that he had submitted to the interrogations of Philippe Lheulier and the official inquisitors, which had annoyed him greatly.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, one fine morning, feeling himself better, he had left his golden spurs with the leech as payment, and had slipped away.--*Paris*",
    "This had not, however, interfered with the progress of the affair.--*Paris*",
    "Justice, at that epoch, troubled itself very little about the clearness and definiteness of a criminal suit.--*Paris*",
    "Provided that the accused was hung, that was all that was necessary.--*Paris*",
    "Now the judge had plenty of proofs against la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "They had supposed Phoebus to be dead, and that was the end of the matter.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus, on his side, had not fled far.--*Paris*",
    "He had simply rejoined his company in garrison at Queue-en-Brie, in the Isle-de-France, a few stages from Paris.--*Paris*",
    "After all, it did not please him in the least to appear in this suit.--*Paris*",
    "He had a vague feeling that be should play a ridiculous figure in it.--*Paris*",
    "On the whole, he did not know what to think of the whole affair.--*Paris*",
    "Superstitious, and not given to devoutness, like every soldier who is only a soldier, when he came to question himself about this adventure, he did not feel assured as to the goat, as to the singular fashion in which he had met La Esmeralda, as to the no less strange manner in which she had allowed him to divine her love, as to her character as a gypsy, and lastly, as to the surly monk.--*Paris*",
    "He perceived in all these incidents much more magic than love, probably a sorceress, perhaps the devil; a comedy, in short, or to speak in the language of that day, a very disagreeable mystery, in which he played a very awkward part, the role of blows and derision.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was quite put out of countenance about it; he experienced that sort of shame which our La Fontaine has so admirably defined,----*Paris*",
    "Ashamed as a fox who has been caught by a fowl.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he hoped that the affair would not get noised abroad, that his name would hardly be pronounced in it, and that in any case it would not go beyond the courts of the Tournelle.--*Paris*",
    "In this he was not mistaken, there was then no \"Gazette des Tribunaux;\" and as not a week passed which had not its counterfeiter to boil, or its witch to hang, or its heretic to burn, at some one of the innumerable justices of Paris, people were so accustomed to seeing in all the squares the ancient feudal Themis, bare armed, with sleeves stripped up, performing her duty at the gibbets, the ladders, and the pillories, that they hardly paid any heed to it.--*Paris*",
    "Fashionable society of that day hardly knew the name of the victim who passed by at the corner of the street, and it was the populace at the most who regaled themselves with this coarse fare.--*Paris*",
    "An execution was an habitual incident of the public highways, like the braising-pan of the baker or the slaughter-house of the knacker.--*Paris*",
    "The executioner was only a sort of butcher of a little deeper dye than the rest.--*Paris*",
    "Hence Phoebus's mind was soon at ease on the score of the enchantress Esmeralda, or Similar, as he called her, concerning the blow from the dagger of the Bohemian or of the surly monk (it mattered little which to him), and as to the issue of the trial.--*Paris*",
    "But as soon as his heart was vacant in that direction, Fleur-de-Lys returned to it.--*Paris*",
    "Captain Phoebus's heart, like the physics of that day, abhorred a vacuum.--*Paris*",
    "Queue-en-Brie was a very insipid place to stay at then, a village of farriers, and cow-girls with chapped hands, a long line of poor dwellings and thatched cottages, which borders the grand road on both sides for half a league; a tail (queue), in short, as its name imports.--*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys was his last passion but one, a pretty girl, a charming dowry; accordingly, one fine morning, quite cured, and assuming that, after the lapse of two months, the Bohemian affair must be completely finished and forgotten, the amorous cavalier arrived on a prancing horse at the door of the Gondelaurier mansion.--*Paris*",
    "He paid no attention to a tolerably numerous rabble which had assembled in the Place du Parvis, before the portal of Notre-Dame; he remembered that it was the month of May; he supposed that it was some procession, some Pentecost, some festival, hitched his horse to the ring at the door, and gayly ascended the stairs to his beautiful betrothed.--*Paris*",
    "She was alone with her mother.--*Paris*",
    "The scene of the witch, her goat, her cursed alphabet, and Phoebus's long absences, still weighed on Fleur-de-Lys's heart.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, when she beheld her captain enter, she thought him so handsome, his doublet so new, his baldrick so shining, and his air so impassioned, that she blushed with pleasure.--*Paris*",
    "The noble damsel herself was more charming than ever.--*Paris*",
    "Her magnificent blond hair was plaited in a ravishing manner, she was dressed entirely in that sky blue which becomes fair people so well, a bit of coquetry which she had learned from Colombe, and her eyes were swimming in that languor of love which becomes them still better.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus, who had seen nothing in the line of beauty, since he left the village maids of Queue-en-Brie, was intoxicated with Fleur-de-Lys, which imparted to our officer so eager and gallant an air, that his peace was immediately made.--*Paris*",
    "Madame de Gondelaurier herself, still maternally seated in her big arm- chair, had not the heart to scold him.--*Paris*",
    "As for Fleur-de-Lys's reproaches, they expired in tender cooings.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl was seated near the window still embroidering her grotto of Neptune.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was leaning over the back of her chair, and she was addressing her caressing reproaches to him in a low voice.--*Paris*",
    "She could not repress a smile.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus was delighted with the first question, which helped him to avoid the second.--*Paris*",
    "Here Phoebus was rather seriously embarrassed.--*Paris*",
    "She poor child was completely upset.--*Paris*",
    "The mendacious captain was perfectly well aware that an affair of honor always makes a man stand well in the eyes of a woman.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, Fleur-de-Lys looked him full in the face, all agitated with fear, pleasure, and admiration.--*Paris*",
    "Still, she was not completely reassured.--*Paris*",
    "Here Phoebus, whose imagination was endowed with but mediocre power of creation, began to find himself in a quandary as to a means of extricating himself for his prowess.--*Paris*",
    "He approached the window.--*Paris*",
    "The captain was so thoroughly persuaded that la Esmeralda's affair was concluded, that he was but little disturbed by Fleur- de-Lys's words.--*Paris*",
    "Still, he asked her one or two questions.--*Paris*",
    "She shrugged her white shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "The two lovers were not listening to the venerable dowager.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus had returned and was leaning on the back of his betrothed's chair, a charming post whence his libertine glance plunged into all the openings of Fleur-de-Lys's gorget.--*Paris*",
    "This gorget gaped so conveniently, and allowed him to see so many exquisite things and to divine so many more, that Phoebus, dazzled by this skin with its gleams of satin, said to himself, \"How can any one love anything but a fair skin?\"--*Paris*",
    "Both were silent.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl raised sweet, enraptured eyes to him from time to time, and their hair mingled in a ray of spring sunshine.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the good mother, charmed to see the betrothed pair on terms of such perfect understanding, had just quitted the apartment to attend to some domestic matter; Phoebus observed it, and this so emboldened the adventurous captain that very strange ideas mounted to his brain.--*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys loved him, he was her betrothed; she was alone with him; his former taste for her had re-awakened, not with all its fresh- ness but with all its ardor; after all, there is no great harm in tasting one's wheat while it is still in the blade; I do not know whether these ideas passed through his mind, but one thing is certain, that Fleur-de-Lys was suddenly alarmed by the expression of his glance.--*Paris*",
    "She looked round and saw that her mother was no longer there.--*Paris*",
    "And like a fawn who feels the breath of the pack of hounds, she rose, ran to the window, opened it, and rushed upon the balcony.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus, much discomfited, followed her.--*Paris*",
    "The Place du Parvis Notre-Dame, upon which the balcony looked, as the reader knows, presented at that moment a singular and sinister spectacle which caused the fright of the timid Fleur-de-Lys to change its nature.--*Paris*",
    "An immense crowd, which overflowed into all the neighboring streets, encumbered the Place, properly speaking.--*Paris*",
    "The little wall, breast high, which surrounded the Place, would not have sufficed to keep it free had it not been lined with a thick hedge of sergeants and hackbuteers, culverines in hand.--*Paris*",
    "Thanks to this thicket of pikes and arquebuses, the Parvis was empty.--*Paris*",
    "Its entrance was guarded by a force of halberdiers with the armorial bearings of the bishop.--*Paris*",
    "The large doors of the church were closed, and formed a contrast with the innumerable windows on the Place, which, open to their very gables, allowed a view of thousands of heads heaped up almost like the piles of bullets in a park of artillery.--*Paris*",
    "The surface of this rabble was dingy, dirty, earthy.--*Paris*",
    "The spectacle which it was expecting was evidently one of the sort which possess the privilege of bringing out and calling together the vilest among the populace.--*Paris*",
    "Nothing is so hideous as the noise which was made by that swarm of yellow caps and dirty heads.--*Paris*",
    "In that throng there were more laughs than cries, more women than men.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time, a sharp and vibrating voice pierced the general clamor.--*Paris*",
    "This thought filled with sadness the glance which she cast upon the populace.--*Paris*",
    "The captain, much more occupied with her than with that pack of the rabble, was amorously rumpling her girdle behind.--*Paris*",
    "She turned round, entreating and smiling.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, midday rang slowly out from the clock of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "A murmur of satisfaction broke out in the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "The last vibration of the twelfth stroke had hardly died away when all heads surged like the waves beneath a squall, and an immense shout went up from the pavement, the windows, and the roofs,--*Paris*",
    "Fleur-de-Lys pressed her hands to her eyes, that she might not see.--*Paris*",
    "A tumbrel drawn by a stout Norman horse, and all surrounded by cavalry in violet livery with white crosses, had just debouched upon the Place through the Rue Saint-Pierre- aux-Boeufs.--*Paris*",
    "The sergeants of the watch were clearing a passage for it through the crowd, by stout blows from their clubs.--*Paris*",
    "Beside the cart rode several officers of justice and police, recognizable by their black costume and their awkwardness in the saddle.--*Paris*",
    "Master Jacques Charmolue paraded at their head.--*Paris*",
    "In the fatal cart sat a young girl with her arms tied behind her back, and with no priest beside her.--*Paris*",
    "She was in her shift; her long black hair (the fashion then was to cut it off only at the foot of the gallows) fell in disorder upon her half-bared throat and shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "Athwart that waving hair, more glossy than the plumage of a raven, a thick, rough, gray rope was visible, twisted and knotted, chafing her delicate collar-bones and twining round the charming neck of the poor girl, like an earthworm round a flower.--*Paris*",
    "Beneath that rope glittered a tiny amulet ornamented with bits of green glass, which had been left to her no doubt, because nothing is refused to those who are about to die.--*Paris*",
    "The spectators in the windows could see in the bottom of the cart her naked legs which she strove to hide beneath her, as by a final feminine instinct.--*Paris*",
    "At her feet lay a little goat, bound.--*Paris*",
    "The condemned girl held together with her teeth her imperfectly fastened shift.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she suffered still more in her misery from being thus exposed almost naked to the eyes of all.--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "modesty is not made for such shocks.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, she turned to Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "His eyes were fixed on the tumbrel.--*Paris*",
    "He was very pale.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus interrupted her.--*Paris*",
    "He made a step to re-enter the room, but Fleur-de-Lys, whose jealousy, previously so vividly aroused by this same gypsy, had just been re-awakened, Fleur-de-Lys gave him a look full of penetration and distrust.--*Paris*",
    "She vaguely recalled at that moment having heard of a captain mixed up in the trial of that witch.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus forced a sneer,----*Paris*",
    "The unlucky captain was obliged to remain.--*Paris*",
    "He was somewhat reassured by the fact that the condemned girl never removed her eyes from the bottom of the cart.--*Paris*",
    "It was but too surely la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "In this last stage of opprobrium and misfortune, she was still beautiful; her great black eyes appeared still larger, because of the emaciation of her cheeks; her pale profile was pure and sublime.--*Paris*",
    "She resembled what she had been, in the same degree that a virgin by Masaccio, resembles a virgin of Raphael,--weaker, thinner, more delicate.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, there was nothing in her which was not shaken in some sort, and which with the exception of her modesty, she did not let go at will, so profoundly had she been broken by stupor and despair.--*Paris*",
    "Her body bounded at every jolt of the tumbrel like a dead or broken thing; her gaze was dull and imbecile.--*Paris*",
    "A tear was still visible in her eyes, but motionless and frozen, so to speak.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the lugubrious cavalcade has traversed the crowd amid cries of joy and curious attitudes.--*Paris*",
    "But as a faithful historian, we must state that on beholding her so beautiful, so depressed, many were moved with pity, even among the hardest of them.--*Paris*",
    "The tumbrel had entered the Parvis.--*Paris*",
    "It halted before the central portal.--*Paris*",
    "The escort ranged themselves in line on both sides.--*Paris*",
    "The crowd became silent, and, in the midst of this silence full of anxiety and solemnity, the two leaves of the grand door swung back, as of themselves, on their hinges, which gave a creak like the sound of a fife.--*Paris*",
    "Then there became visible in all its length, the deep, gloomy church, hung in black, sparely lighted with a few candles gleaming afar off on the principal altar, opened in the midst of the Place which was dazzling with light, like the mouth of a cavern.--*Paris*",
    "At the very extremity, in the gloom of the apse, a gigantic silver cross was visible against a black drapery which hung from the vault to the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "The whole nave was deserted.--*Paris*",
    "But a few heads of priests could be seen moving confusedly in the distant choir stalls, and, at the moment when the great door opened, there escaped from the church a loud, solemn, and monotonous chanting, which cast over the head of the condemned girl, in gusts, fragments of melancholy psalms,----*Paris*",
    "At the same time, another voice, separate from the choir, intoned upon the steps of the chief altar, this melancholy offertory,---*Paris*",
    "This chant, which a few old men buried in the gloom sang from afar over that beautiful creature, full of youth and life, caressed by the warm air of spring, inundated with sunlight was the mass for the dead.--*Paris*",
    "The people listened devoutly.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy girl seemed to lose her sight and her consciousness in the obscure interior of the church.--*Paris*",
    "Her white lips moved as though in prayer, and the headsman's assistant who approached to assist her to alight from the cart, heard her repeating this word in a low tone,--\"Phoebus.\"--*Paris*",
    "They untied her hands, made her alight, accompanied by her goat, which had also been unbound, and which bleated with joy at finding itself free: and they made her walk barefoot on the hard pavement to the foot of the steps leading to the door.--*Paris*",
    "The rope about her neck trailed behind her.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said it was a serpent following her.--*Paris*",
    "Then the chanting in the church ceased.--*Paris*",
    "A great golden cross and a row of wax candles began to move through the gloom.--*Paris*",
    "The halberds of the motley beadles clanked; and, a few moments later, a long procession of priests in chasubles, and deacons in dalmatics, marched gravely towards the condemned girl, as they drawled their song, spread out before her view and that of the crowd.--*Paris*",
    "But her glance rested on the one who marched at the head, immediately after the cross-bearer.--*Paris*",
    "It was in fact, the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "On his left he had the sub- chanter, on his right, the chanter, armed with his official wand.--*Paris*",
    "He advanced with head thrown back, his eyes fixed and wide open, intoning in a strong voice,----*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he made his appearance in the full daylight beneath the lofty arched portal, enveloped in an ample cope of silver barred with a black cross, he was so pale that more than one person in the crowd thought that one of the marble bishops who knelt on the sepulchral stones of the choir had risen and was come to receive upon the brink of the tomb, the woman who was about to die.--*Paris*",
    "She, no less pale, no less like a statue, had hardly noticed that they had placed in her hand a heavy, lighted candle of yellow wax; she had not heard the yelping voice of the clerk reading the fatal contents of the apology; when they told her to respond with Amen, she responded Amen.--*Paris*",
    "She only recovered life and force when she beheld the priest make a sign to her guards to withdraw, and himself advance alone towards her.--*Paris*",
    "Then she felt her blood boil in her head, and a remnant of indignation flashed up in that soul already benumbed and cold.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon approached her slowly; even in that extremity, she beheld him cast an eye sparkling with sensuality, jealousy, and desire, over her exposed form.--*Paris*",
    "Then he said aloud,----*Paris*",
    "He bent down to her ear, and added (the spectators supposed that he was receiving her last confession): \"Will you have me?--*Paris*",
    "I can still save you!\"--*Paris*",
    "She looked intently at him: \"Begone, demon, or I will denounce you!\"--*Paris*",
    "He gave vent to a horrible smile: \"You will not be believed.--*Paris*",
    "You will only add a scandal to a crime.--*Paris*",
    "Reply quickly!--*Paris*",
    "Will you have me?\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment the wretched archdeacon raised his head mechanically and beheld at the other end of the Place, in the balcony of the Gondelaurier mansion, the captain standing beside Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "He staggered, passed his hand across his eyes, looked again, muttered a curse, and all his features were violently contorted.--*Paris*",
    "This was the dread formula with which it was the custom to conclude these gloomy ceremonies.--*Paris*",
    "It was the signal agreed upon between the priest and the executioner.--*Paris*",
    "The crowd knelt.--*Paris*",
    "He turned his back on the condemned girl, his head sank upon his breast once more, he crossed his hands and rejoined his escort of priests, and a moment later he was seen to disappear, with the cross, the candles, and the copes, beneath the misty arches of the cathedral, and his sonorous voice was extinguished by degrees in the choir, as he chanted this verse of despair,----*Paris*",
    "At the same time, the intermittent clash of the iron butts of the beadles' halberds, gradually dying away among the columns of the nave, produced the effect of a clock hammer striking the last hour of the condemned.--*Paris*",
    "The doors of Notre-Dame remained open, allowing a view of the empty desolate church, draped in mourning, without candles, and without voices.--*Paris*",
    "The condemned girl remained motionless in her place, waiting to be disposed of.--*Paris*",
    "One of the sergeants of police was obliged to notify Master Charmolue of the fact, as the latter, during this entire scene, had been engaged in studying the bas-relief of the grand portal which represents, according to some, the sacrifice of Abraham; according to others, the philosopher's alchemical operation: the sun being figured forth by the angel; the fire, by the fagot; the artisan, by Abraham.--*Paris*",
    "There was considerable difficulty in drawing him away from that contemplation, but at length he turned round; and, at a signal which he gave, two men clad in yellow, the executioner's assistants, approached the gypsy to bind her hands once more.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy creature, at the moment of mounting once again the fatal cart, and proceeding to her last halting-place, was seized, possibly, with some poignant clinging to life.--*Paris*",
    "She raised her dry, red eyes to heaven, to the sun, to the silvery clouds, cut here and there by a blue trapezium or triangle; then she lowered them to objects around her, to the earth, the throng, the houses; all at once, while the yellow man was binding her elbows, she uttered a terrible cry, a cry of joy.--*Paris*",
    "Yonder, on that balcony, at the corner of the Place, she had just caught sight of him, of her friend, her lord, Phoebus, the other apparition of her life!--*Paris*",
    "The judge had lied!--*Paris*",
    "the priest had lied!--*Paris*",
    "it was certainly he, she could not doubt it; he was there, handsome, alive, dressed in his brilliant uniform, his plume on his head, his sword by his side!--*Paris*",
    "And she tried to stretch towards him arms trembling with love and rapture, but they were bound.--*Paris*",
    "Then she saw the captain frown, a beautiful young girl who was leaning against him gazed at him with disdainful lips and irritated eyes; then Phoebus uttered some words which did not reach her, and both disappeared precipitately behind the window opening upon the balcony, which closed after them.--*Paris*",
    "She had borne up until that moment.--*Paris*",
    "But this last blow was too harsh.--*Paris*",
    "She fell lifeless on the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "No one had yet observed in the gallery of the statues of the kings, carved directly above the arches of the portal, a strange spectator, who had, up to that time, observed everything with such impassiveness, with a neck so strained, a visage so hideous that, in his motley accoutrement of red and violet, he might have been taken for one of those stone monsters through whose mouths the long gutters of the cathedral have discharged their waters for six hundred years.--*Paris*",
    "This spectator had missed nothing that had taken place since midday in front of the portal of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "And at the very beginning he had securely fastened to one of the small columns a large knotted rope, one end of which trailed on the flight of steps below.--*Paris*",
    "This being done, he began to look on tranquilly, whistling from time to time when a blackbird flitted past.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly, at the moment when the superintendent's assistants were preparing to execute Charmolue's phlegmatic order, he threw his leg over the balustrade of the gallery, seized the rope with his feet, his knees and his hands; then he was seen to glide down the fa?ade, as a drop of rain slips down a window- pane, rush to the two executioners with the swiftness of a cat which has fallen from a roof, knock them down with two enormous fists, pick up the gypsy with one hand, as a child would her doll, and dash back into the church with a single bound, lifting the young girl above his head and crying in a formidable voice,----*Paris*",
    "This was done with such rapidity, that had it taken place at night, the whole of it could have been seen in the space of a single flash of lightning.--*Paris*",
    "This shock restored the condemned girl to her senses.--*Paris*",
    "She raised her eyelids, looked at Quasimodo, then closed them again suddenly, as though terrified by her deliverer.--*Paris*",
    "Charmolue was stupefied, as well as the executioners and the entire escort.--*Paris*",
    "In fact, within the bounds of Notre-Dame, the condemned girl could not be touched.--*Paris*",
    "The cathedral was a place of refuge.--*Paris*",
    "All temporal jurisdiction expired upon its threshold.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had halted beneath the great portal, his huge feet seemed as solid on the pavement of the church as the heavy Roman pillars.--*Paris*",
    "His great, bushy head sat low between his shoulders, like the heads of lions, who also have a mane and no neck.--*Paris*",
    "He held the young girl, who was quivering all over, suspended from his horny hands like a white drapery; but he carried her with as much care as though he feared to break her or blight her.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that he felt that she was a delicate, exquisite, precious thing, made for other hands than his.--*Paris*",
    "There were moments when he looked as if not daring to touch her, even with his breath.--*Paris*",
    "Then, all at once, he would press her forcibly in his arms, against his angular bosom, like his own possession, his treasure, as the mother of that child would have done.--*Paris*",
    "His gnome's eye, fastened upon her, inundated her with tenderness, sadness, and pity, and was suddenly raised filled with lightnings.--*Paris*",
    "Then the women laughed and wept, the crowd stamped with enthusiasm, for, at that moment Quasimodo had a beauty of his own.--*Paris*",
    "He was handsome; he, that orphan, that foundling, that outcast, he felt himself august and strong, he gazed in the face of that society from which he was banished, and in which he had so powerfully intervened, of that human justice from which he had wrenched its prey, of all those tigers whose jaws were forced to remain empty, of those policemen, those judges, those executioners, of all that force of the king which he, the meanest of creatures, had just broken, with the force of God.--*Paris*",
    "And then, it was touching to behold this protection which had fallen from a being so hideous upon a being so unhappy, a creature condemned to death saved by Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "They were two extremes of natural and social wretchedness, coming into contact and aiding each other.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, after several moments of triumph, Quasimodo had plunged abruptly into the church with his burden.--*Paris*",
    "The populace, fond of all prowess, sought him with their eyes, beneath the gloomy nave, regretting that he had so speedily disappeared from their acclamations.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, he was seen to re-appear at one of the extremities of the gallery of the kings of France; he traversed it, running like a madman, raising his conquest high in his arms and shouting: \"Sanctuary!\"--*Paris*",
    "The crowd broke forth into fresh applause.--*Paris*",
    "The gallery passed, he plunged once more into the interior of the church.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, he re-appeared upon the upper platform, with the gypsy still in his arms, still running madly, still crying, \"Sanctuary!\"--*Paris*",
    "and the throng applauded.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, he made his appearance for the third time upon the summit of the tower where hung the great bell; from that point he seemed to be showing to the entire city the girl whom he had saved, and his voice of thunder, that voice which was so rarely heard, and which he never heard himself, repeated thrice with frenzy, even to the clouds: \"Sanctuary!--*Paris*",
    "Sanctuary!--*Paris*",
    "Sanctuary!\"--*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 1 Delirium--*Paris*",
    "Claude Frollo was no longer in Notre-Dame when his adopted son so abruptly cut the fatal web in which the archdeacon and the gypsy were entangled.--*Paris*",
    "On returning to the sacristy he had torn off his alb, cope, and stole, had flung all into the hands of the stupefied beadle, had made his escape through the private door of the cloister, had ordered a boatman of the Terrain to transport him to the left bank of the Seine, and had plunged into the hilly streets of the University, not knowing whither he was going, encountering at every step groups of men and women who were hurrying joyously towards the Pont Saint-Michel, in the hope of still arriving in time to see the witch hung there,--pale, wild, more troubled, more blind and more fierce than a night bird let loose and pursued by a troop of children in broad daylight.--*Paris*",
    "He no longer knew where he was, what he thought, or whether he were dreaming.--*Paris*",
    "He went forward, walking, running, taking any street at haphazard, making no choice, only urged ever onward away from the Gr\u00e8ve, the horrible Gr\u00e8ve, which he felt confusedly, to be behind him.--*Paris*",
    "In this manner he skirted Mount Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve, and finally emerged from the town by the Porte Saint-Victor.--*Paris*",
    "He continued his flight as long as he could see, when he turned round, the turreted enclosure of the University, and the rare houses of the suburb; but, when, at length, a rise of ground had completely concealed from him that odious Paris, when he could believe himself to be a hundred leagues distant from it, in the fields, in the desert, he halted, and it seemed to him that he breathed more freely.--*Paris*",
    "Then frightful ideas thronged his mind.--*Paris*",
    "Once more he could see clearly into his soul, and he shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "He thought of that unhappy girl who had destroyed him, and whom he had destroyed.--*Paris*",
    "He cast a haggard eye over the double, tortuous way which fate had caused their two destinies to pursue up to their point of intersection, where it had dashed them against each other without mercy.--*Paris*",
    "He meditated on the folly of eternal vows, on the vanity of chastity, of science, of religion, of virtue, on the uselessness of God.--*Paris*",
    "He plunged to his heart's content in evil thoughts, and in proportion as he sank deeper, he felt a Satanic laugh burst forth within him.--*Paris*",
    "And as he thus sifted his soul to the bottom, when he perceived how large a space nature had prepared there for the passions, he sneered still more bitterly.--*Paris*",
    "He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his hatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a physician who examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence was nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man constituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a demon.--*Paris*",
    "Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again, when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, venomous malignant, implacable love, which had ended only in the gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for her, damnation for him.--*Paris*",
    "And then his laughter came again, when he reflected that Phoebus was alive; that after all, the captain lived, was gay and happy, had handsomer doublets than ever, and a new mistress whom he was conducting to see the old one hanged.--*Paris*",
    "His sneer redoubled its bitterness when he reflected that out of the living beings whose death he had desired, the gypsy, the only creature whom he did not hate, was the only one who had not escaped him.--*Paris*",
    "Then from the captain, his thought passed to the people, and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort.--*Paris*",
    "He reflected that the people also, the entire populace, had had before their eyes the woman whom he loved exposed almost naked.--*Paris*",
    "He writhed his arms with agony as he thought that the woman whose form, caught by him alone in the darkness would have been supreme happiness, had been delivered up in broad daylight at full noonday, to a whole people, clad as for a night of voluptuousness.--*Paris*",
    "He wept with rage over all these mysteries of love, profaned, soiled, laid bare, withered forever.--*Paris*",
    "He wept with rage as he pictured to himself how many impure looks had been gratified at the sight of that badly fastened shift, and that this beautiful girl, this virgin lily, this cup of modesty and delight, to which he would have dared to place his lips only trembling, had just been transformed into a sort of public bowl, whereat the vilest populace of Paris, thieves, beggars, lackeys, had come to quaff in common an audacious, impure, and depraved pleasure.--*Paris*",
    "And when he sought to picture to himself the happiness which he might have found upon earth, if she had not been a gypsy, and if he had not been a priest, if Phoebus had not existed and if she had loved him; when he pictured to himself that a life of serenity and love would have been possible to him also, even to him; that there were at that very moment, here and there upon the earth, happy couples spending the hours in sweet converse beneath orange trees, on the banks of brooks, in the presence of a setting sun, of a starry night; and that if God had so willed, he might have formed with her one of those blessed couples,--his heart melted in tenderness and despair.--*Paris*",
    "Oh!--*Paris*",
    "she!--*Paris*",
    "still she!--*Paris*",
    "It was this fixed idea which returned incessantly, which tortured him, which ate into his brain, and rent his vitals.--*Paris*",
    "He did not regret, he did not repent; all that he had done he was ready to do again; he preferred to behold her in the hands of the executioner rather than in the arms of the captain.--*Paris*",
    "But he suffered; he suffered so that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it were not turning white.--*Paris*",
    "Among other moments there came one, when it occurred to him that it was perhaps the very minute when the hideous chain which he had seen that morning, was pressing its iron noose closer about that frail and graceful neck.--*Paris*",
    "This thought caused the perspiration to start from every pore.--*Paris*",
    "There was another moment when, while laughing diabolically at himself, he represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day, lively, careless, joyous, gayly attired, dancing, winged, harmonious, and la Esmeralda of the last day, in her scanty shift, with a rope about her neck, mounting slowly with her bare feet, the angular ladder of the gallows; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner .that he gave vent to a terrible cry.--*Paris*",
    "While this hurricane of despair overturned, broke, tore up, bent, uprooted everything in his soul, he gazed at nature around him.--*Paris*",
    "At his feet, some chickens were searching the thickets and pecking, enamelled beetles ran about in the sun; overhead, some groups of dappled gray clouds were floating across the blue sky; on the horizon, the spire of the Abbey Saint-Victor pierced the ridge of the hill with its slate obelisk; and the miller of the Copeaue hillock was whistling as he watched the laborious wings of his mill turning.--*Paris*",
    "All this active, organized, tranquil life, recurring around him under a thousand forms, hurt him.--*Paris*",
    "He resumed his flight.--*Paris*",
    "He sped thus across the fields until evening.--*Paris*",
    "This flight from nature, life, himself, man, God, everything, lasted all day long.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes he flung himself face downward on the, earth, and tore up the young blades of wheat with his nails.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes he halted in the deserted street of a village, and his thoughts were so intolerable that he grasped his head in both hands and tried to tear it from his shoulders in order to dash it upon the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "Towards the hour of sunset, he examined himself again, and found himself nearly mad.--*Paris*",
    "The tempest which had raged within him ever since the instant when he had lost the hope and the will to save the gypsy,--that tempest had not left in his conscience a single healthy idea, a single thought which maintained its upright position.--*Paris*",
    "His reason lay there almost entirely destroyed.--*Paris*",
    "There remained but two distinct images in his mind, la Esmeralda and the gallows; all the rest was blank.--*Paris*",
    "Those two images united, presented to him a frightful group; and the more he concentrated what attention and thought was left to him, the more he beheld them grow, in accordance with a fantastic progression, the one in grace, in charm, in beauty, in light, the other in deformity and horror; so that at last la Esmeralda appeared to him like a star, the gibbet like an enormous, fleshless arm.--*Paris*",
    "One remarkable fact is, that during the whole of this torture, the idea of dying did not seriously occur to him.--*Paris*",
    "The wretch was made so.--*Paris*",
    "He clung to life.--*Paris*",
    "Perhaps he really saw hell beyond it.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the day continued to decline.--*Paris*",
    "The living being which still existed in him reflected vaguely on retracing its steps.--*Paris*",
    "He believed himself to be far away from Paris; on taking his bearings, he perceived that he had only circled the enclosure of the University.--*Paris*",
    "The spire of Saint-Sulpice, and the three lofty needles of Saint Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s, rose above the horizon on his right.--*Paris*",
    "He turned his steps in that direction.--*Paris*",
    "When he heard the brisk challenge of the men-at-arms of the abbey, around the crenelated, circumscribing wall of Saint-Germain, he turned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and the lazar-house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes found himself on the verge of the Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs.--*Paris*",
    "This meadow was celebrated by reason of the brawls which went on there night and day; it was the hydra of the poor monks of Saint-Germain: ~quod mouachis Sancti-Germaini pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus~.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon was afraid of meeting some one there; he feared every human countenance; he had just avoided the University and the Bourg Saint-Germain; he wished to re-enter the streets as late as possible.--*Paris*",
    "He skirted the Pr\u00e9-aux-Clercs, took the deserted path which separated it from the Dieu-Neuf, and at last reached the water's edge.--*Paris*",
    "There Dom Claude found a boatman, who, for a few farthings in Parisian coinage, rowed him up the Seine as far as the point of the city, and landed him on that tongue of abandoned land where the reader has already beheld Gringoire dreaming, and which was prolonged beyond the king's gardens, parallel to the Ile du Passeur-aux-Vaches.--*Paris*",
    "The monotonous rocking of the boat and the ripple of the water had, in some sort, quieted the unhappy Claude.--*Paris*",
    "When the boatman had taken his departure, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him.--*Paris*",
    "The fatigue of a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind.--*Paris*",
    "The sun had set behind the lofty Tour-de-Nesle.--*Paris*",
    "It was the twilight hour.--*Paris*",
    "The sky was white, the water of the river was white.--*Paris*",
    "Between these two white expanses, the left bank of the Seine, on which his eyes were fixed, projected its gloomy mass and, rendered ever thinner and thinner by perspective, it plunged into the gloom of the horizon like a black spire.--*Paris*",
    "It was loaded with houses, of which only the obscure outline could be distinguished, sharply brought out in shadows against the light background of the sky and the water.--*Paris*",
    "Here and there windows began to gleam, like the holes in a brazier.--*Paris*",
    "That immense black obelisk thus isolated between the two white expanses of the sky and the river, which was very broad at this point, produced upon Dom Claude a singular effect, comparable to that which would be experienced by a man who, reclining on his back at the foot of the tower of Strasburg, should gaze at the enormous spire plunging into the shadows of the twilight above his head.--*Paris*",
    "Only, in this case, it was Claude who was erect and the obelisk which was lying down; but, as the river, reflecting the sky, prolonged the abyss below him, the immense promontory seemed to be as boldly launched into space as any cathedral spire; and the impression was the same.--*Paris*",
    "This impression had even one stronger and more profound point about it, that it was indeed the tower of Strasbourg, but the tower of Strasbourg two leagues in height; something unheard of, gigantic, immeasurable; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen; a tower of Babel.--*Paris*",
    "The chimneys of the houses, the battlements of the walls, the faceted gables of the roofs, the spire of the Augustines, the tower of Nesle, all these projections which broke the profile of the colossal obelisk added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric fashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic sculpture.--*Paris*",
    "Claude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself, believed that he saw, that he saw with his actual eyes, the bell tower of hell; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior furnace; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks, so many death groans.--*Paris*",
    "Then he became alarmed, he put his hands on his ears that he might no longer hear, turned his back that he might no longer see, and fled from the frightful vision with hasty strides.--*Paris*",
    "But the vision was in himself.--*Paris*",
    "When he re-entered the streets, the passers-by elbowing each other by the light of the shop-fronts, produced upon him the effect of a constant going and coming of spectres about him.--*Paris*",
    "There were strange noises in his ears; extraordinary fancies disturbed his brain.--*Paris*",
    "He saw neither houses, nor pavements, nor chariots, nor men and women, but a chaos of indeterminate objects whose edges melted into each other.--*Paris*",
    "At the corner of the Rue de la Barillerie, there was a grocer's shop whose porch was garnished all about, according to immemorial custom, with hoops of tin from which hung a circle of wooden candles, which came in contact with each other in the wind, and rattled like castanets.--*Paris*",
    "He thought he heard a cluster of skeletons at Montfau?on clashing together in the gloom.--*Paris*",
    "In his state of frenzy, he knew not whither he was going.--*Paris*",
    "After a few strides he found himself on the Pont Saint- Michel.--*Paris*",
    "There was a light in the window of a ground-floor room; he approached.--*Paris*",
    "Through a cracked window he beheld a mean chamber which recalled some confused memory to his mind.--*Paris*",
    "In that room, badly lighted by a meagre lamp, there was a fresh, light-haired young man, with a merry face, who amid loud bursts of laughter was embracing a very audaciously attired young girl; and near the lamp sat an old crone spinning and singing in a quavering voice.--*Paris*",
    "As the young man did not laugh constantly, fragments of the old woman's ditty reached the priest; it was something unintelligible yet frightful,----*Paris*",
    "Thereupon the young man laughed and caressed the wench.--*Paris*",
    "The crone was la Falourdel; the girl was a courtesan; the young man was his brother Jehan.--*Paris*",
    "He continued to gaze.--*Paris*",
    "That spectacle was as good as any other.--*Paris*",
    "He saw Jehan go to a window at the end of the room, open it, cast a glance on the quay, where in the distance blazed a thousand lighted casements, and he heard him say as he closed the sash,----*Paris*",
    "Then Jehan came back to the hag, smashed a bottle standing on the table, exclaiming,----*Paris*",
    "This fine pleasantry made the courtesan laugh, and Jehan left the room.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude had barely time to fling himself on the ground in order that he might not be met, stared in the face and recognized by his brother.--*Paris*",
    "Luckily, the street was dark, and the scholar was tipsy.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he caught sight of the archdeacon prone upon the earth in the mud.--*Paris*",
    "He stirred up Dom Claude with his foot, and the latter held his breath.--*Paris*",
    "Then Dom Claude heard him retreat, saying,----*Paris*",
    "Then the archdeacon rose to his feet, and ran without halting, towards Notre-Dame, whose enormous towers he beheld rising above the houses through the gloom.--*Paris*",
    "At the instant when he arrived, panting, on the Place du Parvis, he shrank back and dared not raise his eyes to the fatal edifice.--*Paris*",
    "Still, he ventured to glance at the church.--*Paris*",
    "The front was sombre; the sky behind was glittering with stars.--*Paris*",
    "The crescent of the moon, in her flight upward from the horizon, had paused at the moment, on the summit of the light hand tower, and seemed to have perched itself, like a luminous bird, on the edge of the balustrade, cut out in black trefoils.--*Paris*",
    "The cloister door was shut; but the archdeacon always carried with him the key of the tower in which his laboratory was situated.--*Paris*",
    "He made use of it to enter the church.--*Paris*",
    "In the church he found the gloom and silence of a cavern.--*Paris*",
    "By the deep shadows which fell in broad sheets from all directions, he recognized the fact that the hangings for the ceremony of the morning had not yet been removed.--*Paris*",
    "The great silver cross shone from the depths of the gloom, powdered with some sparkling points, like the milky way of that sepulchral night.--*Paris*",
    "The long windows of the choir showed the upper extremities of their arches above the black draperies, and their painted panes, traversed by a ray of moonlight had no longer any hues but the doubtful colors of night, a sort of violet, white and blue, whose tint is found only on the faces of the dead.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon, on perceiving these wan spots all around the choir, thought he beheld the mitres of damned bishops.--*Paris*",
    "He shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, he thought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him.--*Paris*",
    "He started to flee across the church.--*Paris*",
    "Then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it was alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw, which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula, and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet, its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings.--*Paris*",
    "This fever or madness had reached such a degree of intensity that the external world was no longer anything more for the unhappy man than a sort of Apocalypse,- visible, palpable, terrible.--*Paris*",
    "For one moment, he was relieved.--*Paris*",
    "As he plunged into the side aisles, he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars.--*Paris*",
    "He ran towards it as to a star.--*Paris*",
    "It was the poor lamp which lighted the public breviary of Notre-Dame night and day, beneath its iron grating.--*Paris*",
    "He flung himself eagerly upon the holy book in the hope of finding some consolation, or some encouragement there.--*Paris*",
    "The hook lay open at this passage of Job, over which his staring eye glanced,----*Paris*",
    "On reading these gloomy words, he felt that which a blind man feels when he feels himself pricked by the staff which he has picked up.--*Paris*",
    "His knees gave way beneath him, and he sank upon the pavement, thinking of her who had died that day.--*Paris*",
    "He felt so many monstrous vapors pass and discharge themselves in his brain, that it seemed to him that his head had become one of the chimneys of hell.--*Paris*",
    "It would appear that he remained a long time in this attitude, no longer thinking, overwhelmed and passive beneath the hand of the demon.--*Paris*",
    "At length some strength returned to him; it occurred to him to take refuge in his tower beside his faithful Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He rose; and, as he was afraid, he took the lamp from the breviary to light his way.--*Paris*",
    "It was a sacrilege; but he had got beyond heeding such a trifle now.--*Paris*",
    "He slowly climbed the stairs of the towers, filled with a secret fright which must have been communicated to the rare passers-by in the Place du Parvis by the mysterious light of his lamp, mounting so late from loophole to loophole of the bell tower.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, he felt a freshness on his face, and found himself at the door of the highest gallery.--*Paris*",
    "The air was cold; the sky was filled with hurrying clouds, whose large, white flakes drifted one upon another like the breaking up of river ice after the winter.--*Paris*",
    "The crescent of the moon, stranded in the midst of the clouds, seemed a celestial vessel caught in the ice-cakes of the air.--*Paris*",
    "He lowered his gaze, and contemplated for a moment, through the railing of slender columns which unites the two towers, far away, through a gauze of mists and smoke, the silent throng of the roofs of Paris, pointed, innumerable, crowded and small like the waves of a tranquil sea on a sum- mer night.--*Paris*",
    "The moon cast a feeble ray, which imparted to earth and heaven an ashy hue.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment the clock raised its shrill, cracked voice.--*Paris*",
    "Midnight rang out.--*Paris*",
    "The priest thought of midday; twelve o'clock had come back again.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, a gust of wind extinguished his lamp, and almost at the same instant, he beheld a shade, a whiteness, a form, a woman, appear from the opposite angle of the tower.--*Paris*",
    "He started.--*Paris*",
    "Beside this woman was a little goat, which mingled its bleat with the last bleat of the clock.--*Paris*",
    "He had strength enough to look.--*Paris*",
    "It was she.--*Paris*",
    "She was pale, she was gloomy.--*Paris*",
    "Her hair fell over her shoulders as in the morning; but there was no longer a rope on her neck, her hands were no longer bound; she was free, she was dead.--*Paris*",
    "She was dressed in white and had a white veil on her head.--*Paris*",
    "She came towards him, slowly, with her gaze fixed on the sky.--*Paris*",
    "The supernatural goat followed her.--*Paris*",
    "He felt as though made of stone and too heavy to flee.--*Paris*",
    "At every step which she took in advance, he took one backwards, and that was all.--*Paris*",
    "In this way he retreated once more beneath the gloomy arch of the stairway.--*Paris*",
    "He was chilled by the thought that she might enter there also; had she done so, he would have died of terror.--*Paris*",
    "She did arrive, in fact, in front of the door to the stairway, and paused there for several minutes, stared intently into the darkness, but without appearing to see the priest, and passed on.--*Paris*",
    "She seemed taller to him than when she had been alive; he saw the moon through her white robe; he heard her breath.--*Paris*",
    "When she had passed on, he began to descend the staircase again, with the slowness which he had observed in the spectre, believing himself to be a spectre too, haggard, with hair on end, his extinguished lamp still in his hand; and as he descended the spiral steps, he distinctly heard in his ear a voice laughing and repeating,----*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 2 Hunchbacked, One Eyed, Lame--*Paris*",
    "Every city during the Middle Ages, and every city in France down to the time of Louis XII.--*Paris*",
    "had its places of asylum.--*Paris*",
    "These sanctuaries, in the midst of the deluge of penal and barbarous jurisdictions which inundated the city, were a species of islands which rose above the level of human justice.--*Paris*",
    "Every criminal who landed there was safe.--*Paris*",
    "There were in every suburb almost as many places of asylum as gallows.--*Paris*",
    "It was the abuse of impunity by the side of the abuse of punishment; two bad things which strove to correct each other.--*Paris*",
    "The palaces of the king, the hotels of the princes, and especially churches, possessed the right of asylum.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes a whole city which stood in need of being repeopled was temporarily created a place of refuge.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "made all Paris a refuge in 1467.--*Paris*",
    "His foot once within the asylum, the criminal was sacred; but he must beware of leaving it; one step outside the sanctuary, and he fell back into the flood.--*Paris*",
    "The wheel, the gibbet, the strappado, kept good guard around the place of refuge, and lay in watch incessantly for their prey, like sharks around a vessel.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, condemned men were to be seen whose hair had grown white in a cloister, on the steps of a palace, in the enclosure of an abbey, beneath the porch of a church; in this manner the asylum was a prison as much as any other.--*Paris*",
    "It sometimes happened that a solemn decree of parliament violated the asylum and restored the condemned man to the executioner; but this was of rare occurrence.--*Paris*",
    "Parliaments were afraid of the bishops, and when there was friction between these two robes, the gown had but a poor chance against the cassock.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes, however, as in the affair of the assassins of Petit-Jean, the headsman of Paris, and in that of Emery Rousseau, the murderer of Jean Valleret, justice overleaped the church and passed on to the execution of its sentences; but unless by virtue of a decree of Parliament, woe to him who violated a place of asylum with armed force!--*Paris*",
    "The reader knows the manner of death of Robert de Clermont, Marshal of France, and of Jean de Chalons, Marshal of Champagne; and yet the question was only of a certain Perrin Marc, the clerk of a money-changer, a miserable assassin; but the two marshals had broken the doors of St. M\u00e9ry.--*Paris*",
    "Therein lay the enormity.--*Paris*",
    "Such respect was cherished for places of refuge that, according to tradition, animals even felt it at times.--*Paris*",
    "Aymoire relates that a stag, being chased by Dagobert, having taken refuge near the tomb of Saint-Denis, the pack of hounds stopped short and barked.--*Paris*",
    "Churches generally had a small apartment prepared for the reception of supplicants.--*Paris*",
    "In 1407, Nicolas Flamel caused to be built on the vaults of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, a chamber which cost him four livres six sous, sixteen farthings, parisis.--*Paris*",
    "At Notre-Dame it was a tiny cell situated on the roof of the side aisle, beneath the flying buttresses, precisely at the spot where the wife of the present janitor of the towers has made for herself a garden, which is to the hanging gardens of Babylon what a lettuce is to a palm-tree, what a porter's wife is to a Semiramis.--*Paris*",
    "It was here that Quasimodo had deposited la Esmeralda, after his wild and triumphant course.--*Paris*",
    "As long as that course lasted, the young girl had been unable to recover her senses, half unconscious, half awake, no longer feeling anything, except that she was mounting through the air, floating in it, flying in it, that something was raising her above the earth.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time she heard the loud laughter, the noisy voice of Quasimodo in her ear; she half opened her eyes; then below her she confusedly beheld Paris checkered with its thousand roofs of slate and tiles, like a red and blue mosaic, above her head the frightful and joyous face of Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "Then her eyelids drooped again; she thought that all was over, that they had executed her during her swoon, and that the misshapen spirit which had presided over her destiny, had laid hold of her and was bearing her away.--*Paris*",
    "She dared not look at him, and she surrendered herself to her fate.--*Paris*",
    "But when the bellringer, dishevelled and panting, had deposited her in the cell of refuge, when she felt his huge hands gently detaching the cord which bruised her arms, she felt that sort of shock which awakens with a start the passengers of a vessel which runs aground in the middle of a dark night.--*Paris*",
    "Her thoughts awoke also, and returned to her one by one.--*Paris*",
    "She saw that she was in Notre-Dame; she remembered having been torn from the hands of the executioner; that Phoebus was alive, that Phoebus loved her no longer; and as these two ideas, one of which shed so much bitterness over the other, presented themselves simultaneously to the poor condemned girl; she turned to Quasimodo, who was standing in front of her, and who terrified her; she said to him,--\"Why have you saved me?\"--*Paris*",
    "He gazed at her with anxiety, as though seeking to divine what she was saying to him.--*Paris*",
    "She repeated her question.--*Paris*",
    "Then he gave her a profoundly sorrowful glance and fled.--*Paris*",
    "She was astonished.--*Paris*",
    "A few moments later he returned, bearing a package which he cast at her feet.--*Paris*",
    "It was clothing which some charitable women had left on the threshold of the church for her.--*Paris*",
    "Then she dropped her eyes upon herself and saw that she was almost naked, and blushed.--*Paris*",
    "Life had returned.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo appeared to experience something of this modesty.--*Paris*",
    "He covered his eyes with his large hand and retired once more, but slowly.--*Paris*",
    "She made haste to dress herself.--*Paris*",
    "The robe was a white one with a white veil,--the garb of a novice of the H?tel-Dien.--*Paris*",
    "She had barely finished when she beheld Quasimodo returning.--*Paris*",
    "He carried a basket under one arm and a mattress under the other.--*Paris*",
    "In the basket there was a bottle, bread, and some provisions.--*Paris*",
    "He set the basket on the floor and said, \"Eat!\"--*Paris*",
    "He spread the mattress on the flagging and said, \"Sleep.\"--*Paris*",
    "It was his own repast, it was his own bed, which the bellringer had gone in search of.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy raised her eyes to thank him, but she could not articulate a word.--*Paris*",
    "She dropped her head with a quiver of terror.--*Paris*",
    "Then he said to her.--*Paris*",
    "She was touched and raised her head to answer him.--*Paris*",
    "He had disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "She found herself alone once more, meditating upon the singular words of this almost monstrous being, and struck by the sound of his voice, which was so hoarse yet so gentle.--*Paris*",
    "Then she examined her cell.--*Paris*",
    "It was a chamber about six feet square, with a small window and a door on the slightly sloping plane of the roof formed of flat stones.--*Paris*",
    "Many gutters with the figures of animals seemed to be bending down around her, and stretching their necks in order to stare at her through the window.--*Paris*",
    "Over the edge of her roof she perceived the tops of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the fires in Paris to rise beneath her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "A sad sight for the poor gypsy, a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country, without family, without a hearthstone.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her more poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between her hands, upon her knees.--*Paris*",
    "She started (everything alarmed her now) and looked.--*Paris*",
    "It was the poor goat, the agile Djali, which had made its escape after her, at the moment when Quasimodo had put to flight Charmolue's brigade, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly an hour past, without being able to win a glance.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy covered him with kisses.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, as though an invisible hand had lifted the weight which had repressed her tears in her heart for so long, she began to weep, and, in proportion as her tears flowed, she felt all that was most acrid and bitter in her grief depart with them.--*Paris*",
    "Evening came, she thought the night so beautiful that she made the circuit of the elevated gallery which surrounds the church.--*Paris*",
    "It afforded her some relief, so calm did the earth appear when viewed from that height.--*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 3 Deaf--*Paris*",
    "On the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had been asleep.--*Paris*",
    "This singular thing astonished her.--*Paris*",
    "She had been so long unaccustomed to sleep!--*Paris*",
    "A joyous ray of the rising sun entered through her window and touched her face.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time with the sun, she beheld at that window an object which frightened her, the unfortunate face of Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "She involuntarily closed her eyes again, but in vain; she fancied that she still saw through the rosy lids that gnome's mask, one-eyed and gap-toothed.--*Paris*",
    "Then, while she still kept her eyes closed, she heard a rough voice saying, very gently,----*Paris*",
    "There was something more plaintive than these words, and that was the accent in which they were uttered.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy, much touched, opened her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "He was, in fact, no longer at the window.--*Paris*",
    "She approached the opening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the wall, in a sad and resigned attitude.--*Paris*",
    "She made an effort to surmount the repugnance with which he inspired her.--*Paris*",
    "Then she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her goat asleep at her feet.--*Paris*",
    "Both remained motionless for several moments, considering in silence, she so much grace, he so much ugliness.--*Paris*",
    "Every moment she discovered some fresh deformity in Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "Her glance travelled from his knock knees to his humped back, from his humped back to his only eye.--*Paris*",
    "She could not comprehend the existence of a being so awkwardly fashioned.--*Paris*",
    "Yet there was so much sadness and so much gentleness spread over all this, that she began to become reconciled to it.--*Paris*",
    "He was the first to break the silence.--*Paris*",
    "She made an affirmative sign of the head, and said, \"Yes.\"--*Paris*",
    "He understood the motion of the head.--*Paris*",
    "He began to smile sadly.--*Paris*",
    "There lay in the accents of the wretched man so profound a consciousness of his misery, that she had not the strength to say a word.--*Paris*",
    "Besides, he would not have heard her.--*Paris*",
    "He went on,----*Paris*",
    "Then he began to laugh, and that laugh was the most heartbreaking thing in the world.--*Paris*",
    "He continued,----*Paris*",
    "He watched her attentively while she was speaking.--*Paris*",
    "She listened to him with profound tenderness.--*Paris*",
    "A tear swam in the eye of the bellringer, but did not fall.--*Paris*",
    "He seemed to make it a sort of point of honor to retain it.--*Paris*",
    "Then he rose.--*Paris*",
    "Unhappy as was the Bohemian, this eccentric being still aroused some compassion in her.--*Paris*",
    "She made him a sign to remain.--*Paris*",
    "He drew from his pocket a little metal whistle.--*Paris*",
    "He laid the whistle on the floor and fled.--*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 4 Earthenware And Crystal--*Paris*",
    "Day followed day.--*Paris*",
    "Calm gradually returned to the soul of la Esmeralda.--*Paris*",
    "Excess of grief, like excess of joy is a violent thing which lasts but a short time.--*Paris*",
    "The heart of man cannot remain long in one extremity.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy had suffered so much, that nothing was left her but astonishment.--*Paris*",
    "With security, hope had returned to her.--*Paris*",
    "She was outside the pale of society, outside the pale of life, but she had a vague feeling that it might not be impossible to return to it.--*Paris*",
    "She was like a dead person, who should hold in reserve the key to her tomb.--*Paris*",
    "She felt the terrible images which had so long persecuted her, gradually departing.--*Paris*",
    "All the hideous phantoms, Pierrat Torterue, Jacques Charmolue, were effaced from her mind, all, even the priest.--*Paris*",
    "And then, Phoebus was alive; she was sure of it, she had seen him.--*Paris*",
    "To her the fact of Phoebus being alive was everything.--*Paris*",
    "After the series of fatal shocks which had overturned everything within her, she had found but one thing intact in her soul, one sentiment,--her love for the captain.--*Paris*",
    "Love is like a tree; it sprouts forth of itself, sends its roots out deeply through our whole being, and often continues to flourish greenly over a heart in ruins.--*Paris*",
    "And the inexplicable point about it is that the more blind is this passion, the more tenacious it is.--*Paris*",
    "It is never more solid than when it has no reason in it.--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda did not think of the captain without bitterness, no doubt.--*Paris*",
    "No doubt it was terrible that he also should have been deceived; that he should have believed that impossible thing, that he could have conceived of a stab dealt by her who would have given a thousand lives for him.--*Paris*",
    "But, after all, she must not be too angry with him for it; had she not confessed her crime?--*Paris*",
    "had she not yielded, weak woman that she was, to torture?--*Paris*",
    "The fault was entirely hers.--*Paris*",
    "She should have allowed her finger nails to be torn out rather than such a word to be wrenched from her.--*Paris*",
    "In short, if she could but see Phoebus once more, for a single minute, only one word would be required, one look, in order to undeceive him, to bring him back.--*Paris*",
    "She did not doubt it.--*Paris*",
    "She was astonished also at many singular things, at the accident of Phoebus's presence on the day of the penance, at the young girl with whom he had been.--*Paris*",
    "She was his sister, no doubt.--*Paris*",
    "An unreasonable explanation, but she contented herself with it, because she needed to believe that Phoebus still loved her, and loved her alone.--*Paris*",
    "Had he not sworn it to her?--*Paris*",
    "What more was needed, simple and credulous as she was?--*Paris*",
    "And then, in this matter, were not appearances much more against her than against him?--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly, she waited.--*Paris*",
    "She hoped.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that the church, that vast church, which surrounded her on every side, which guarded her, which saved her, was itself a sovereign tranquillizer.--*Paris*",
    "The solemn lines of that architecture, the religious attitude of all the objects which surrounded the young girl, the serene and pious thoughts which emanated, so to speak, from all the pores of that stone, acted upon her without her being aware of it.--*Paris*",
    "The edifice had also sounds fraught with such benediction and such majesty, that they soothed this ailing soul.--*Paris*",
    "The monotonous chanting of the celebrants, the responses of the people to the priest, sometimes inarticulate, sometimes thunderous, the harmonious trembling of the painted windows, the organ, bursting forth like a hundred trumpets, the three belfries, humming like hives of huge bees, that whole orchestra on which bounded a gigantic scale, ascending, descending incessantly from the voice of a throng to that of one bell, dulled her memory, her imagination, her grief.--*Paris*",
    "The bells, in particular, lulled her.--*Paris*",
    "It was something like a powerful magnetism which those vast instruments shed over her in great waves.--*Paris*",
    "Thus every sunrise found her more calm, breathing better, less pale.--*Paris*",
    "In proportion as her inward wounds closed, her grace and beauty blossomed once more on her countenance, but more thoughtful, more reposeful.--*Paris*",
    "Her former character also returned to her, somewhat even of her gayety, her pretty pout, her love for her goat, her love for singing, her modesty.--*Paris*",
    "She took care to dress herself in the morning in the corner of her cell for fear some inhabitants of the neighboring attics might see her through the window.--*Paris*",
    "When the thought of Phoebus left her time, the gypsy sometimes thought of Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He was the sole bond, the sole connection, the sole communication which remained to her with men, with the living.--*Paris*",
    "Unfortunate girl!--*Paris*",
    "she was more outside the world than Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "She understood not in the least the strange friend whom chance had given her.--*Paris*",
    "She often reproached herself for not feeling a gratitude which should close her eyes, but decidedly, she could not accustom herself to the poor bellringer.--*Paris*",
    "He was too ugly.--*Paris*",
    "She had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground.--*Paris*",
    "This did not prevent Quasimodo from making his appearance from time to time during the first few days.--*Paris*",
    "She did her best not to turn aside with too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions or her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.--*Paris*",
    "Once he came at the moment when she was caressing Djali.--*Paris*",
    "He stood pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and the gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,----*Paris*",
    "She gazed at him in amazement.--*Paris*",
    "He replied to the glance,----*Paris*",
    "On another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which he never entered) at the moment when la Esmeralda was singing an old Spanish ballad, the words of which she did not understand, but which had lingered in her ear because the gypsy women had lulled her to sleep with it when she was a little child.--*Paris*",
    "At the sight of that villanous form which made its appearance so abruptly in the middle of her song, the young girl paused with an involuntary gesture of alarm.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy bellringer fell upon his knees on the threshold, and clasped his large, misshapen hands with a suppliant air.--*Paris*",
    "On another occasion, he came to her with an awkward and timid air.--*Paris*",
    "At last, one morning, la Esmeralda had advanced to the edge of the roof, and was looking into the Place over the pointed roof of Saint-Jean le Rond.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was standing behind her.--*Paris*",
    "He had placed himself in that position in order to spare the young girl, as far as possible, the displeasure of seeing him.--*Paris*",
    "All at once the gypsy started, a tear and a flash of joy gleamed simultaneously in her eyes, she knelt on the brink of the roof and extended her arms towards the Place with anguish, exclaiming: \"Phoebus!--*Paris*",
    "come!--*Paris*",
    "come!--*Paris*",
    "a word, a single word in the name of heaven!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!\"--*Paris*",
    "Her voice, her face, her gesture, her whole person bore the heartrending expression of a shipwrecked man who is making a signal of distress to the joyous vessel which is passing afar off in a ray of sunlight on the horizon.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo leaned over the Place, and saw that the object of this tender and agonizing prayer was a young man, a captain, a handsome cavalier all glittering with arms and decorations, prancing across the end of the Place, and saluting with his plume a beautiful lady who was smiling at him from her balcony.--*Paris*",
    "However, the officer did not hear the unhappy girl calling him; he was too far away.--*Paris*",
    "But the poor deaf man heard.--*Paris*",
    "A profound sigh heaved his breast; he turned round; his heart was swollen with all the tears which he was swallowing; his convulsively-clenched fists struck against his head, and when he withdrew them there was a bunch of red hair in each hand.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy paid no heed to him.--*Paris*",
    "He said in a low voice as he gnashed his teeth,----*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, she remained kneeling, and cried with extraor- dinary agitation,-- \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "there he is alighting from his horse!--*Paris*",
    "He is about to enter that house!--Phoebus!--He does not hear me!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!--How wicked that woman is to speak to him at the same time with me!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!\"--*Paris*",
    "The deaf man gazed at her.--*Paris*",
    "He understood this pantomime.--*Paris*",
    "The poor bellringer's eye filled with tears, but he let none fall.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he pulled her gently by the border of her sleeve.--*Paris*",
    "She turned round.--*Paris*",
    "He had assumed a tranquil air; he said to her,----*Paris*",
    "She uttered a cry of joy.--*Paris*",
    "She clasped his knees.--*Paris*",
    "He could not refrain from shaking his head sadly.--*Paris*",
    "When he reached the Place, he no longer saw anything except the handsome horse hitched at the door of the Gondelaurier house; the captain had just entered there.--*Paris*",
    "He raised his eyes to the roof of the church.--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda was there in the same spot, in the same attitude.--*Paris*",
    "He made her a sad sign with his head; then he planted his back against one of the stone posts of the Gondelaurier porch, determined to wait until the captain should come forth.--*Paris*",
    "In the Gondelaurier house it was one of those gala days which precede a wedding.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo beheld many people enter, but no one come out.--*Paris*",
    "He cast a glance towards the roof from time to time; the gypsy did not stir any more than himself.--*Paris*",
    "A groom came and unhitched the horse and led it to the stable of the house.--*Paris*",
    "The entire day passed thus, Quasimodo at his post, la Esmeralda on the roof, Phoebus, no doubt, at the feet of Fleur-de-Lys.--*Paris*",
    "At length night came, a moonless night, a dark night.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo fixed his gaze in vain upon la Esmeralda; soon she was no more than a whiteness amid the twilight; then nothing.--*Paris*",
    "All was effaced, all was black.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo beheld the front windows from top to bottom of the Gondelaurier mansion illuminated; he saw the other casements in the Place lighted one by one, he also saw them extinguished to the very last, for he remained the whole evening at his post.--*Paris*",
    "The officer did not come forth.--*Paris*",
    "When the last passers-by had returned home, when the windows of all the other houses were extinguished, Quasimodo was left entirely alone, entirely in the dark.--*Paris*",
    "There were at that time no lamps in the square before Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the windows of the Gondelaurier mansion remained lighted, even after midnight.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, motionless and attentive, beheld a throng of lively, dancing shadows pass athwart the many-colored painted panes.--*Paris*",
    "Had he not been deaf, he would have heard more and more distinctly, in proportion as the noise of sleeping Paris died away, a sound of feasting, laughter, and music in the Gondelaurier mansion.--*Paris*",
    "Towards one o'clock in the morning, the guests began to take their leave.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, shrouded in darkness watched them all pass out through the porch illuminated with torches.--*Paris*",
    "None of them was the captain.--*Paris*",
    "He was filled with sad thoughts; at times he looked upwards into the air, like a person who is weary of waiting.--*Paris*",
    "Great black clouds, heavy, torn, split, hung like crape hammocks beneath the starry dome of night.--*Paris*",
    "One would have pronounced them spiders' webs of the vault of heaven.--*Paris*",
    "In one of these moments he suddenly beheld the long window on the balcony, whose stone balustrade projected above his head, open mysteriously.--*Paris*",
    "The frail glass door gave passage to two persons, and closed noiselessly behind them; it was a man and a woman.--*Paris*",
    "It was not without difficulty that Quasimodo succeeded in recognizing in the man the handsome captain, in the woman the young lady whom he had seen welcome the officer in the morning from that very balcony.--*Paris*",
    "The place was perfectly dark, and a double crimson curtain which had fallen across the door the very moment it closed again, allowed no light to reach the balcony from the apartment.--*Paris*",
    "The young man and the young girl, so far as our deaf man could judge, without hearing a single one of their words, appeared to abandon themselves to a very tender t\u00eate-a-t\u00eate.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl seemed to have allowed the officer to make a girdle for her of his arm, and gently repulsed a kiss.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo looked on from below at this scene which was all the more pleasing to witness because it was not meant to be seen.--*Paris*",
    "He contemplated with bitterness that beauty, that happiness.--*Paris*",
    "After all, nature was not dumb in the poor fellow, and his human sensibility, all maliciously contorted as it was, quivered no less than any other.--*Paris*",
    "He thought of the miserable portion which Providence had allotted to him; that woman and the pleasure of love, would pass forever before his eyes, and that he should never do anything but behold the felicity of others.--*Paris*",
    "But that which rent his heart most in this sight, that which mingled indignation with his anger, was the thought of what the gypsy would suffer could she behold it.--*Paris*",
    "It is true that the night was very dark, that la Esmeralda, if she had remained at her post (and he had no doubt of this), was very far away, and that it was all that he himself could do to distinguish the lovers on the balcony.--*Paris*",
    "This consoled him.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, their conversation grew more and more animated.--*Paris*",
    "The young lady appeared to be entreating the officer to ask nothing more of her.--*Paris*",
    "Of all this Quasimodo could distinguish only the beautiful clasped hands, the smiles mingled with tears, the young girl's glances directed to the stars, the eyes of the captain lowered ardently upon her.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately, for the young girl was beginning to resist but feebly, the door of the balcony suddenly opened once more and an old dame appeared; the beauty seemed confused, the officer assumed an air of displeasure, and all three withdrew.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later, a horse was champing his bit under the porch, and the brilliant officer, enveloped in his night cloak, passed rapidly before Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "The bellringer allowed him to turn the corner of the street, then he ran after him with his ape-like agility, shouting: \"Hey there!--*Paris*",
    "captain!\"--*Paris*",
    "The captain halted.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Quasimodo had caught up with him, and had boldly grasped his horse's bridle: \"Follow me, captain; there is one here who desires to speak with you!--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, far from releasing the bridle, prepared to force him to retrace his steps.--*Paris*",
    "Unable to comprehend the captain's resistance, he hastened to say to him,----*Paris*",
    "This word did, indeed, produce a great effect on Phoebus, but not of the kind which the deaf man expected.--*Paris*",
    "It will be remembered that our gallant officer had retired with Fleur- de-Lys several moments before Quasimodo had rescued the condemned girl from the hands of Charmolue.--*Paris*",
    "Afterwards, in all his visits to the Gondelaurier mansion he had taken care not to mention that woman, the memory of whom was, after all, painful to him; and on her side, Fleur-de-Lys had not deemed it politic to tell him that the gypsy was alive.--*Paris*",
    "Hence Phoebus believed poor \"Similar\" to be dead, and that a month or two had elapsed since her death.--*Paris*",
    "Let us add that for the last few moments the captain had been reflecting on the profound darkness of the night, the supernatural ugliness, the sepulchral voice of the strange messenger; that it was past midnight; that the street was deserted, as on the evening when the surly monk had accosted him; and that his horse snorted as it looked at Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "And he laid his hand on the hilt of his dagger.--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus dealt him a vigorous kick in the breast.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo's eye flashed.--*Paris*",
    "He made a motion to fling himself on the captain.--*Paris*",
    "Then he drew himself up stiffly and said,----*Paris*",
    "He emphasized the words \"some one,\" and loosing the horse's bridle,----*Paris*",
    "Phoebus spurred on in all haste, swearing.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo watched him disappear in the shades of the street.--*Paris*",
    "He re-entered Notre-Dame, lighted his lamp and climbed to the tower again.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy was still in the same place, as he had supposed.--*Paris*",
    "She flew to meet him as far off as she could see him.--*Paris*",
    "He saw her gesture of wrath, and understood the reproach.--*Paris*",
    "He left her.--*Paris*",
    "She was displeased with him.--*Paris*",
    "He preferred to have her abuse him rather than to have afflicted her.--*Paris*",
    "He had kept all the pain to himself.--*Paris*",
    "From that day forth, the gypsy no longer saw him.--*Paris*",
    "He ceased to come to her cell.--*Paris*",
    "At the most she occasionally caught a glimpse at the summit of the towers, of the bellringer's face turned sadly to her.--*Paris*",
    "But as soon as she perceived him, he disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "We must admit that she was not much grieved by this voluntary absence on the part of the poor hunchback.--*Paris*",
    "At the bottom of her heart she was grateful to him for it.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, Quasimodo did not deceive himself on this point.--*Paris*",
    "She no longer saw him, but she felt the presence of a good genius about her.--*Paris*",
    "Her provisions were replenished by an invisible hand during her slumbers.--*Paris*",
    "One morning she found a cage of birds on her window.--*Paris*",
    "There was a piece of sculpture above her window which frightened her.--*Paris*",
    "She had shown this more than once in Quasimodo's presence.--*Paris*",
    "One morning, for all these things happened at night, she no longer saw it, it had been broken.--*Paris*",
    "The person who had climbed up to that carving must have risked his life.--*Paris*",
    "Sometimes, in the evening, she heard a voice, concealed beneath the wind screen of the bell tower, singing a sad, strange song, as though to lull her to sleep.--*Paris*",
    "The lines were unrhymed, such as a deaf person can make.--*Paris*",
    "One morning, on awaking, she saw on her window two vases filled with flowers.--*Paris*",
    "One was a very beautiful and very brilliant but cracked vase of glass.--*Paris*",
    "It had allowed the water with which it had been filled to escape, and the flowers which it contained were withered.--*Paris*",
    "The other was an earthenware pot, coarse and common, but which had preserved all its water, and its flowers remained fresh and crimson.--*Paris*",
    "I know not whether it was done intentionally, but La Esmeralda took the faded nosegay and wore it all day long upon her breast.--*Paris*",
    "That day she did not hear the voice singing in the tower.--*Paris*",
    "She troubled herself very little about it.--*Paris*",
    "She passed her days in caressing Djali, in watching the door of the Gondelaurier house, in talking to herself about Phoebus, and in crumbling up her bread for the swallows.--*Paris*",
    "She had entirely ceased to see or hear Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "The poor bellringer seemed to have disappeared from the church.--*Paris*",
    "One night, nevertheless, when she was not asleep, but was thinking of her handsome captain, she heard something breathing near her cell.--*Paris*",
    "She rose in alarm, and saw by the light of the moon, a shapeless mass lying across her door on the outside.--*Paris*",
    "It was Quasimodo asleep there upon the stones.--*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 5 The Key To The Red Door--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, public minor had informed the archdeacon of the miraculous manner in which the gypsy had been saved.--*Paris*",
    "When he learned it, he knew not what his sensations were.--*Paris*",
    "He had reconciled himself to la Esmeralda's death.--*Paris*",
    "In that matter he was tranquil; he had reached the bottom of personal suffering.--*Paris*",
    "The human heart (Dora Claude had meditated upon these matters) can contain only a certain quantity of despair.--*Paris*",
    "When the sponge is saturated, the sea may pass over it without causing a single drop more to enter it.--*Paris*",
    "Now, with la Esmeralda dead, the sponge was soaked, all was at an end on this earth for Dom Claude.--*Paris*",
    "But to feel that she was alive, and Phoebus also, meant that tortures, shocks, alternatives, life, were beginning again.--*Paris*",
    "And Claude was weary of all this.--*Paris*",
    "When he heard this news, he shut himself in his cell in the cloister.--*Paris*",
    "He appeared neither at the meetings of the chapter nor at the services.--*Paris*",
    "He closed his door against all, even against the bishop.--*Paris*",
    "He remained thus immured for several weeks.--*Paris*",
    "He was believed to be ill. And so he was, in fact.--*Paris*",
    "What did he do while thus shut up?--*Paris*",
    "With what thoughts was the unfortunate man contending?--*Paris*",
    "Was he giving final battle to his formidable passion?--*Paris*",
    "Was he concocting a final plan of death for her and of perdition for himself?--*Paris*",
    "His Jehan, his cherished brother, his spoiled child, came once to his door, knocked, swore, entreated, gave his name half a score of times.--*Paris*",
    "Claude did not open.--*Paris*",
    "He passed whole days with his face close to the panes of his window.--*Paris*",
    "From that window, situated in the cloister, he could see la Esmeralda's chamber.--*Paris*",
    "He often saw herself with her goat, sometimes with Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He remarked the little attentions of the ugly deaf man, his obedience, his delicate and submissive ways with the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "He recalled, for he had a good memory, and memory is the tormentor of the jealous, he recalled the singular look of the bellringer, bent on the dancer upon a certain evening.--*Paris*",
    "He asked himself what motive could have impelled Quasimodo to save her.--*Paris*",
    "He was the witness of a thousand little scenes between the gypsy and the deaf man, the pantomime of which, viewed from afar and commented on by his passion, appeared very tender to him.--*Paris*",
    "He distrusted the capriciousness of women.--*Paris*",
    "Then he felt a jealousy which be could never have believed possible awakening within him, a jealousy which made him redden with shame and indignation: \"One might condone the captain, but this one!\"--*Paris*",
    "This thought upset him.--*Paris*",
    "His nights were frightful.--*Paris*",
    "As soon as he learned that the gypsy was alive, the cold ideas of spectre and tomb which had persecuted him for a whole day vanished, and the flesh returned to goad him.--*Paris*",
    "He turned and twisted on his couch at the thought that the dark-skinned maiden was so near him.--*Paris*",
    "Every night his delirious imagination represented la Esmeralda to him in all the attitudes which had caused his blood to boil most.--*Paris*",
    "He beheld her outstretched upon the poniarded captain, her eyes closed, her beautiful bare throat covered with Phoebus's blood, at that moment of bliss when the archdeacon had imprinted on her pale lips that kiss whose burn the unhappy girl, though half dead, had felt.--*Paris*",
    "He beheld her, again, stripped by the savage hands of the torturers, allowing them to bare and to enclose in the boot with its iron screw, her tiny foot, her delicate rounded leg, her white and supple knee.--*Paris*",
    "Again he beheld that ivory knee which alone remained outside of Torterue's horrible apparatus.--*Paris*",
    "Lastly, he pictured the young girl in her shift, with the rope about her neck, shoulders bare, feet bare, almost nude, as he had seen her on that last day.--*Paris*",
    "These images of voluptuousness made him clench his fists, and a shiver run along his spine.--*Paris*",
    "One night, among others, they heated so cruelly his virgin and priestly blood, that he bit his pillow, leaped from his bed, flung on a surplice over his shirt, and left his cell, lamp in hand, half naked, wild, his eyes aflame.--*Paris*",
    "He knew where to find the key to the red door, which connected the cloister with the church, and he always had about him, as the reader knows, the key of the staircase leading to the towers.--*Paris*",
    "Book 9 Chapter 6 Continuation Of The Key To The Red Door--*Paris*",
    "That night, la Esmeralda had fallen asleep in her cell, full of oblivion, of hope, and of sweet thoughts.--*Paris*",
    "She had already been asleep for some time, dreaming as always, of Phoebus, when it seemed to her that she heard a noise near her.--*Paris*",
    "She slept lightly and uneasily, the sleep of a bird; a mere nothing waked her.--*Paris*",
    "She opened her eyes.--*Paris*",
    "The night was very dark.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, she saw a figure gazing at her through the window; a lamp lighted up this apparition.--*Paris*",
    "The moment that the figure saw that la Esmeralda had perceived it, it blew out the lamp.--*Paris*",
    "But the young girl had had time to catch a glimpse of it; her eyes closed again with terror.--*Paris*",
    "All her past unhappiness came back to her like a flash of lightning.--*Paris*",
    "She fell back on her bed, chilled.--*Paris*",
    "A moment later she felt a touch along her body which made her shudder so that she straightened herself up in a sitting posture, wide awake and furious.--*Paris*",
    "The priest had just slipped in beside her.--*Paris*",
    "He encircled her with both arms.--*Paris*",
    "She tried to scream and could not.--*Paris*",
    "She seized his bald head by its remnant of hair and tried to thrust aside his kisses as though they had been bites.--*Paris*",
    "She stopped his two arms with superhuman force.--*Paris*",
    "He released her.--*Paris*",
    "Then she struck him with the fury of a child.--*Paris*",
    "She made her beautiful hands stiff to bruise his face.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she felt him stronger than herself.--*Paris*",
    "She was conquered, palpitating in his arms, and in his power.--*Paris*",
    "She felt a wanton hand straying over her.--*Paris*",
    "She made a last effort, and began to cry: \"Help!--*Paris*",
    "Help!--*Paris*",
    "A vampire!--*Paris*",
    "a vampire!\"--*Paris*",
    "Nothing came.--*Paris*",
    "Djali alone was awake and bleating with anguish.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy's hand came in contact with something cold and metal- lic-it was Quasimodo's whistle.--*Paris*",
    "She seized it with a convulsive hope, raised it to her lips and blew with all the strength that she had left.--*Paris*",
    "The whistle gave a clear, piercing sound.--*Paris*",
    "Almost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm.--*Paris*",
    "The cell was dark; he could not distinguish clearly who it was that held him thus; but he heard teeth chattering with rage, and there was just sufficient light scattered among the gloom to allow him to see above his head the blade of a large knife.--*Paris*",
    "The priest fancied that he perceived the form of Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "He assumed that it could be no one but he.--*Paris*",
    "He remembered to have stumbled, as he entered, over a bundle which was stretched across the door on the outside.--*Paris*",
    "But, as the newcomer did not utter a word, he knew not what to think.--*Paris*",
    "He flung himself on the arm which held the knife, crying: \"Quasimodo!\"--*Paris*",
    "He forgot, at that moment of distress, that Quasimodo was deaf.--*Paris*",
    "In a twinkling, the priest was overthrown and a leaden knee rested on his breast.--*Paris*",
    "From the angular imprint of that knee he recognized Quasimodo; but what was to be done?--*Paris*",
    "how could he make the other recognize him?--*Paris*",
    "the darkness rendered the deaf man blind.--*Paris*",
    "He was lost.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl, pitiless as an enraged tigress, did not intervene to save him.--*Paris*",
    "The knife was approaching his head; the moment was critical.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, his adversary seemed stricken with hesitation.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, Quasimodo's voice.--*Paris*",
    "Then the priest felt a large hand dragging him feet first out of the cell; it was there that he was to die.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately for him, the moon had risen a few moments before.--*Paris*",
    "When they had passed through the door of the cell, its pale rays fell upon the priest's countenance.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy, who had advanced to the threshold of her cell, beheld with surprise their roles abruptly changed.--*Paris*",
    "It was now the priest who menaced, Quasimodo who was the suppliant.--*Paris*",
    "The priest, who was overwhelming the deaf man with gestures of wrath and reproach, made the latter a violent sign to retire.--*Paris*",
    "The deaf man dropped his head, then he came and knelt at the gypsy's door,--\"Monseigneur,\" he said, in a grave and resigned voice, \"you shall do all that you please afterwards, but kill me first.\"--*Paris*",
    "So saying, he presented his knife to the priest.--*Paris*",
    "The priest, beside himself, was about to seize it.--*Paris*",
    "But the young girl was quicker than be; she wrenched the knife from Quasimodo's hands and burst into a frantic laugh,--\"Approach,\" she said to the priest.--*Paris*",
    "She held the blade high.--*Paris*",
    "The priest remained undecided.--*Paris*",
    "She would certainly have struck him.--*Paris*",
    "Then she added with a pitiless expression, well aware that she was about to pierce the priest's heart with thousands of red-hot irons,----*Paris*",
    "The priest overturned Quasimodo on the floor with a kick, and, quivering with rage, darted back under the vault of the staircase.--*Paris*",
    "When he was gone, Quasimodo picked up the whistle which had just saved the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl, deeply agitated by this violent scene, fell back exhausted on her bed, and began to sob and weep.--*Paris*",
    "Her horizon was becoming gloomy once more.--*Paris*",
    "The priest had groped his way back to his cell.--*Paris*",

    "Book 10 Chapter 1 Gringoire Has Many Good Ideas In Succession--*Paris*",
    "As soon as Pierre Gringoire had seen how this whole affair was turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had not cared to identify himself with the matter further.--*Paris*",
    "The outcasts with whom he had remained, reflecting that, after all, it was the best company in Paris,--the outcasts had continued to interest themselves in behalf of the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "He had thought it very simple on the part of people who had, like herself, nothing else in prospect but Charmolue and Torterue, and who, unlike himself, did not gallop through the regions of imagination between the wings of Pegasus.--*Paris*",
    "From their remarks, he had learned that his wife of the broken crock had taken refuge in Notre-Dame, and he was very glad of it.--*Paris*",
    "But he felt no temptation to go and see her there.--*Paris*",
    "He meditated occasionally on the little goat, and that was all.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he was busy executing feats of strength during the day for his living, and at night he was engaged in composing a memorial against the Bishop of Paris, for he remembered having been drenched by the wheels of his mills, and he cherished a grudge against him for it.--*Paris*",
    "He also occupied himself with annotating the fine work of Baudry-le- Rouge, Bishop of Noyon and Tournay, _De Cupa Petrarum_, which had given him a violent passion for architecture, an inclination which had replaced in his heart his passion for hermeticism, of which it was, moreover, only a natural corollary, since there is an intimate relation between hermeticism and masonry.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire had passed from the love of an idea to the love of the form of that idea.--*Paris*",
    "One day he had halted near Saint Germain-l'Auxerrois, at the corner of a mansion called \"For-l'Ev\u00eaque \" (the Bishop's Tribunal), which stood opposite another called \"For-le-Roi\" (the King's Tribunal).--*Paris*",
    "At this For-l'Ev\u00eaque, there was a charming chapel of the fourteenth century, whose apse was on the street.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire was devoutly examining its exterior sculptures.--*Paris*",
    "He was in one of those moments of egotistical, exclusive, supreme, enjoyment when the artist beholds nothing in the world but art, and the world in art.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he feels a hand laid gravely on his shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "He turns round.--*Paris*",
    "It was his old friend, his former master, monsieur the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "He was stupefied.--*Paris*",
    "It was a long time since he had seen the archdeacon, and Dom Claude was one of those solemn and impassioned men, a meeting with whom always upsets the equilibrium of a sceptical philosopher.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon maintained silence for several minutes, during which Gringoire had time to observe him.--*Paris*",
    "He found Dom Claude greatly changed; pale as a winter's morning, with hollow eyes, and hair almost white.--*Paris*",
    "The priest broke the silence at length, by saying, in a tranquil but glacial tone,----*Paris*",
    "The priest began to smile with that bitter smile which raises only one corner of the mouth.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude interrupted him,----*Paris*",
    "Gringoire replied warmly;----*Paris*",

    "After a silence, the priest resumed,----*Paris*",
    "At that moment, a trampling of horses was heard, and our two interlocutors beheld defiling at the end of the street, a company of the king's unattached archers, their lances borne high, an officer at their head.--*Paris*",
    "The cavalcade was brilliant, and its march resounded on the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "From the moment of that troop's passing, some agitation had pierced through the archdeacon's glacial envelope.--*Paris*",
    "He walked on.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire followed him, being accustomed to obey him, like all who had once approached that man so full of ascendency.--*Paris*",

    "The archdeacon resumed after a silence,----*Paris*",
    "The priest smote his brow.--*Paris*",
    "In spite of the calm which he affected, a violent gesture betrayed his internal convulsions from time to time.--*Paris*",

    "Gringoire smote his brow in his turn.--*Paris*",

    "The archdeacon spoke imperiously.\"--*Paris*",
    "The priest was vehement.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire listened to him at first with an undecided air, then he became touched, and wound up with a grimace which made his pallid face resemble that of a new-born infant with an attack of the colic.--*Paris*",
    "The priest interrupted him: \"Is it agreed.\"--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon gave him his hand: \"It is settled, then?--*Paris*",
    "You will come to-morrow?\"--*Paris*",

    "Gringoire was radiant.--*Paris*",
    "He broke off.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire bent his head to the archdeacon's head and spoke to him in a very low voice, casting an uneasy glance the while from one end to the other of the street, though no one was passing.--*Paris*",

    "Book 10 Chapter 2 Turn Vagabond--*Paris*",
    "On re-entering the cloister, the archdeacon found at the door of his cell his brother Jehan du Moulin, who was waiting for him, and who had beguiled the tedium of waiting by drawing on the wall with a bit of charcoal, a profile of his elder brother, enriched with a monstrous nose.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude hardly looked at his brother; his thoughts were elsewhere.--*Paris*",
    "That merry scamp's face whose beaming had so often restored serenity to the priest's sombre physiognomy, was now powerless to melt the gloom which grew more dense every day over that corrupted, mephitic, and stagnant soul.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon did not even raise his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "Then the scholar said, with an air which was both grave and resolute: \"Well, brother, I am sorry to be obliged to tell you that very fine offers and propositions are being made to me in another quarter.--*Paris*",
    "You will not give me any money?--*Paris*",
    "No.--*Paris*",
    "In that case I shall become a professional vagabond.\"--*Paris*",
    "As he uttered these monstrous words, he assumed the mien of Ajax, expecting to see the lightnings descend upon his head.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon said coldly to him,---*Paris*",
    "Jehan made him a deep bow, and descended the cloister stairs, whistling.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he was passing through the courtyard of the cloister, beneath his brother's window, he heard that window open, raised his eyes and beheld the archdeacon's severe head emerge.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time, the priest flung Jehan a purse, which gave the scholar a big bump on the forehead, and with which Jehan retreated, both vexed and content, like a dog who had been stoned with marrow bones.--*Paris*",
    "Book 10 Chapter 3 Long Live Mirth--*Paris*",
    "The reader has probably not forgotten that a part of the Cour de Miracles was enclosed by the ancient wall which surrounded the city, a goodly number of whose towers had begun, even at that epoch, to fall to ruin.--*Paris*",
    "One of these towers had been converted into a pleasure resort by the vagabonds.--*Paris*",
    "There was a drain-shop in the underground story, and the rest in the upper stories.--*Paris*",
    "This was the most lively, and consequently the most hideous, point of the whole outcast den.--*Paris*",
    "It was a sort of monstrous hive, which buzzed there night and day.--*Paris*",
    "At night, when the remainder of the beggar horde slept, when there was no longer a window lighted in the dingy fa?ades of the Place, when not a cry was any longer to be heard proceeding from those innumerable families, those ant-hills of thieves, of wenches, and stolen or bastard children, the merry tower was still recognizable by the noise which it made, by the scarlet light which, flashing simultaneously from the air-holes, the windows, the fissures in the cracked walls, escaped, so to speak, from its every pore.--*Paris*",
    "The cellar then, was the dram-shop.--*Paris*",
    "The descent to it was through a low door and by a staircase as steep as a classic Alexandrine.--*Paris*",
    "Over the door, by way of a sign there hung a marvellous daub, representing new sons and dead chickens,* with this, pun below: ~Aux sonneurs pour les tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s~,--The wringers for the dead.--*Paris*",
    "One evening when the curfew was sounding from all the belfries in Paris, the sergeants of the watch might have observed, had it been granted to them to enter the formidable Court of Miracles, that more tumult than usual was in progress in the vagabonds' tavern, that more drinking was being done, and louder swearing.--*Paris*",
    "Outside in the Place, there, were many groups conversing in low tones, as when some great plan is being framed, and here and there a knave crouching down engaged in sharpening a villanous iron blade on a paving-stone.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, in the tavern itself, wine and gaming offered such a powerful diversion to the ideas which occupied the vagabonds' lair that evening, that it would have been difficult to divine from the remarks of the drinkers, what was the matter in hand.--*Paris*",
    "They merely wore a gayer air than was their wont, and some weapon could be seen glittering between the legs of each of them,--a sickle, an axe, a big two-edged sword or the hook of an old hackbut.--*Paris*",
    "The room, circular in form, was very spacious; but the tables were so thickly set and the drinkers so numerous, that all that the tavern contained, men, women, benches, beer-jugs, all that were drinking, all that were sleeping, all that were playing, the well, the lame, seemed piled up pell-mell, with as much order and harmony as a heap of oyster shells.--*Paris*",
    "There were a few tallow dips lighted on the tables; but the real luminary of this tavern, that which played the part in this dram-shop of the chandelier of an opera house, was the fire.--*Paris*",
    "This cellar was so damp that the fire was never allowed to go out, even in midsummer; an immense chimney with a sculptured mantel, all bristling with heavy iron andirons and cooking utensils, with one of those huge fires of mixed wood and peat which at night, in village streets make the reflection of forge windows stand out so red on the opposite walls.--*Paris*",
    "A big dog gravely seated in the ashes was turning a spit loaded with meat before the coals.--*Paris*",
    "Great as was the confusion, after the first glance one could distinguish in that multitude, three principal groups which thronged around three personages already known to the reader.--*Paris*",
    "One of these personages, fantastically accoutred in many an oriental rag, was Mathias Hungadi Spicali, Duke of Egypt and Bohemia.--*Paris*",
    "The knave was seated on a table with his legs crossed, and in a loud voice was bestowing his knowledge of magic, both black and white, on many a gaping face which surrounded him.--*Paris*",
    "Another rabble pressed close around our old friend, the valiant King of Thunes, armed to the teeth.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin Trouillefou, with a very serious air and in a low voice, was regulating the distribution of an enormous cask of arms, which stood wide open in front of him and from whence poured out in profusion, axes, swords, bassinets, coats of mail, broadswords, lance-heads, arrows, and viretons,* like apples and grapes from a horn of plenty.--*Paris*",
    "Every one took something from the cask, one a morion, another a long, straight sword, another a dagger with a cross--shaped hilt.--*Paris*",
    "The very children were arming themselves, and there were even cripples in bowls who, in armor and cuirass, made their way between the legs of the drinkers, like great beetles.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, a third audience, the most noisy, the most jovial, and the most numerous, encumbered benches and tables, in the midst of which harangued and swore a flute-like voice, which escaped from beneath a heavy armor, complete from casque to spurs.--*Paris*",
    "The individual who had thus screwed a whole outfit upon his body, was so hidden by his warlike accoutrements that nothing was to be seen of his person save an impertinent, red, snub nose, a rosy mouth, and bold eyes.--*Paris*",
    "His belt was full of daggers and poniards, a huge sword on his hip, a rusted cross-bow at his left, and a vast jug of wine in front of him, without reckoning on his right, a fat wench with her bosom uncovered.--*Paris*",
    "All mouths around him were laughing, cursing, and drinking.--*Paris*",
    "Add twenty secondary groups, the waiters, male and female, running with jugs on their heads, gamblers squatting over taws, merelles,* dice, vachettes, the ardent game of tringlet, quarrels in one corner, kisses in another, and the reader will have some idea of this whole picture, over which flickered the light of a great, flaming fire, which made a thousand huge and grotesque shadows dance over the walls of the drinking shop.--*Paris*",
    "As for the noise, it was like the inside of a bell at full peal.--*Paris*",
    "The dripping-pan, where crackled a rain of grease, filled with its continual sputtering the intervals of these thousand dialogues, which intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of this uproar, at the extremity of the tavern, on the bench inside the chimney, sat a philosopher meditating with his feet in the ashes and his eyes on the brands.--*Paris*",
    "It was Pierre Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "A wench was humming,----*Paris*",
    "Two card players were disputing,----*Paris*",
    "The voice of the young scamp armed from head to foot, dominated the uproar.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the rabble applauded with shouts of laughter; and seeing that the tumult was increasing around him, the scholar cried,--.--*Paris*",
    "There was a moment of partial silence, during which the sharp voice of the Duke of Egypt rose, as he gave instructions to his Bohemians.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the vagabonds continued to arm themselves and whisper at the other end of the dram-shop.--*Paris*",
    "Here they served Jehan with his supper.--*Paris*",
    "As he threw himself back on the bosom of the wench beside him, he exclaimed,----*Paris*",
    "chin.--*Paris*",
    "And then, I am like the Marshal de Gi\u00e9 at the siege of Pontoise, I have my right resting on a hillock.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, Clopin Trouillefou had finished the distribution of arms.--*Paris*",
    "He approached Gringoire, who appeared to be plunged in a profound revery, with his feet on an andiron.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire turned to him with a melancholy smile.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin approached the Duke of Egypt.--*Paris*",
    "Chopin quitted the dram-shop.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, Jehan was shouting in a hoarse voice:--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire, torn from his meditations, began to watch the wild and noisy scene which surrounded him, muttering between his teeth: \"~Luxuriosa res vinum et tumultuosa ebrietas~.--*Paris*",
    "Alas!--*Paris*",
    "what good reason I have not to drink, and how excellently spoke Saint-Benoit: '~Vinum apostatare facit etiam sapientes!'\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, Clopin returned and shouted in a voice of thunder: \"Midnight!\"--*Paris*",
    "At this word, which produced the effect of the call to boot and saddle on a regiment at a halt, all the outcasts, men, women, children, rushed in a mass from the tavern, with great noise of arms and old iron implements.--*Paris*",
    "The moon was obscured.--*Paris*",
    "The Cour des Miracles was entirely dark.--*Paris*",
    "There was not a single light.--*Paris*",
    "One could make out there a throng of men and women conversing in low tones.--*Paris*",
    "They could be heard buzzing, and a gleam of all sorts of weapons was visible in the darkness.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin mounted a large stone.--*Paris*",
    "A movement began in the darkness.--*Paris*",
    "The immense multitude appeared to form in a column.--*Paris*",
    "After a few minutes, the King of Thunes raised his voice once more,----*Paris*",
    "Ten minutes later, the cavaliers of the watch fled in terror before a long procession of black and silent men which was descending towards the Pont an Change, through the tortuous streets which pierce the close-built neighborhood of the markets in every direction.--*Paris*",
    "Book 10 Chapter 4 An Awkward Friend--*Paris*",
    "That night, Quasimodo did not sleep.--*Paris*",
    "He had just made his last round of the church.--*Paris*",
    "He had not noticed, that at the moment when he was closing the doors, the archdeacon had passed close to him and betrayed some displeasure on seeing him bolting and barring with care the enormous iron locks which gave to their large leaves the solidity of a wall.--*Paris*",
    "Dom Claude's air was even more preoccupied than usual.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, since the nocturnal adventure in the cell, he had constantly abused Quasimodo, but in vain did he ill treat, and even beat him occasionally, nothing disturbed the submission, patience, the devoted resignation of the faithful bellringer.--*Paris*",
    "He endured everything on the part of the archdeacon, insults, threats, blows, without murmuring a complaint.--*Paris*",
    "At the most, he gazed uneasily after Dom Claude when the latter ascended the staircase of the tower; but the archdeacon had abstained from presenting himself again before the gypsy's eyes.--*Paris*",
    "On that night, accordingly, Quasimodo, after having cast a glance at his poor bells which he so neglected now, Jacqueline, Marie, and Thibauld, mounted to the summit of the Northern tower, and there setting his dark lanturn, well closed, upon the leads, he began to gaze at Paris.--*Paris*",
    "The night, as we have already said, was very dark.--*Paris*",
    "Paris which, so to speak was not lighted at that epoch, presented to the eye a confused collection of black masses, cut here and there by the whitish curve of the Seine.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo no longer saw any light with the exception of one window in a distant edifice, whose vague and sombre profile was outlined well above the roofs, in the direction of the Porte Sainte-Antoine.--*Paris*",
    "There also, there was some one awake.--*Paris*",
    "As the only eye of the bellringer peered into that horizon of mist and night, he felt within him an inexpressible uneasiness.--*Paris*",
    "For several days he had been upon his guard.--*Paris*",
    "He had perceived men of sinister mien, who never took their eyes from the young girl's asylum, prowling constantly about the church.--*Paris*",
    "He fancied that some plot might be in process of formation against the unhappy refugee.--*Paris*",
    "He imagined that there existed a popular hatred against her, as against himself, and that it was very possible that something might happen soon.--*Paris*",
    "Hence he remained upon his tower on the watch, \"dreaming in his dream-place,\" as Rabelais says, with his eye directed alternately on the cell and on Paris, keeping faithful guard, like a good dog, with a thousand suspicions in his mind.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, while he was scrutinizing the great city with that eye which nature, by a sort of compensation, had made so piercing that it could almost supply the other organs which Quasimodo lacked, it seemed to him that there was something singular about the Quay de la Vieille-Pelleterie, that there was a movement at that point, that the line of the parapet, standing out blackly against the whiteness of the water was not straight and tranquil, like that of the other quays, but that it undulated to the eye, like the waves of a river, or like the heads of a crowd in motion.--*Paris*",
    "This struck him as strange.--*Paris*",
    "He redoubled his attention.--*Paris*",
    "The movement seemed to be advancing towards the City.--*Paris*",
    "There was no light.--*Paris*",
    "It lasted for some time on the quay; then it gradually ceased, as though that which was passing were entering the interior of the island; then it stopped altogether, and the line of the quay became straight and motionless again.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when Quasimodo was lost in conjectures, it seemed to him that the movement had re-appeared in the Rue du Parvis, which is prolonged into the city perpendicularly to the fa?ade of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "At length, dense as was the darkness, he beheld the head of a column debouch from that street, and in an instant a crowd--of which nothing could be distinguished in the gloom except that it was a crowd--spread over the Place.--*Paris*",
    "This spectacle had a terror of its own.--*Paris*",
    "It is probable that this singular procession, which seemed so desirous of concealing itself under profound darkness, maintained a silence no less profound.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, some noise must have escaped it, were it only a trampling.--*Paris*",
    "But this noise did not even reach our deaf man, and this great multitude, of which he saw hardly anything, and of which he heard nothing, though it was marching and moving so near him, produced upon him the effect of a rabble of dead men, mute, impalpable, lost in a smoke.--*Paris*",
    "It seemed to him, that he beheld advancing towards him a fog of men, and that he saw shadows moving in the shadow.--*Paris*",
    "Then his fears returned to him, the idea of an attempt against the gypsy presented itself once more to his mind.--*Paris*",
    "He was conscious, in a confused way, that a violent crisis was approaching.--*Paris*",
    "At that critical moment he took counsel with himself, with better and prompter reasoning than one would have expected from so badly organized a brain.--*Paris*",
    "Ought he to awaken the gypsy?--*Paris*",
    "to make her escape?--*Paris*",
    "Whither?--*Paris*",
    "The streets were invested, the church backed on the river.--*Paris*",
    "No boat, no issue!--There was but one thing to be done; to allow himself to be killed on the threshold of Notre-Dame, to resist at least until succor arrived, if it should arrive, and not to trouble la Esmeralda's sleep.--*Paris*",
    "This resolution once taken, he set to examining the enemy with more tranquillity.--*Paris*",
    "The throng seemed to increase every moment in the church square.--*Paris*",
    "Only, he presumed that it must be making very little noise, since the windows on the Place remained closed.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, a flame flashed up, and in an instant seven or eight lighted torches passed over the heads of the crowd, shaking their tufts of flame in the deep shade.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo then beheld distinctly surging in the Parvis a frightful herd of men and women in rags, armed with scythes, pikes, billhooks and partisans, whose thousand points glittered.--*Paris*",
    "Here and there black pitchforks formed horns to the hideous faces.--*Paris*",
    "He vaguely recalled this populace, and thought that he recognized all the heads who had saluted him as Pope of the Fools some months previously.--*Paris*",
    "One man who held a torch in one hand and a club in the other, mounted a stone post and seemed to be haranguing them.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time the strange army executed several evolutions, as though it were taking up its post around the church.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo picked up his lantern and descended to the platform between the towers, in order to get a nearer view, and to spy out a means of defence.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin Trouillefou, on arriving in front of the lofty portal of Notre-Dame had, in fact, ranged his troops in order of battle.--*Paris*",
    "Although he expected no resistance, he wished, like a prudent general, to preserve an order which would permit him to face, at need, a sudden attack of the watch or the police.--*Paris*",
    "He had accordingly stationed his brigade in such a manner that, viewed from above and from a distance, one would have pronounced it the Roman triangle of the battle of Ecnomus, the boar's head of Alexander or the famous wedge of Gustavus Adolphus.--*Paris*",
    "The base of this triangle rested on the back of the Place in such a manner as to bar the entrance of the Rue du Parvis; one of its sides faced H?tel-Dieu, the other the Rue Saint-Pierre-aux-Boeufs.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin Trouillefou had placed himself at the apex with the Duke of Egypt, our friend Jehan, and the most daring of the scavengers.--*Paris*",
    "An enterprise like that which the vagabonds were now undertaking against Notre-Dame was not a very rare thing in the cities of the Middle Ages.--*Paris*",
    "What we now call the \"police\" did not exist then.--*Paris*",
    "In populous cities, especially in capitals, there existed no single, central, regulating power.--*Paris*",
    "Feudalism had constructed these great communities in a singular manner.--*Paris*",
    "A city was an assembly of a thousand seigneuries, which divided it into compartments of all shapes and sizes.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, a thousand conflicting establishments of police; that is to say, no police at all.--*Paris*",
    "In Paris, for example, independently of the hundred and forty-one lords who laid claim to a manor, there were five and twenty who laid claim to a manor and to administering justice, from the Bishop of Paris, who had five hundred streets, to the Prior of Notre- Dame des Champs, who had four.--*Paris*",
    "All these feudal justices recognized the suzerain authority of the king only in name.--*Paris*",
    "All possessed the right of control over the roads.--*Paris*",
    "All were at home.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI., that indefatigable worker, who so largely began the demolition of the feudal edifice, continued by Richelieu and Louis XIV.--*Paris*",
    "for the profit of royalty, and finished by Mirabeau for the benefit of the people,--Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "had certainly made an effort to break this network of seignories which covered Paris, by throwing violently across them all two or three troops of general police.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, in 1465, an order to the inhabitants to light candles in their windows at nightfall, and to shut up their dogs under penalty of death; in the same year, an order to close the streets in the evening with iron chains, and a prohibition to wear daggers or weapons of offence in the streets at night.--*Paris*",
    "But in a very short time, all these efforts at communal legislation fell into abeyance.--*Paris*",
    "The bourgeois permitted the wind to blow out their candles in the windows, and their dogs to stray; the iron chains were stretched only in a state of siege; the prohibition to wear daggers wrought no other changes than from the name of the Rue Coupe-Gueule to the name of the Rue-Coupe-Gorge* which is an evident progress.--*Paris*",
    "The old scaffolding of feudal jurisdictions remained standing; an immense aggregation of bailiwicks and seignories crossing each other all over the city, interfering with each other, entangled in one another, enmeshing each other, trespassing on each other; a useless thicket of watches, sub-watches and counter-watches, over which, with armed force, passed brigandage, rapine, and sedition.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, in this disorder, deeds of violence on the part of the populace directed against a palace, a hotel, or house in the most thickly populated quarters, were not unheard-of occurrences.--*Paris*",
    "In the majority of such cases, the neighbors did not meddle with the matter unless the pillaging extended to themselves.--*Paris*",
    "They stopped up their ears to the musket shots, closed their shutters, barricaded their doors, allowed the matter to be concluded with or without the watch, and the next day it was said in Paris, \"Etienne Barbette was broken open last night.--*Paris*",
    "The Marshal de Clermont was seized last night, etc.\"--*Paris*",
    "Hence, not only the royal habitations, the Louvre, the Palace, the Bastille, the Tournelles, but simply seignorial residences, the Petit-Bourbon, the H?tel de Sens, the H?tel d' Angoul\u00eame, etc., had battlements on their walls, and machicolations over their doors.--*Paris*",
    "Churches were guarded by their sanctity.--*Paris*",
    "Some, among the number Notre-Dame, were fortified.--*Paris*",
    "The Abbey of Saint-German-des-Pres was castellated like a baronial mansion, and more brass expended about it in bombards than in bells.--*Paris*",
    "Its fortress was still to be seen in 1610.--*Paris*",
    "To-day, barely its church remains.--*Paris*",
    "Let us return to Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "When the first arrangements were completed, and we must say, to the honor of vagabond discipline, that Clopin's orders were executed in silence, and with admirable precision, the worthy chief of the band, mounted on the parapet of the church square, and raised his hoarse and surly voice, turning towards Notre-Dame, and brandishing his torch whose light, tossed by the wind, and veiled every moment by its own smoke, made the reddish fa?ade of the church appear and disappear before the eye.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo could not, unfortunately, hear these words uttered with a sort of sombre and savage majesty.--*Paris*",
    "A vagabond presented his banner to Clopin, who planted it solemnly between two paving-stones.--*Paris*",
    "It was a pitchfork from whose points hung a bleeding quarter of carrion meat.--*Paris*",
    "That done, the King of Thunes turned round and cast his eyes over his army, a fierce multitude whose glances flashed almost equally with their pikes.--*Paris*",
    "After a momentary pause,--\"Forward, my Sons!\"--*Paris*",
    "he cried; \"to work, locksmiths!\"--*Paris*",
    "Thirty bold men, square shouldered, and with pick-lock faces, stepped from the ranks, with hammers, pincers, and bars of iron on their shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "They betook themselves to the principal door of the church, ascended the steps, and were soon to be seen squatting under the arch, working at the door with pincers and levers; a throng of vagabonds followed them to help or look on.--*Paris*",
    "The eleven steps before the portal were covered with them.--*Paris*",
    "But the door stood firm.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin was interrupted by a frightful uproar which re- sounded behind him at that moment.--*Paris*",
    "He wheeled round.--*Paris*",
    "An enormous beam had just fallen from above; it had crushed a dozen vagabonds on the pavement with the sound of a cannon, breaking in addition, legs here and there in the crowd of beggars, who sprang aside with cries of terror.--*Paris*",
    "In a twinkling, the narrow precincts of the church parvis were cleared.--*Paris*",
    "The locksmiths, although protected by the deep vaults of the portal, abandoned the door and Clopin himself retired to a respectful distance from the church.--*Paris*",
    "It is impossible to describe the astonishment mingled with fright which fell upon the ruffians in company with this beam.--*Paris*",
    "They remained for several minutes with their eyes in the air, more dismayed by that piece of wood than by the king's twenty thousand archers.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, nothing could be distinguished on the fa?ade, to whose summit the light of the torches did not reach.--*Paris*",
    "The heavy beam lay in the middle of the enclosure, and groans were heard from the poor wretches who had received its first shock, and who had been almost cut in twain, on the angle of the stone steps.--*Paris*",
    "The King of Thunes, his first amazement passed, finally found an explanation which appeared plausible to his companions.--*Paris*",
    "At this detonation, the peaceable inhabitants of the surrounding houses woke up; many windows were seen to open, and nightcaps and hands holding candles appeared at the casements.--*Paris*",
    "No one took a step.--*Paris*",
    "An old locksmith addressed him----*Paris*",
    "The King of Thunes ran boldly to the formidable beam, and placed his foot upon it: \"Here is one!\"--*Paris*",
    "he exclaimed; \"'tis the canons who send it to you.\"--*Paris*",
    "And, making a mocking salute in the direction of the church, \"Thanks, canons!\"--*Paris*",
    "This piece of bravado produced its effects,--the spell of the beam was broken.--*Paris*",
    "The vagabonds recovered their courage; soon the heavy joist, raised like a feather by two hundred vigorous arms, was flung with fury against the great door which they had tried to batter down.--*Paris*",
    "At the sight of that long beam, in the half-light which the infrequent torches of the brigands spread over the Place, thus borne by that crowd of men who dashed it at a run against the church, one would have thought that he beheld a monstrous beast with a thousand feet attacking with lowered head the giant of stone.--*Paris*",
    "At the shock of the beam, the half metallic door sounded like an immense drum; it was not burst in, but the whole cathedral trembled, and the deepest cavities of the edifice were heard to echo.--*Paris*",
    "At the same moment, a shower of large stones began to fall from the top of the fa?ade on the assailants.--*Paris*",
    "But the impulse had been given, the King of Thunes had set the example.--*Paris*",
    "Evidently, the bishop was defending himself, and they only battered the door with the more rage, in spite of the stones which cracked skulls right and left.--*Paris*",
    "It was remarkable that all these stones fell one by one; but they followed each other closely.--*Paris*",
    "The thieves always felt two at a time, one on their legs and one on their heads.--*Paris*",
    "There were few which did not deal their blow, and a large layer of dead and wounded lay bleeding and panting beneath the feet of the assailants who, now grown furious, replaced each other without intermission.--*Paris*",
    "The long beam continued to belabor the door, at regular intervals, like the clapper of a bell, the stones to rain down, the door to groan.--*Paris*",
    "The reader has no doubt divined that this unexpected resistance which had exasperated the outcasts came from Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "Chance had, unfortunately, favored the brave deaf man.--*Paris*",
    "When he had descended to the platform between the towers, his ideas were all in confusion.--*Paris*",
    "He had run up and down along the gallery for several minutes like a madman, surveying from above, the compact mass of vagabonds ready to hurl itself on the church, demanding the safety of the gypsy from the devil or from God.--*Paris*",
    "The thought had occurred to him of ascending to the southern belfry and sounding the alarm, but before he could have set the bell in motion, before Marie's voice could have uttered a single clamor, was there not time to burst in the door of the church ten times over?--*Paris*",
    "It was precisely the moment when the locksmiths were advancing upon it with their tools.--*Paris*",
    "What was to be done?--*Paris*",
    "All at once, he remembered that some masons had been at work all day repairing the wall, the timber-work, and the roof of the south tower.--*Paris*",
    "This was a flash of light.--*Paris*",
    "The wall was of stone, the roof of lead, the timber-work of wood.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo hastened to that tower.--*Paris*",
    "The lower chambers were, in fact, full of materials.--*Paris*",
    "There were piles of rough blocks of stone, sheets of lead in rolls, bundles of laths, heavy beams already notched with the saw, heaps of plaster.--*Paris*",
    "Time was pressing, The pikes and hammers were at work below.--*Paris*",
    "With a strength which the sense of danger increased tenfold, he seized one of the beams--the longest and heaviest; he pushed it out through a loophole, then, grasping it again outside of the tower, he made it slide along the angle of the balustrade which surrounds the platform, and let it fly into the abyss.--*Paris*",
    "The enormous timber, during that fall of a hundred and sixty feet, scraping the wall, breaking the carvings, turned many times on its centre, like the arm of a windmill flying off alone through space.--*Paris*",
    "At last it reached the ground, the horrible cry arose, and the black beam, as it rebounded from the pavement, resembled a serpent leaping.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo beheld the outcasts scatter at the fall of the beam, like ashes at the breath of a child.--*Paris*",
    "He took advantage of their fright, and while they were fixing a superstitious glance on the club which had fallen from heaven, and while they were putting out the eyes of the stone saints on the front with a discharge of arrows and buckshot, Quasimodo was silently piling up plaster, stones, and rough blocks of stone, even the sacks of tools belonging to the masons, on the edge of the balustrade from which the beam had already been hurled.--*Paris*",
    "Thus, as soon as they began to batter the grand door, the shower of rough blocks of stone began to fall, and it seemed to them that the church itself was being demolished over their heads.--*Paris*",
    "Any one who could have beheld Quasimodo at that moment would have been frightened.--*Paris*",
    "Independently of the projectiles which he had piled upon the balustrade, he had collected a heap of stones on the platform itself.--*Paris*",
    "As fast as the blocks on the exterior edge were exhausted, he drew on the heap.--*Paris*",
    "Then he stooped and rose, stooped and rose again with incredible activity.--*Paris*",
    "His huge gnome's head bent over the balustrade, then an enormous stone fell, then another, then another.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time, he followed a fine stone with his eye, and when it did good execution, he said, \"Hum!\"--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the beggars did not grow discouraged.--*Paris*",
    "The thick door on which they were venting their fury had already trembled more than twenty times beneath the weight of their oaken battering-ram, multiplied by the strength of a hundred men.--*Paris*",
    "The panels cracked, the carved work flew into splinters, the hinges, at every blow, leaped from their pins, the planks yawned, the wood crumbled to powder, ground between the iron sheathing.--*Paris*",
    "Fortunately for Quasimodo, there was more iron than wood.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he felt that the great door was yielding.--*Paris*",
    "Although he did not hear it, every blow of the ram reverberated simultaneously in the vaults of the church and within it.--*Paris*",
    "From above he beheld the vagabonds, filled with triumph and rage, shaking their fists at the gloomy fa?ade; and both on the gypsy's account and his own he envied the wings of the owls which flitted away above his head in flocks.--*Paris*",
    "His shower of stone blocks was not sufficient to repel the assailants.--*Paris*",
    "At this moment of anguish, he noticed, a little lower down than the balustrade whence he was crushing the thieves, two long stone gutters which discharged immediately over the great door; the internal orifice of these gutters terminated on the pavement of the platform.--*Paris*",
    "An idea occurred to him; he ran in search of a fagot in his bellringer's den, placed on this fagot a great many bundles of laths, and many rolls of lead, munitions which he had not employed so far, and having arranged this pile in front of the hole to the two gutters, he set it on fire with his lantern.--*Paris*",
    "During this time, since the stones no longer fell, the outcasts ceased to gaze into the air.--*Paris*",
    "The bandits, panting like a pack of hounds who are forcing a boar into his lair, pressed tumultuously round the great door, all disfigured by the battering ram, but still standing.--*Paris*",
    "They were waiting with a quiver for the great blow which should split it open.--*Paris*",
    "They vied with each other in pressing as close as possible, in order to dash among the first, when it should open, into that opulent cathedral, a vast reservoir where the wealth of three centuries had been piled up.--*Paris*",
    "They reminded each other with roars of exultation and greedy lust, of the beautiful silver crosses, the fine copes of brocade, the beautiful tombs of silver gilt, the great magnificences of the choir, the dazzling festivals, the Christmasses sparkling with torches, the Easters sparkling with sunshine,--all those splendid solemneties wherein chandeliers, ciboriums, tabernacles, and reliquaries, studded the altars with a crust of gold and diamonds.--*Paris*",
    "Certainly, at that fine moment, thieves and pseudo sufferers, doctors in stealing, and vagabonds, were thinking much less of delivering the gypsy than of pillaging Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "We could even easily believe that for a goodly number among them la Esmeralda was only a pretext, if thieves needed pretexts.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, at the moment when they were grouping themselves round the ram for a last effort, each one holding his breath and stiffening his muscles in order to communicate all his force to the decisive blow, a howl more frightful still than that which had burst forth and expired beneath the beam, rose among them.--*Paris*",
    "Those who did not cry out, those who were still alive, looked.--*Paris*",
    "Two streams of melted lead were falling from the summit of the edifice into the thickest of the rabble.--*Paris*",
    "That sea of men had just sunk down beneath the boiling metal, which had made, at the two points where it fell, two black and smoking holes in the crowd, such as hot water would make in snow.--*Paris*",
    "Dying men, half consumed and groaning with anguish, could be seen writhing there.--*Paris*",
    "Around these two principal streams there were drops of that horrible rain, which scattered over the assailants and entered their skulls like gimlets of fire.--*Paris*",
    "It was a heavy fire which overwhelmed these wretches with a thousand hailstones.--*Paris*",
    "The outcry was heartrending.--*Paris*",
    "They fled pell-mell, hurling the beam upon the bodies, the boldest as well as the most timid, and the parvis was cleared a second time.--*Paris*",
    "All eyes were raised to the top of the church.--*Paris*",
    "They beheld there an extraordinary sight.--*Paris*",
    "On the crest of the highest gallery, higher than the central rose window, there was a great flame rising between the two towers with whirlwinds of sparks, a vast, disordered, and furious flame, a tongue of which was borne into the smoke by the wind, from time to time.--*Paris*",
    "Below that fire, below the gloomy balustrade with its trefoils showing darkly against its glare, two spouts with monster throats were vomiting forth unceasingly that burning rain, whose silvery stream stood out against the shadows of the lower fa?ade.--*Paris*",
    "As they approached the earth, these two jets of liquid lead spread out in sheaves, like water springing from the thousand holes of a watering-pot.--*Paris*",
    "Above the flame, the enormous towers, two sides of each of which were visible in sharp outline, the one wholly black, the other wholly red, seemed still more vast with all the immensity of the shadow which they cast even to the sky.--*Paris*",
    "Their innumerable sculptures of demons and dragons assumed a lugubrious aspect.--*Paris*",
    "The restless light of the flame made them move to the eye.--*Paris*",
    "There were griffins which had the air of laughing, gargoyles which one fancied one heard yelping, salamanders which puffed at the fire, tarasques* which sneezed in the smoke.--*Paris*",
    "And among the monsters thus roused from their sleep of stone by this flame, by this noise, there was one who walked about, and who was seen, from time to time, to pass across the glowing face of the pile, like a bat in front of a candle.--*Paris*",
    "Without doubt, this strange beacon light would awaken far away, the woodcutter of the hills of Bic\u00eatre, terrified to behold the gigantic shadow of the towers of Notre-Dame quivering over his heaths.--*Paris*",
    "A terrified silence ensued among the outcasts, during which nothing was heard, but the cries of alarm of the canons shut up in their cloister, and more uneasy than horses in a burning stable, the furtive sound of windows hastily opened and still more hastily closed, the internal hurly-burly of the houses and of the H?tel-Dieu, the wind in the flame, the last death-rattle of the dying, and the continued crackling of the rain of lead upon the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, the principal vagabonds had retired beneath the porch of the Gondelaurier mansion, and were holding a council of war.--*Paris*",
    "The Duke of Egypt, seated on a stone post, contemplated the phantasmagorical bonfire, glowing at a height of two hundred feet in the air, with religious terror.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin Trouillefou bit his huge fists with rage.--*Paris*",
    "The Bohemian tossed his head.--*Paris*",
    "Andry the Red laughed in an idiotic way: \"Notre-Dame is making work for the hospital,\" said he.--*Paris*",
    "The Duke of Egypt pointed sadly to the two streams of boiling lead which did not cease to streak the black facade, like two long distaffs of phosphorus.--*Paris*",
    "Mathias Hungadi shook his head.--*Paris*",
    "The King of Thunes frowned: \"So much the worse.--*Paris*",
    "There was a brave heart under that ironmongery.--*Paris*",
    "And Master Pierre Gringoire?\"--*Paris*",
    "Clopin stamped his foot.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, Jehan, who was running as fast as his heavy outfit of a Paladin, and a long ladder which trailed on the pavement, would permit, more breathless than an ant harnessed to a blade of grass twenty times longer than itself.--*Paris*",
    "Clopin approached him.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan gazed at him with a malicious, knowing look, and cracked his fingers like castanets.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment he was sublime.--*Paris*",
    "On his head he wore one of those overloaded helmets of the fifteenth century, which frightened the enemy with their fanciful crests.--*Paris*",
    "His bristled with ten iron beaks, so that Jehan could have disputed with Nestor's Homeric vessel the redoubtable title of ~dexeubolos~.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan set out on a run across the Place, dragging his ladder and shouting: \"Follow me, lads!\"--*Paris*",
    "In an instant the ladder was raised, and propped against the balustrade of the lower gallery, above one of the lateral doors.--*Paris*",
    "The throng of vagabonds, uttering loud acclamations, crowded to its foot to ascend.--*Paris*",
    "But Jehan maintained his right, and was the first to set foot on the rungs.--*Paris*",
    "The passage was tolerably long.--*Paris*",
    "The gallery of the kings of France is to-day about sixty feet above the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "The eleven steps of the flight before the door, made it still higher.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan mounted slowly, a good deal incommoded by his heavy armor, holding his crossbow in one hand, and clinging to a rung with the other.--*Paris*",
    "When he reached the middle of the ladder, he cast a melancholy glance at the poor dead outcasts, with which the steps were strewn.--*Paris*",
    "The scholar finally reached the balcony of the gallery, and climbed over it nimbly, to the applause of the whole vagabond tribe.--*Paris*",
    "Thus master of the citadel, he uttered a shout of joy, and suddenly halted, petrified.--*Paris*",
    "He had just caught sight of Quasimodo concealed in the dark, with flashing eye, behind one of the statues of the kings.--*Paris*",
    "Before a second assailant could gain a foothold on the gallery, the formidable hunchback leaped to the head of the ladder, without uttering a word, seized the ends of the two uprights with his powerful hands, raised them, pushed them out from the wall, balanced the long and pliant ladder, loaded with vagabonds from top to bottom for a moment, in the midst of shrieks of anguish, then suddenly, with superhuman force, hurled this cluster of men backward into the Place.--*Paris*",
    "There was a moment when even the most resolute trembled.--*Paris*",
    "The ladder, launched backwards, remained erect and standing for an instant, and seemed to hesitate, then wavered, then suddenly, describing a frightful arc of a circle eighty feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians, more rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break.--*Paris*",
    "There arose an immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches were seen, crawling over the heap of dead.--*Paris*",
    "A sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among the besiegers.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the balustrade, looked on.--*Paris*",
    "He had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at his window.--*Paris*",
    "As for Jehan Frollo, he was in a critical position.--*Paris*",
    "He found himself in the gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high.--*Paris*",
    "While Quasimodo was dealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the postern which he believed to be open.--*Paris*",
    "It was not.--*Paris*",
    "The deaf man had closed it behind him when he entered the gallery.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan had then concealed himself behind a stone king, not daring to breathe, and fixing upon the monstrous hunchback a frightened gaze, like the man, who, when courting the wife of the guardian of a menagerie, went one evening to a love rendezvous, mistook the wall which he was to climb, and suddenly found himself face to face with a white bear.--*Paris*",
    "For the first few moments, the deaf man paid no heed to him; but at last he turned his head, and suddenly straightened up.--*Paris*",
    "He had just caught sight of the scholar.--*Paris*",
    "Jehan prepared himself for a rough shock, but the deaf man remained motionless; only he had turned towards the scholar and was looking at him.--*Paris*",
    "As he spoke thus, the young scamp stealthily adjusted his crossbow.--*Paris*",
    "The shot sped.--*Paris*",
    "The feathered vireton* whizzed and entered the hunchback's left arm.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo appeared no more moved by it than by a scratch to King Pharamond.--*Paris*",
    "He laid his hand on the arrow, tore it from his arm, and tranquilly broke it across his big knee; then he let the two pieces drop on the floor, rather than threw them down.--*Paris*",
    "But Jehan had no opportunity to fire a second time.--*Paris*",
    "The arrow broken, Quasimodo breathing heavily, bounded like a grasshopper, and he fell upon the scholar, whose armor was flattened against the wall by the blow.--*Paris*",
    "Then in that gloom, wherein wavered the light of the torches, a terrible thing was seen.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had grasped with his left hand the two arms of Jehan, who did not offer any resistance, so thoroughly did he feel that he was lost.--*Paris*",
    "With his right hand, the deaf man detached one by one, in silence, with sinister slowness, all the pieces of his armor, the sword, the daggers, the helmet, the cuirass, the leg pieces.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that it was a monkey taking the shell from a nut.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo flung the scholar's iron shell at his feet, piece by piece.--*Paris*",
    "When the scholar beheld himself disarmed, stripped, weak, and naked in those terrible hands, he made no attempt to speak to the deaf man, but began to laugh audaciously in his face, and to sing with his intrepid heedlessness of a child of sixteen, the then popular ditty:---*Paris*",
    "He did not finish.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was seen on the parapet of the gallery, holding the scholar by the feet with one hand and whirling him over the abyss like a sling; then a sound like that of a bony structure in contact with a wall was heard, and something was seen to fall which halted a third of the way down in its fall, on a projection in the architecture.--*Paris*",
    "It was a dead body which remained hanging there, bent double, its loins broken, its skull empty.--*Paris*",
    "A cry of horror rose among the vagabonds.--*Paris*",
    "There came a tremendous howl, in which were mingled all tongues, all dialects, all accents.--*Paris*",
    "The death of the poor scholar imparted a furious ardor to that crowd.--*Paris*",
    "It was seized with shame, and the wrath of having been held so long in check before a church by a hunchback.--*Paris*",
    "Rage found ladders, multiplied the torches, and, at the expiration of a few minutes, Quasimodo, in despair, beheld that terrible ant heap mount on all sides to the assault of Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Those who had no ladders had knotted ropes; those who had no ropes climbed by the projections of the carvings.--*Paris*",
    "They hung from each other's rags.--*Paris*",
    "There were no means of resisting that rising tide of frightful faces; rage made these fierce countenances ruddy; their clayey brows were dripping with sweat; their eyes darted lightnings; all these grimaces, all these horrors laid siege to Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that some other church had despatched to the assault of Notre-Dame its gorgons, its dogs, its dr\u00e9es, its demons, its most fantastic sculptures.--*Paris*",
    "It was like a layer of living monsters on the stone monsters of the fa?ade.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the Place was studded with a thousand torches.--*Paris*",
    "This scene of confusion, till now hid in darkness, was suddenly flooded with light.--*Paris*",
    "The parvis was resplendent, and cast a radiance on the sky; the bonfire lighted on the lofty platform was still burning, and illuminated the city far away.--*Paris*",
    "The enormous silhouette of the two towers, projected afar on the roofs of Paris, and formed a large notch of black in this light.--*Paris*",
    "The city seemed to be aroused.--*Paris*",
    "Alarm bells wailed in the distance.--*Paris*",
    "The vagabonds howled, panted, swore, climbed; and Quasimodo, powerless against so many enemies, shuddering for the gypsy, beholding the furious faces approaching ever nearer and nearer to his gallery, entreated heaven for a miracle, and wrung his arms in despair.--*Paris*",
    "Book 10 Chapter 5 The Retreat In Which Mosieur Louis Of Franc--*Paris*",
    "The reader has not, perhaps, forgotten that one moment before catching sight of the nocturnal band of vagabonds, Quasimodo, as he inspected Paris from the heights of his bell tower, perceived only one light burning, which gleamed like a star from a window on the topmost story of a lofty edifice beside the Porte Saint-Antoine.--*Paris*",
    "This edifice was the Bastille.--*Paris*",
    "That star was the candle of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "King Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "had, in fact, been two days in Paris.--*Paris*",
    "He was to take his departure on the next day but one for his citadel of Montilz-les-Tours.--*Paris*",
    "He made but seldom and brief appearance in his good city of Paris, since there he did not feel about him enough pitfalls, gibbets, and Scotch archers.--*Paris*",
    "He had come, that day, to sleep at the Bastille.--*Paris*",
    "The great chamber five toises* square, which he had at the Louvre, with its huge chimney-piece loaded with twelve great beasts and thirteen great prophets, and his grand bed, eleven feet by twelve, pleased him but little.--*Paris*",
    "He felt himself lost amid all this grandeur.--*Paris*",
    "This good bourgeois king preferred the Bastille with a tiny chamber and couch.--*Paris*",
    "And then, the Bastille was stronger than the Louvre.--*Paris*",
    "This little chamber, which the king reserved for himself in the famous state prison, was also tolerably spacious and occupied the topmost story of a turret rising from the donjon keep.--*Paris*",
    "It was circular in form, carpeted with mats of shining straw, ceiled with beams, enriched with fleurs-de-lis of gilded metal with interjoists in color; wainscoated with rich woods sown with rosettes of white metal, and with others painted a fine, bright green, made of orpiment and fine indigo.--*Paris*",
    "There was only one window, a long pointed casement, latticed with brass wire and bars of iron, further darkened by fine colored panes with the arms of the king and of the queen, each pane being worth two and twenty sols.--*Paris*",
    "There was but one entrance, a modern door, with a fiat arch, garnished with a piece of tapestry on the inside, and on the outside by one of those porches of Irish wood, frail edifices of cabinet-work curiously wrought, numbers of which were still to be seen in old houses a hundred and fifty years ago.--*Paris*",
    "In this chamber, nothing was to be found of what furnishes ordinary apartments, neither benches, nor trestles, nor forms, nor common stools in the form of a chest, nor fine stools sustained by pillars and counter-pillars, at four sols a piece.--*Paris*",
    "Only one easy arm-chair, very magnificent, was to be seen; the wood was painted with roses on a red ground, the seat was of ruby Cordovan leather, ornamented with long silken fringes, and studded with a thousand golden nails.--*Paris*",
    "The loneliness of this chair made it apparent that only one person had a right to sit down in this apartment.--*Paris*",
    "Beside the chair, and quite close to the window, there was a table covered with a cloth with a pattern of birds.--*Paris*",
    "On this table stood an inkhorn spotted with ink, some parchments, several pens, and a large goblet of chased silver.--*Paris*",
    "A little further on was a brazier, a praying stool in crimson velvet, relieved with small bosses of gold.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, at the extreme end of the room, a simple bed of scarlet and yellow damask, without either tinsel or lace; having only an ordinary fringe.--*Paris*",
    "This bed, famous for having borne the sleep or the sleeplessness of Louis XI., was still to be seen two hundred years ago, at the house of a councillor of state, where it was seen by old Madame Pilou, celebrated in _Cyrus_ under the name \"Arricidie\" and of \"la Morale Vivante\".--*Paris*",
    "Such was the chamber which was called \"the retreat where Monsieur Louis de France says his prayers.\"--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when we have introduced the reader into it, this retreat was very dark.--*Paris*",
    "The curfew bell had sounded an hour before; night was come, and there was only one flickering wax candle set on the table to light five persons variously grouped in the chamber.--*Paris*",
    "The first on which the light fell was a seigneur superbly clad in breeches and jerkin of scarlet striped with silver, and a loose coat with half sleeves of cloth of gold with black figures.--*Paris*",
    "This splendid costume, on which the light played, seemed glazed with flame on every fold.--*Paris*",
    "The man who wore it had his armorial bearings embroidered on his breast in vivid colors; a chevron accompanied by a deer passant.--*Paris*",
    "The shield was flanked, on the right by an olive branch, on the left by a deer's antlers.--*Paris*",
    "This man wore in his girdle a rich dagger whose hilt, of silver gilt, was chased in the form of a helmet, and surmounted by a count's coronet.--*Paris*",
    "He had a forbidding air, a proud mien, and a head held high.--*Paris*",
    "At the first glance one read arrogance on his visage; at the second, craft.--*Paris*",
    "He was standing bareheaded, a long roll of parchment in his hand, behind the arm-chair in which was seated, his body ungracefully doubled up, his knees crossed, his elbow on the table, a very badly accoutred personage.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader imagine in fact, on the rich seat of Cordova leather, two crooked knees, two thin thighs, poorly clad in black worsted tricot, a body enveloped in a cloak of fustian, with fur trimming of which more leather than hair was visible; lastly, to crown all, a greasy old hat of the worst sort of black cloth, bordered with a circular string of leaden figures.--*Paris*",
    "This, in company with a dirty skull-cap, which hardly allowed a hair to escape, was all that distinguished the seated personage.--*Paris*",
    "He held his head so bent upon his breast, that nothing was to be seen of his face thus thrown into shadow, except the tip of his nose, upon which fell a ray of light, and which must have been long.--*Paris*",
    "From the thinness of his wrinkled hand, one divined that he was an old man.--*Paris*",
    "It was Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "At some distance behind them, two men dressed in garments of Flemish style were conversing, who were not sufficiently lost in the shadow to prevent any one who had been present at the performance of Gringoire's mystery from recognizing in them two of the principal Flemish envoys, Guillaume Rym, the sagacious pensioner of Ghent, and Jacques Coppenole, the popular hosier.--*Paris*",
    "The reader will remember that these men were mixed up in the secret politics of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "Finally, quite at the end of the room, near the door, in the dark, stood, motionless as a statue, a vigorous man with thickset limbs, a military harness, with a surcoat of armorial bearings, whose square face pierced with staring eyes, slit with an immense mouth, his ears concealed by two large screens of flat hair, had something about it both of the dog and the tiger.--*Paris*",
    "All were uncovered except the king.--*Paris*",
    "The gentleman who stood near the king was reading him a sort of long memorial to which his majesty seemed to be listening attentively.--*Paris*",
    "The two Flemings were whispering together.--*Paris*",
    "Rym replied by a negative gesture, accompanied by a discreet smile.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment the king's voice was uplifted.--*Paris*",
    "They held their peace.--*Paris*",
    "As he spoke thus, the old man raised his head.--*Paris*",
    "The golden shells of the collar of Saint-Michael could be seen gleaming on his neck.--*Paris*",
    "The candle fully illuminated his gaunt and morose profile.--*Paris*",
    "He tore the papers from the other's hand.--*Paris*",
    "So saying, he cast a glance at the silver goblet which gleamed upon the table.--*Paris*",
    "He coughed and continued,----*Paris*",
    "He paused breathless, then resumed energetically,----*Paris*",
    "All remained silent.--*Paris*",
    "This was one of those fits of wrath which are allowed to take their course.--*Paris*",
    "He continued,----*Paris*",
    "Here he smiled, in the consciousness of his power; this softened his bad humor, and he turned towards the Flemings,----*Paris*",
    "He remained in thought for a moment, then added, shaking his aged head,----*Paris*",
    "The person whom he designated by this name, took the papers into his hands again, and began to read aloud,----*Paris*",
    "The king listened in silence.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time be coughed; then he raised the goblet to his lips and drank a draught with a grimace.--*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rym bowed low, while Coppenole, with his surly mien, had the air of one of the bears of which his majesty was speaking.--*Paris*",
    "The king paid no heed.--*Paris*",
    "He had just dipped his lips into the goblet, and he spat out the beverage, saying: \"Foh!--*Paris*",
    "what a disagreeable potion!\"--*Paris*",
    "The man who was reading continued:----*Paris*",
    "Olivier made a mark with his thumb against the article of the \"rascally foot soldier,\" and passed on.--*Paris*",
    "The king interrupted: \"That suffices.--*Paris*",
    "I allow the sum with great good will.--*Paris*",
    "Those are expenses which I do not begrudge.--*Paris*",
    "I have never regretted that money.--*Paris*",
    "Continue.\"--*Paris*",
    "Then he rose, leaned on the arm of his interlocutor, made a sign to the sort of mute who stood before the door to precede him, to the two Flemings to follow him, and quitted the room.--*Paris*",
    "The royal company was recruited, at the door of the retreat, by men of arms, all loaded down with iron, and by slender pages bearing flambeaux.--*Paris*",
    "It marched for some time through the interior of the gloomy donjon, pierced with staircases and corridors even in the very thickness of the walls.--*Paris*",
    "The captain of the Bastille marched at their head, and caused the wickets to be opened before the bent and aged king, who coughed as he walked.--*Paris*",
    "At each wicket, all heads were obliged to stoop, except that of the old man bent double with age.--*Paris*",
    "At length, after having passed a final wicket, so loaded with locks that a quarter of an hour was required to open it, they entered a vast and lofty vaulted hall, in the centre of which they could distinguish by the light of the torches, a huge cubic mass of masonry, iron, and wood.--*Paris*",
    "The interior was hollow.--*Paris*",
    "It was one of those famous cages of prisoners of state, which were called \"the little daughters of the king.\"--*Paris*",
    "In its walls there were two or three little windows so closely trellised with stout iron bars; that the glass was not visible.--*Paris*",
    "The door was a large flat slab of stone, as on tombs; the sort of door which serves for entrance only.--*Paris*",
    "Only here, the occupant was alive.--*Paris*",
    "The king began to walk slowly round the little edifice, examining it carefully, while Master Olivier, who followed him, read aloud the note.--*Paris*",
    "At this oath, which was the favorite of Louis XI., some one seemed to awaken in the interior of the cage; the sound of chains was heard, grating on the floor, and a feeble voice, which seemed to issue from the tomb was uplifted.--*Paris*",
    "The lamentable voice which had proceeded from the cage had frozen all present, even Master Olivier himself.--*Paris*",
    "The king alone wore the air of not having heard.--*Paris*",
    "At his order, Master Olivier resumed his reading, and his majesty coldly continued his inspection of the cage.--*Paris*",
    "The voice began to moan again.--*Paris*",
    "The voice also continued.--*Paris*",
    "He tore the book from Master Olivier's hands, and set to reckoning it himself upon his fingers, examining the paper and the cage alternately.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the prisoner could be heard sobbing.--*Paris*",
    "This was lugubrious in the darkness, and their faces turned pale as they looked at each other.--*Paris*",
    "He turned his back on the cage, and set out to leave the room.--*Paris*",
    "The miserable prisoner divined from the removal of the torches and the noise, that the king was taking his departure.--*Paris*",
    "The door closed again.--*Paris*",
    "He no longer saw anything, and heard only the hoarse voice of the turnkey, singing in his ears this ditty,----*Paris*",
    "The king reascended in silence to his retreat, and his suite followed him, terrified by the last groans of the condemned man.--*Paris*",
    "All at once his majesty turned to the Governor of the Bastille,----*Paris*",
    "The king knew this better than any one else.--*Paris*",
    "But it was a mania of his.--*Paris*",
    "At the expiration of a few moments, the door of the retreat had opened again, then closed upon the five personages whom the reader has seen at the beginning of this chapter, and who resumed their places, their whispered conversations, and their attitudes.--*Paris*",
    "During the king's absence, several despatches had been placed on his table, and he broke the seals himself.--*Paris*",
    "Then he began to read them promptly, one after the other, made a sign to Master Olivier who appeared to exercise the office of minister, to take a pen, and without communicating to him the contents of the despatches, he began to dictate in a low voice, the replies which the latter wrote, on his knees, in an inconvenient attitude before the table.--*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rym was on the watch.--*Paris*",
    "The king spoke so low that the Flemings heard nothing of his dictation, except some isolated and rather unintelligible scraps, such as,----*Paris*",
    "Once he raised his voice,----*Paris*",
    "Again,----*Paris*",
    "This time Coppenole bowed in company with Guillaume Rym.--*Paris*",
    "The hosier's patriotism was tickled.--*Paris*",
    "The last despatch made Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "frown.--*Paris*",
    "He dictated this letter aloud, in a firm tone, and in jerks.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when he finished it, the door opened and gave passage to a new personage, who precipitated himself into the chamber, crying in affright,----*Paris*",
    "The king, who had risen, grasped him roughly by the arm, and said in his ear, in such a manner as to be heard by him alone, with concentrated rage and a sidelong glance at the Flemings,----*Paris*",
    "The new comer understood, and began in a low tone to give a very terrified account, to which the king listened calmly, while Guillaume Rym called Coppenole's attention to the face and dress of the new arrival, to his furred cowl, (~caputia fourrata~), his short cape, (~epitogia curta~), his robe of black velvet, which bespoke a president of the court of accounts.--*Paris*",
    "Hardly had this personage given the king some explanations, when Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "exclaimed, bursting into a laugh,----*Paris*",
    "Gossip Coictier was struck dumb with surprise.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "continued: \"Where did the watch meet the rabble?\"--*Paris*",
    "He rubbed his hands, he laughed with that inward mirth which makes the countenance beam; he was unable to dissimulate his joy, although he endeavored at moments to compose himself.--*Paris*",
    "No one understood it in the least, not even Master Olivier.--*Paris*",
    "He remained silent for a moment, with a thoughtful but contented air.--*Paris*",
    "The king could not refrain from saying: \"Good!\"--*Paris*",
    "he went on,----*Paris*",
    "The king did not appear in the least disturbed by this list.--*Paris*",
    "Jacques considered it his duty to add,----*Paris*",
    "Gossip Jacques exclaimed, \"Instantly, sire!--*Paris*",
    "there will be time to sack the bailiwick a score of times, to violate the seignory, to hang the bailiff.--*Paris*",
    "For God's sake, sire!--*Paris*",
    "send before to-morrow morning.\"--*Paris*",
    "The king looked him full in the face.--*Paris*",
    "It was one Of those looks to which one does not reply.--*Paris*",
    "After a silence, Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "raised his voice once more,----*Paris*",
    "He corrected himself.--*Paris*",
    "This time he did not correct himself.--*Paris*",
    "He continued dreamily, and as though speaking to himself,----*Paris*",
    "All at once he broke out explosively, \"~Pasque-Dieu~!\"--*Paris*",
    "What people are those who claim to be voyers, justiciaries, lords and masters in our domains?--*Paris*",
    "who have their tollgates at the end of every field?--*Paris*",
    "their gallows and their hangman at every cross-road among our people?--*Paris*",
    "So that as the Greek believed that he had as many gods as there were fountains, and the Persian as many as he beheld stars, the Frenchman counts as many kings as he sees gibbets!--*Paris*",
    "Pardieu!--*Paris*",
    "He lifted his cap again, and continued, still dreamily, with the air and accent of a hunter who is cheering on his pack of hounds: \"Good, my people!--*Paris*",
    "bravely done!--*Paris*",
    "break these false lords!--*Paris*",
    "do your duty!--*Paris*",
    "at them!--*Paris*",
    "have at them!--*Paris*",
    "pillage them!--*Paris*",
    "take them!--*Paris*",
    "sack them!....Ah!--*Paris*",
    "you want to be kings, messeigneurs?--*Paris*",
    "On, my people on!\"--*Paris*",
    "Here he interrupted himself abruptly, bit his lips as though to take back his thought which had already half escaped, bent his piercing eyes in turn on each of the five persons who surrounded him, and suddenly grasping his hat with both hands and staring full at it, he said to it: \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "I would burn you if you knew what there was in my head.\"--*Paris*",
    "Then casting about him once more the cautious and uneasy glance of the fox re-entering his hole,----*Paris*",
    "Master Olivier quitted the room and returned a moment later with the two prisoners, surrounded by archers of the guard.--*Paris*",
    "The first had a coarse, idiotic, drunken and astonished face.--*Paris*",
    "He was clothed in rags, and walked with one knee bent and dragging his leg.--*Paris*",
    "The second had a pallid and smiling countenance, with which the reader is already acquainted.--*Paris*",
    "The king surveyed them for a moment without uttering a word, then addressing the first one abruptly,----*Paris*",
    "He had one of those awkwardly shaped heads where intelligence is about as much at its ease as a light beneath an extinguisher.--*Paris*",
    "A soldier pointed out to the king a billhook which he had seized on the person of the vagabond.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan l'Hermite bowed.--*Paris*",
    "He gave an order in a low voice to two archers, who led away the poor vagabond.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, the king had approached the second prisoner, who was perspiring in great drops: \"Your name?\"--*Paris*",
    "Tristan l'Hermite advanced and pointing to Gringoire,----*Paris*",
    "This was the first word that he had uttered.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, our philosopher was greener than an olive.--*Paris*",
    "He perceived from the king's cold and indifferent mien that there was no other resource than something very pathetic, and he flung himself at the feet of Louis XI., exclaiming, with gestures of despair:----*Paris*",
    "So saying, the unhappy Gringoire kissed the king's slippers, and Guillaume Rym said to Coppenole in a low tone: \"He doth well to drag himself on the earth.--*Paris*",
    "Kings are like the Jupiter of Crete, they have ears only in their feet.\"--*Paris*",
    "And without troubling himself about the Jupiter of Crete, the hosier replied with a heavy smile, and his eyes fixed on Gringoire: \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "that's it exactly!--*Paris*",
    "I seem to hear Chancellor Hugonet craving mercy of me.\"--*Paris*",
    "When Gringoire paused at last, quite out of breath, he raised his head tremblingly towards the king, who was engaged in scratching a spot on the knee of his breeches with his finger- nail; then his majesty began to drink from the goblet of ptisan.--*Paris*",
    "But he uttered not a word, and this silence tortured Gringoire.--*Paris*",
    "At last the king looked at him.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire fell backwards, quite thunderstruck with joy.--*Paris*",
    "And for fear of a counter order, he rushed towards the door, which Tristan opened for him with a very bad grace.--*Paris*",
    "The soldiers left the room with him, pushing him before them with stout thwacks, which Gringoire bore like a true stoical philosopher.--*Paris*",
    "The king's good humor since the revolt against the bailiff had been announced to him, made itself apparent in every way.--*Paris*",
    "This unwonted clemency was no small sign of it.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan l'Hermite in his corner wore the surly look of a dog who has had a bone snatched away from him.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the king thrummed gayly with his fingers on the arm of his chair, the March of Pont-Audemer.--*Paris*",
    "He was a dissembling prince, but one who understood far better how to hide his troubles than his joys.--*Paris*",
    "These external manifestations of joy at any good news sometimes proceeded to very great lengths thus, on the death, of Charles the Bold, to the point of vowing silver balustrades to Saint Martin of Tours; on his advent to the throne, so far as forgetting to order his father's obsequies.--*Paris*",
    "Coictier took the king's hand, and begun to feel of his pulse with a knowing air.--*Paris*",
    "As he felt the king's pulse, Coictier assumed an air of greater and greater alarm.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "watched him with some anxiety.--*Paris*",
    "Coictier grew visibly more gloomy.--*Paris*",
    "The brave man had no other farm than the king's bad health.--*Paris*",
    "He speculated on it to the best of his ability.--*Paris*",
    "He made Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "put out his tongue, shook his head, made a grimace, and in the very midst of these affectations,----*Paris*",
    "Jacques Coictier bowed low and said,----*Paris*",
    "A burning candle does not attract one gnat alone.--*Paris*",
    "Master Olivier, perceiving the king to be in a liberal mood, and judging the moment to be propitious, approached in his turn.--*Paris*",
    "As he spoke thus, Master Olivier's haughty face quitted its arrogant expression for a lowly one.--*Paris*",
    "It is the only change which ever takes place in a courtier's visage.--*Paris*",
    "The king looked him well in the face and said in a dry tone,--\"I understand.\"--*Paris*",
    "He resumed,--*Paris*",
    "These words, uttered with severity, made Master Olivier's face revert to its insolence.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "far from being irritated by this petulant insult, resumed with some gentleness, \"Stay, I was forgetting that I made you my ambassador to Madame Marie, at Ghent.--*Paris*",
    "Yes, gentlemen,\" added the king turning to the Flemings, \"this man hath been an ambassador.--*Paris*",
    "There, my gossip,\" he pursued, addressing Master Olivier, \"let us not get angry; we are old friends.--*Paris*",
    "Our readers have not, without doubt, waited until the present moment to recognize in Master Olivier that terrible Figaro whom Providence, the great maker of dramas, mingled so artistically in the long and bloody comedy of the reign of Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "We will not here undertake to develop that singular figure.--*Paris*",
    "This barber of the king had three names.--*Paris*",
    "At court he was politely called Olivier le Daim (the Deer); among the people Olivier the Devil.--*Paris*",
    "His real name was Olivier le Mauvais.--*Paris*",
    "Accordingly, Olivier le Mauvais remained motionless, sulking at the king, and glancing askance at Jacques Coictier.--*Paris*",
    "Olivier perceiving that the king had made up his mind to laugh, and that there was no way of even annoying him, went off grumbling to execute his orders.--*Paris*",
    "The king rose, approached the window, and suddenly opening it with extraordinary agitation,----*Paris*",
    "Then turning towards the Flemings: \"Come, look at this, gentlemen.--*Paris*",
    "Is it not a fire which gloweth yonder?\"--*Paris*",
    "The two men of Ghent drew near.--*Paris*",
    "The hosier, in spite of the signs made to him by Guillaume Rym, appeared determined to hold his own against the king.--*Paris*",
    "The other replied indifferently,----*Paris*",
    "Guillaume Rym considered it incumbent on him to intervene,----*Paris*",
    "Then, laying his hand familiarly on Coppenole's shoulder,----*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "gazed at him with his penetrating eye,----*Paris*",
    "Coppenole, with his tranquil and rustic countenance, made the king approach the window.--*Paris*",
    "Louis's face grew sombre and dreamy.--*Paris*",
    "He remained silent for a moment, then he gently patted with his hand the thick wall of the donjon, as one strokes the haunches of a steed.--*Paris*",
    "And turning with an abrupt gesture towards the sturdy Fleming,----*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "returned and seated himself, saying, with a smile,----*Paris*",
    "At that instant Olivier le Daim returned.--*Paris*",
    "He was followed by two pages, who bore the king's toilet articles; but what struck Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "was that he was also accompanied by the provost of Paris and the chevalier of the watch, who appeared to be in consternation.--*Paris*",
    "The spiteful barber also wore an air of consternation, which was one of contentment beneath, however.--*Paris*",
    "It was he who spoke first.--*Paris*",
    "The king turned quickly and grazed the mat on the floor with the feet of his chair,----*Paris*",
    "The aged king rose erect and straight as a young man,----*Paris*",
    "The oath was formidable; Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "had only sworn twice in the course of his life by the cross of Saint-L?.--*Paris*",
    "Olivier opened his mouth to reply.--*Paris*",
    "Olivier knelt down and said coldly,----*Paris*",
    "Then, rendered young by fury, he began to walk up and down with long strides.--*Paris*",
    "He no longer laughed, he was terrible, he went and came; the fox was changed into a hyaena.--*Paris*",
    "He seemed suffocated to such a degree that he could not speak; his lips moved, and his fleshless fists were clenched.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he raised his head, his hollow eye appeared full of light, and his voice burst forth like a clarion: \"Down with them, Tristan!--*Paris*",
    "A heavy hand for these rascals!--*Paris*",
    "Go, Tristan, my friend!--*Paris*",
    "slay!--*Paris*",
    "slay!\"--*Paris*",
    "This eruption having passed, he returned to his seat, and said with cold and concentrated wrath,----*Paris*",
    "Tristan bowed.--*Paris*",
    "He added, after a silence, \"And what shall I do with the sorceress?\"--*Paris*",
    "This question caused the king to meditate.--*Paris*",
    "The king appeared to reflect deeply: then, addressing Tristan l'Hermite, \"Well!--*Paris*",
    "gossip, exterminate the people and hang the sorceress.\"--*Paris*",
    "Here, as though seized with a sudden idea, he flung himself on his knees before his chair, took off his hat, placed it on the seat, and gazing devoutly at one of the leaden amulets which loaded it down, \"Oh!\"--*Paris*",
    "said he, with clasped hands, \"our Lady of Paris, my gracious patroness, pardon me.--*Paris*",
    "I will only do it this once.--*Paris*",
    "This criminal must be punished.--*Paris*",
    "I assure you, madame the virgin, my good mistress, that she is a sorceress who is not worthy of your amiable protection.--*Paris*",
    "You know, madame, that many very pious princes have overstepped the privileges of the churches for the glory of God and the necessities of the State.--*Paris*",
    "Saint Hugues, bishop of England, permitted King Edward to hang a witch in his church.--*Paris*",
    "Saint-Louis of France, my master, transgressed, with the same object, the church of Monsieur Saint-Paul; and Monsieur Alphonse, son of the king of Jerusalem, the very church of the Holy Sepulchre.--*Paris*",
    "Pardon me, then, for this once.--*Paris*",
    "Our Lady of Paris, I will never do so again, and I will give you a fine statue of silver, like the one which I gave last year to Our Lady of Ecouys.--*Paris*",
    "So be it.\"--*Paris*",
    "He made the sign of the cross, rose, donned his hat once more, and said to Tristan,----*Paris*",
    "Tristan l'Hermite bowed and departed.--*Paris*",
    "Then the king, dismissing Rym and Coppenole with a gesture,----*Paris*",
    "Both retired and gained their apartments under the guidance of the captain of the Bastille.--*Paris*",
    "Coppenole said to Guillaume Rym,----*Paris*",
    "Book 10 Chapter 6 Little Sword In Pocket--*Paris*",
    "On emerging from the Bastille, Gringoire descended the Rue Saint-Antoine with the swiftness of a runaway horse.--*Paris*",
    "On arriving at the Baudoyer gate, he walked straight to the stone cross which rose in the middle of that place, as though he were able to distinguish in the darkness the figure of a man clad and cloaked in black, who was seated on the steps of the cross.--*Paris*",

    "Book 10 Chapter 7 Chateaupers To The Rescue--*Paris*",
    "The reader will, perhaps, recall the critical situation in which we left Quasimodo.--*Paris*",
    "The brave deaf man, assailed on all sides, had lost, if not all courage, at least all hope of saving, not himself (he was not thinking of himself), but the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "He ran distractedly along the gallery.--*Paris*",
    "Notre-Dame was on the point of being taken by storm by the outcasts.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, a great galloping of horses filled the neighboring streets, and, with a long file of torches and a thick column of cavaliers, with free reins and lances in rest, these furious sounds debouched on the Place like a hurricane,----*Paris*",
    "The frightened vagabonds wheeled round.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo who did not hear, saw the naked swords, the torches, the irons of the pikes, all that cavalry, at the head of which he recognized Captain Phoebus; he beheld the confusion of the outcasts, the terror of some, the disturbance among the bravest of them, and from this unexpected succor he recovered so much strength, that he hurled from the church the first assailants who were already climbing into the gallery.--*Paris*",
    "It was, in fact, the king's troops who had arrived.--*Paris*",
    "The vagabonds behaved bravely.--*Paris*",
    "They defended themselves like desperate men.--*Paris*",
    "Caught on the flank, by the Rue Saint- Pierre-aux-Boeufs, and in the rear through the Rue du Parvis, driven to bay against Notre-Dame, which they still assailed and Quasimodo defended, at the same time besiegers and besieged, they were in the singular situation in which Comte Henri Harcourt, ~Taurinum obsessor idem et obsessus~, as his epitaph says, found himself later on, at the famous siege of Turin, in 1640, between Prince Thomas of Savoy, whom he was besieging, and the Marquis de Leganez, who was blockading him.--*Paris*",
    "The battle was frightful.--*Paris*",
    "There was a dog's tooth for wolf's flesh, as P. Mathieu says.--*Paris*",
    "The king's cavaliers, in whose midst Phoebus de Chateaupers bore himself valiantly, gave no quarter, and the slash of the sword disposed of those who escaped the thrust of the lance.--*Paris*",
    "The outcasts, badly armed foamed and bit with rage.--*Paris*",
    "Men, women, children, hurled themselves on the cruppers and the breasts of the horses, and hung there like cats, with teeth, finger nails and toe nails.--*Paris*",
    "Others struck the archers' in the face with their torches.--*Paris*",
    "Others thrust iron hooks into the necks of the cavaliers and dragged them down.--*Paris*",
    "They slashed in pieces those who fell.--*Paris*",
    "One was noticed who had a large, glittering scythe, and who, for a long time, mowed the legs of the horses.--*Paris*",
    "He was frightful.--*Paris*",
    "He was singing a ditty, with a nasal intonation, he swung and drew back his scythe incessantly.--*Paris*",
    "At every blow he traced around him a great circle of severed limbs.--*Paris*",
    "He advanced thus into the very thickest of the cavalry, with the tranquil slowness, the lolling of the head and the regular breathing of a harvester attacking a field of wheat.--*Paris*",
    "It was Chopin Trouillefou.--*Paris*",
    "A shot from an arquebus laid him low.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, windows had been opened again.--*Paris*",
    "The neighbors hearing the war cries of the king's troops, had mingled in the affray, and bullets rained upon the outcasts from every story.--*Paris*",
    "The Parvis was filled with a thick smoke, which the musketry streaked with flame.--*Paris*",
    "Through it one could confusedly distinguish the front of Notre-Dame, and the decrepit H?tel-Dieu with some wan invalids gazing down from the heights of its roof all checkered with dormer windows.--*Paris*",
    "At length the vagabonds gave way.--*Paris*",
    "Weariness, the lack of good weapons, the fright of this surprise, the musketry from the windows, the valiant attack of the king's troops, all overwhelmed them.--*Paris*",
    "They forced the line of assailants, and fled in every direction, leaving the Parvis encumbered with dead.--*Paris*",
    "When Quasimodo, who had not ceased to fight for a moment, beheld this rout, he fell on his knees and raised his hands to heaven; then, intoxicated with joy, he ran, he ascended with the swiftness of a bird to that cell, the approaches to which he had so intrepidly defended.--*Paris*",
    "He had but one thought now; it was to kneel before her whom he had just saved for the second time.--*Paris*",
    "When he entered the cell, he found it empty.--*Paris*",
    "Book 11 Chapter 1 The Little Shoe--*Paris*",
    "La Esmeralda was sleeping at the moment when the outcasts assailed the church.--*Paris*",
    "Soon the ever-increasing uproar around the edifice, and the uneasy bleating of her goat which had been awakened, had roused her from her slumbers.--*Paris*",
    "She had sat up, she had listened, she had looked; then, terrified by the light and noise, she had rushed from her cell to see.--*Paris*",
    "The aspect of the Place, the vision which was moving in it, the disorder of that nocturnal assault, that hideous crowd, leaping like a cloud of frogs, half seen in the gloom, the croaking of that hoarse multitude, those few red torches running and crossing each other in the darkness like the meteors which streak the misty surfaces of marshes, this whole scene produced upon her the effect of a mysterious battle between the phantoms of the witches' sabbath and the stone monsters of the church.--*Paris*",
    "Imbued from her very infancy with the superstitions of the Bohemian tribe, her first thought was that she had caught the strange beings peculiar to the night, in their deeds of witchcraft.--*Paris*",
    "Then she ran in terror to cower in her cell, asking of her pallet some less terrible nightmare.--*Paris*",
    "But little by little the first vapors of terror had been dissipated; from the constantly increasing noise, and from many other signs of reality, she felt herself besieged not by spectres, but by human beings.--*Paris*",
    "Then her fear, though it did not increase, changed its character.--*Paris*",
    "She had dreamed of the possibility of a popular mutiny to tear her from her asylum.--*Paris*",
    "The idea of once more recovering life, hope, Phoebus, who was ever present in her future, the extreme helplessness of her condition, flight cut off, no support, her abandonment, her isolation,--these thoughts and a thousand others overwhelmed her.--*Paris*",
    "She fell upon her knees, with her head on her bed, her hands clasped over her head, full of anxiety and tremors, and, although a gypsy, an idolater, and a pagan, she began to entreat with sobs, mercy from the good Christian God, and to pray to our Lady, her hostess.--*Paris*",
    "For even if one believes in nothing, there are moments in life when one is always of the religion of the temple which is nearest at hand.--*Paris*",
    "She remained thus prostrate for a very long time, trembling in truth, more than praying, chilled by the ever-closer breath of that furious multitude, understanding nothing of this outburst, ignorant of what was being plotted, what was being done, what they wanted, but foreseeing a terrible issue.--*Paris*",
    "In the midst of this anguish, she heard some one walking near her.--*Paris*",
    "She turned round.--*Paris*",
    "Two men, one of whom carried a lantern, had just entered her cell.--*Paris*",
    "She uttered a feeble cry.--*Paris*",
    "This name reassured her.--*Paris*",
    "She raised her eyes once more, and recognized the poet in very fact.--*Paris*",
    "But there stood beside him a black figure veiled from head to foot, which struck her by its silence.--*Paris*",
    "The little goat had not, in fact, waited for Gringoire to announce his name.--*Paris*",
    "No sooner had he entered than it rubbed itself gently against his knees, covering the poet with caresses and with white hairs, for it was shedding its hair.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire returned the caresses.--*Paris*",
    "The man in black did not allow him to finish.--*Paris*",
    "He approached Gringoire and shook him roughly by the shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire rose.--*Paris*",
    "She was obliged to content herself with this explanation.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire took her by the hand; his companion picked up the lantern and walked on in front.--*Paris*",
    "Fear stunned the young girl.--*Paris*",
    "She allowed herself to be led away.--*Paris*",
    "The goat followed them, frisking, so joyous at seeing Gringoire again that it made him stumble every moment by thrusting its horns between his legs.--*Paris*",
    "They rapidly descended the staircase of the towers, crossed the church, full of shadows and solitude, and all reverberating with uproar, which formed a frightful contrast, and emerged into the courtyard of the cloister by the red door.--*Paris*",
    "The cloister was deserted; the canons had fled to the bishop's palace in order to pray together; the courtyard was empty, a few frightened lackeys were crouching in dark corners.--*Paris*",
    "They directed their steps towards the door which opened from this court upon the Terrain.--*Paris*",
    "The man in black opened it with a key which he had about him.--*Paris*",
    "Our readers are aware that the Terrain was a tongue of land enclosed by walls on the side of the City and belonging to the chapter of Notre-Dame, which terminated the island on the east, behind the church.--*Paris*",
    "They found this enclosure perfectly deserted.--*Paris*",
    "There was here less tumult in the air.--*Paris*",
    "The roar of the outcasts' assault reached them more confusedly and less clamorously.--*Paris*",
    "The fresh breeze which follows the current of a stream, rustled the leaves of the only tree planted on the point of the Terrain, with a noise that was already perceptible.--*Paris*",
    "But they were still very close to danger.--*Paris*",
    "The nearest edifices to them were the bishop's palace and the church.--*Paris*",
    "It was plainly evident that there was great internal commotion in the bishop's palace.--*Paris*",
    "Its shadowy mass was all furrowed with lights which flitted from window to window; as, when one has just burned paper, there remains a sombre edifice of ashes in which bright sparks run a thousand eccentric courses.--*Paris*",
    "Beside them, the enormous towers of Notre-Dame, thus viewed from behind, with the long nave above which they rise cut out in black against the red and vast light which filled the Parvis, resembled two gigantic andirons of some cyclopean fire-grate.--*Paris*",
    "What was to be seen of Paris on all sides wavered before the eye in a gloom mingled with light.--*Paris*",
    "Rembrandt has such backgrounds to his pictures.--*Paris*",
    "The man with the lantern walked straight to the point of the Terrain.--*Paris*",
    "There, at the very brink of the water, stood the wormeaten remains of a fence of posts latticed with laths, whereon a low vine spread out a few thin branches like the fingers of an outspread hand.--*Paris*",
    "Behind, in the shadow cast by this trellis, a little boat lay concealed.--*Paris*",
    "The man made a sign to Gringoire and his companion to enter.--*Paris*",
    "The goat followed them.--*Paris*",
    "The man was the last to step in.--*Paris*",
    "Then he cut the boat's moorings, pushed it from the shore with a long boat- hook, and, seizing two oars, seated himself in the bow, rowing with all his might towards midstream.--*Paris*",
    "The Seine is very rapid at this point, and he had a good deal of trouble in leaving the point of the island.--*Paris*",
    "Gringoire's first care on entering the boat was to place the goat on his knees.--*Paris*",
    "He took a position in the stern; and the young girl, whom the stranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness, seated herself close to the poet.--*Paris*",
    "When our philosopher felt the boat sway, he clapped his hands and kissed Djali between the horns.--*Paris*",
    "He added with the air of a profound thinker, \"One is indebted sometimes to fortune, sometimes to ruse, for the happy issue of great enterprises.\"--*Paris*",
    "The boat made its way slowly towards the right shore.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl watched the unknown man with secret terror.--*Paris*",
    "He had carefully turned off the light of his dark lantern.--*Paris*",
    "A glimpse could be caught of him in the obscurity, in the bow of the boat, like a spectre.--*Paris*",
    "His cowl, which was still lowered, formed a sort of mask; and every time that he spread his arms, upon which hung large black sleeves, as he rowed, one would have said they were two huge bat's wings.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, he had not yet uttered a word or breathed a syllable.--*Paris*",
    "No other noise was heard in the boat than the splashing of the oars, mingled with the rippling of the water along her sides.--*Paris*",
    "The man in black let the garrulous poet chatter on.--*Paris*",
    "He continued to struggle against the violent and narrow current, which separates the prow of the City and the stem of the island of Notre-Dame, which we call to-day the Isle St. Louis.--*Paris*",
    "The stranger answered not a word.--*Paris*",
    "But he suddenly ceased rowing, his arms fell as though broken, his head sank on his breast, and la Esmeralda heard him sigh convulsively.--*Paris*",
    "She shuddered.--*Paris*",
    "She had heard such sighs before.--*Paris*",
    "The boat, abandoned to itself, floated for several minutes with the stream.--*Paris*",
    "But the man in black finally recovered himself, seized the oars once more and began to row against the current.--*Paris*",
    "He doubled the point of the Isle of Notre Dame, and made for the landing-place of the Port an Foin.--*Paris*",
    "The tumult around Notre-Dame was, in fact, increasing.--*Paris*",
    "They listened.--*Paris*",
    "Cries of victory were heard with tolerable distinctness.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, a hundred torches, the light of which glittered upon the helmets of men at arms, spread over the church at all heights, on the towers, on the galleries, on the flying buttresses.--*Paris*",
    "These torches seemed to be in search of something; and soon distant clamors reached the fugitives distinctly :--\"The gypsy!--*Paris*",
    "the sorceress!--*Paris*",
    "death to the gypsy!\"--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy girl dropped her head upon her hands, and the unknown began to row furiously towards the shore.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile our philosopher reflected.--*Paris*",
    "He clasped the goat in his arms, and gently drew away from the gypsy, who pressed closer and closer to him, as though to the only asylum which remained to her.--*Paris*",
    "It is certain that Gringoire was enduring cruel perplexity.--*Paris*",
    "He was thinking that the goat also, \"according to existing law,\" would be hung if recaptured; which would be a great pity, poor Djali!--*Paris*",
    "that he had thus two condemned creatures attached to him; that his companion asked no better than to take charge of the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "A violent combat began between his thoughts, in which, like the Jupiter of the Iliad, he weighed in turn the gypsy and the goat; and he looked at them alternately with eyes moist with tears, saying between his teeth:--*Paris*",
    "A shock informed them that the boat had reached the land at last.--*Paris*",
    "The uproar still filled the city.--*Paris*",
    "The unknown rose, approached the gypsy, and endeavored to take her arm to assist her to alight.--*Paris*",
    "She repulsed him and clung to the sleeve of Gringoire, who, in his turn, absorbed in the goat, almost repulsed her.--*Paris*",
    "Then she sprang alone from the boat.--*Paris*",
    "She was so troubled that she did not know what she did or whither she was going.--*Paris*",
    "Thus she remained for a moment, stunned, watching the water flow past; when she gradually returned to her senses, she found herself alone on the wharf with the unknown.--*Paris*",
    "It appears that Gringoire had taken advantage of the moment of debarcation to slip away with the goat into the block of houses of the Rue Grenier-sur-l'Eau.--*Paris*",
    "The poor gypsy shivered when she beheld herself alone with this man.--*Paris*",
    "She tried to speak, to cry out, to call Gringoire; her tongue was dumb in her mouth, and no sound left her lips.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she felt the stranger's hand on hers.--*Paris*",
    "It was a strong, cold hand.--*Paris*",
    "Her teeth chattered, she turned paler than the ray of moonlight which illuminated her.--*Paris*",
    "The man spoke not a word.--*Paris*",
    "He began to ascend towards the Place de Gr\u00e8ve, holding her by the hand.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, she had a vague feeling that destiny is an irresistible force.--*Paris*",
    "She had no more resistance left in her, she allowed herself to be dragged along, running while he walked.--*Paris*",
    "At this spot the quay ascended.--*Paris*",
    "But it seemed to her as though she were descending a slope.--*Paris*",
    "She gazed about her on all sides.--*Paris*",
    "Not a single passer-by.--*Paris*",
    "The quay was absolutely deserted.--*Paris*",
    "She heard no sound, she felt no people moving save in the tumultuous and glowing city, from which she was separated only by an arm of the Seine, and whence her name reached her, mingled with cries of \"Death!\"--*Paris*",
    "The rest of Paris was spread around her in great blocks of shadows.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the stranger continued to drag her along with the same silence and the same rapidity.--*Paris*",
    "She had no recollection of any of the places where she was walking.--*Paris*",
    "As she passed before a lighted window, she made an effort, drew up suddenly, and cried out, \"Help!\"--*Paris*",
    "The bourgeois who was standing at the window opened it, appeared there in his shirt with his lamp, stared at the quay with a stupid air, uttered some words which she did not understand, and closed his shutter again.--*Paris*",
    "It was her last gleam of hope extinguished.--*Paris*",
    "The man in black did not utter a syllable; he held her firmly, and set out again at a quicker pace.--*Paris*",
    "She no longer resisted, but followed him, completely broken.--*Paris*",
    "From time to time she called together a little strength, and said, in a voice broken by the unevenness of the pavement and the breathlessness of their flight, \"Who are you?--*Paris*",
    "Who are you?\"--*Paris*",
    "He made no reply.--*Paris*",
    "They arrived thus, still keeping along the quay, at a tolerably spacious square.--*Paris*",
    "It was the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "In the middle, a sort of black, erect cross was visible; it was the gallows.--*Paris*",
    "She recognized all this, and saw where she was.--*Paris*",
    "The man halted, turned towards her and raised his cowl.--*Paris*",
    "It was the priest.--*Paris*",
    "He looked like the ghost of himself; that is an effect of the moonlight, it seems as though one beheld only the spectres of things in that light.--*Paris*",
    "Then, like a body which recovers its centre of gravity, he became motionless once more, but his words betrayed no less agitation.--*Paris*",
    "His voice grew lower and lower.--*Paris*",
    "He extended his arm toward the City.--*Paris*",
    "The search seemed, in fact, to be still in progress there.--*Paris*",
    "The uproar drew nearer; the tower of the lieutenant's house, situated opposite the Gr\u00e8ve, was full of clamors and light, and soldiers could be seen running on the opposite quay with torches and these cries, \"The gypsy!--*Paris*",
    "Where is the gypsy!--*Paris*",
    "Death!--*Paris*",
    "Death!\"--*Paris*",
    "He broke off violently.--*Paris*",
    "As he went with hurried step and made her hurry also, for he did not release her, he walked straight to the gallows, and pointed to it with his finger,----*Paris*",
    "She tore herself from his hands and fell at the foot of the gibbet, embracing that funereal support, then she half turned her beautiful head, and looked at the priest over her shoulder.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that she was a Holy Virgin at the foot of the cross.--*Paris*",
    "The priest remained motionless, his finger still raised toward the gibbet, preserving his attitude like a statue.--*Paris*",
    "At length the gypsy said to him,----*Paris*",
    "Then he allowed his arm to sink slowly, and gazed at the pavement in profound dejection.--*Paris*",
    "He went on.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl, kneeling before the gallows, enveloped in her long flowing hair, let him speak on without interruption.--*Paris*",
    "He now had a gentle and plaintive accent which contrasted sadly with the haughty harshness of his features.--*Paris*",
    "He hid his face in his hands.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl heard him weeping.--*Paris*",
    "It was for the first time.--*Paris*",
    "Thus erect and shaken by sobs, he was more miserable and more suppliant than when on his knees.--*Paris*",
    "He wept thus for a considerable time.--*Paris*",
    "As he uttered these last words, his air became utterly distracted.--*Paris*",
    "He was silent for a moment, and resumed, as though speaking to himself, and in a strong voice,----*Paris*",
    "There was another silence, and he went on----*Paris*",
    "His eye was wild.--*Paris*",
    "His voice grew ever weaker; he repeated many times, yet, mechanically, at tolerably long intervals, like a bell prolonging its last vibration: \"Because of her.--Because of her.\"--*Paris*",
    "Then his tongue no longer articulated any perceptible sound; but his lips still moved.--*Paris*",
    "All at once he sank together, like something crumbling, and lay motionless on the earth, with his head on his knees.--*Paris*",
    "A touch from the young girl, as she drew her foot from under him, brought him to himself.--*Paris*",
    "He passed his hand slowly over his hollow cheeks, and gazed for several moments at his fingers, which were wet, \"What!\"--*Paris*",
    "he murmured, \"I have wept!\"--*Paris*",
    "And turning suddenly to the gypsy with unspeakable anguish,----*Paris*",
    "She opened her mouth to answer him.--*Paris*",
    "He flung himself on his knees to receive with adoration the word, possibly a tender one, which was on the point of issuing from her lips.--*Paris*",
    "She said to him, \"You are an assassin!\"--*Paris*",
    "The priest clasped her in his arms with fury, and began to laugh with an abominable laugh.--*Paris*",
    "His eyes sparkled with impurity and rage.--*Paris*",
    "His lewd lips reddened the young girl's neck.--*Paris*",
    "She struggled in his arms.--*Paris*",
    "He covered her with furious kisses.--*Paris*",
    "He reddened, turned pale, then released her and gazed at her with a gloomy air.--*Paris*",
    "She thought herself victorious, and continued,----*Paris*",
    "whom I love, that 'tis Phoebus who is handsome!--*Paris*",
    "you are old, priest!--*Paris*",
    "you are ugly!--*Paris*",
    "Begone!\"--*Paris*",
    "He gave vent to a horrible cry, like the wretch to whom a hot iron is applied.--*Paris*",
    "On arriving there, he turned to her,----*Paris*",
    "She replied with emphasis,----*Paris*",
    "Then he cried in a loud voice,----*Paris*",
    "The young girl felt herself seized suddenly by the elbow.--*Paris*",
    "She looked.--*Paris*",
    "A fleshless arm was stretched from an opening in the wall, and held her like a hand of iron.--*Paris*",
    "A guttural laugh replied from the interior of the wall to these bloody words--\"Hah!--*Paris*",
    "hah!--*Paris*",
    "hah!\"--*Paris*",
    "The young girl had recognized the spiteful recluse.--*Paris*",
    "Panting with terror, she tried to disengage herself.--*Paris*",
    "She writhed, she made many starts of agony and despair, but the other held her with incredible strength.--*Paris*",
    "The lean and bony fingers which bruised her, clenched on her flesh and met around it.--*Paris*",
    "One would have said that this hand was riveted to her arm.--*Paris*",
    "It was more than a chain, more than a fetter, more than a ring of iron, it was a living pair of pincers endowed with intelligence, which emerged from the wall.--*Paris*",
    "She fell back against the wall exhausted, and then the fear of death took possession of her.--*Paris*",
    "She thought of the beauty of life, of youth, of the view of heaven, the aspects of nature, of her love for Phoebus, of all that was vanishing and all that was approaching, of the priest who was denouncing her, of the headsman who was to come, of the gallows which was there.--*Paris*",
    "Then she felt terror mount to the very roots of her hair and she heard the mocking laugh of the recluse, saying to her in a very low tone: \"Hah!--*Paris*",
    "hah!--*Paris*",
    "hah!--*Paris*",
    "you are going to be hanged!\"--*Paris*",
    "She turned a dying look towards the window, and she beheld the fierce face of the sacked nun through the bars.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse did not reply, but began to mumble with a singsong irritated, mocking intonation: \"Daughter of Egypt!--*Paris*",
    "daughter of Egypt!--*Paris*",
    "daughter of Egypt!\"--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy Esmeralda dropped her head beneath her flowing hair, comprehending that it was no human being she had to deal with.--*Paris*",
    "All at once the recluse exclaimed, as though the gypsy's question had taken all this time to reach her brain,--\"'What have you done to me?'--*Paris*",
    "you say!--*Paris*",
    "Ah!--*Paris*",
    "what have you done to me, gypsy!--*Paris*",
    "Well!--*Paris*",
    "listen.--I had a child!--*Paris*",
    "you see!--*Paris*",
    "I had a child!--*Paris*",
    "a child, I tell you!--a pretty little girl!--my Agnes!\"--*Paris*",
    "she went on wildly, kissing something in the dark.--\"Well!--*Paris*",
    "do you see, daughter of Egypt?--*Paris*",
    "they took my child from me; they stole my child; they ate my child.--*Paris*",
    "That is what you have done to me.\"--*Paris*",
    "The young girl replied like a lamb,----*Paris*",
    "Then she began to laugh or to gnash her teeth, for the two things resembled each other in that furious face.--*Paris*",
    "The day was beginning to dawn.--*Paris*",
    "An ashy gleam dimly lighted this scene, and the gallows grew more and more distinct in the square.--*Paris*",
    "On the other side, in the direction of the bridge of Notre-Dame, the poor condemned girl fancied that she heard the sound of cavalry approaching.--*Paris*",
    "Again the young girl fell; exhausted, broken, and having already the glassy eye of a person in the grave.--*Paris*",
    "As she spoke thus, with her other arm extended through the window, she showed the gypsy the little embroidered shoe.--*Paris*",
    "It was already light enough to distinguish its shape and its colors.--*Paris*",
    "And at the same time, with her hand which was at liberty, she quickly opened the little bag ornamented with green glass, which she wore about her neck.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, she stopped short, trembled in every limb, and cried in a voice which proceeded from the very depths of her being: \"My daughter!\"--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy had just drawn from the bag a little shoe absolutely similar to the other.--*Paris*",
    "To this little shoe was attached a parchment on which was inscribed this charm,----*Paris*",
    "Quicker than a flash of lightning, the recluse had laid the two shoes together, had read the parchment and had put close to the bars of the window her face beaming with celestial joy as she cried,----*Paris*",
    "Here we are unequal to the task of depicting the scene.--*Paris*",
    "The wall and the iron bars were between them.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl passed her arm through the opening; the recluse threw herself on that hand, pressed her lips to it and there remained, buried in that kiss, giving no other sign of life than a sob which heaved her breast from time to time.--*Paris*",
    "In the meanwhile, she wept in torrents, in silence, in the dark, like a rain at night.--*Paris*",
    "The poor mother poured out in floods upon that adored hand the dark and deep well of tears, which lay within her, and into which her grief had filtered, drop by drop, for fifteen years.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she rose, flung aside her long gray hair from her brow, and without uttering a word, began to shake the bars of her cage cell, with both hands, more furiously than a lioness.--*Paris*",
    "The bars held firm.--*Paris*",
    "Then she went to seek in the corner of her cell a huge paving stone, which served her as a pillow, and launched it against them with such violence that one of the bars broke, emitting thousands of sparks.--*Paris*",
    "A second blow completely shattered the old iron cross which barricaded the window.--*Paris*",
    "Then with her two hands, she finished breaking and removing the rusted stumps of the bars.--*Paris*",
    "There are moments when woman's hands possess superhuman strength.--*Paris*",
    "A passage broken, less than a minute was required for her to seize her daughter by the middle of her body, and draw her into her cell.--*Paris*",
    "When her daughter was inside the cell, she laid her gently on the ground, then raised her up again, and bearing her in her arms as though she were still only her little Agnes, she walked to and fro in her little room, intoxicated, frantic, joyous, crying out, singing, kissing her daughter, talking to her, bursting into laughter, melting into tears, all at once and with vehemence.--*Paris*",
    "She addressed to her a thousand other extravagant remarks, whose accent constituted their sole beauty, disarranged the poor girl's garments even to the point of making her blush, smoothed her silky hair with her hand, kissed her foot, her knee, her brow, her eyes, was in raptures over everything.--*Paris*",
    "The young girl let her have her way, repeating at intervals and very low and with infinite tenderness, \"My mother!\"--*Paris*",
    "The sacked nun again pressed her daughter in her arms.--*Paris*",
    "And then she began to clap her hands again and to laugh and to cry out: \"We are going to be so happy!\"--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the cell resounded with the clang of arms and a galloping of horses which seemed to be coming from the Pont Notre-Dame, amid advancing farther and farther along the quay.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy threw herself with anguish into the arms of the sacked nun.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse remained for several moments motionless and petrified, then she moved her head in sign of doubt, and suddenly giving vent to a burst of laughter, but with that terrible laugh which had come back to her,----*Paris*",
    "Here the cavalcade appeared to halt, and a voice was heard to say in the distance,----*Paris*",
    "The recluse sprang to her feet with a shriek of despair.--*Paris*",
    "She thrust her head through the window, and withdrew it again hastily.--*Paris*",
    "Her eyes were dry and burning.--*Paris*",
    "She remained silent for a moment; but she paced the cell hurriedly, and halted now and then to pluck out handfuls of her gray hairs, which she afterwards tore with her teeth.--*Paris*",
    "Suddenly she said: \"They draw near.--*Paris*",
    "I will speak with them.--*Paris*",
    "Hide yourself in this corner.--*Paris*",
    "They will not see you.--*Paris*",
    "I will tell them that you have made your escape.--*Paris*",
    "That I released you, i' faith!\"--*Paris*",
    "She set her daughter (down for she was still carrying her), in one corner of the cell which was not visible from without.--*Paris*",
    "She made her crouch down, arranged her carefully so that neither foot nor hand projected from the shadow, untied her black hair which she spread over her white robe to conceal it, placed in front of her her jug and her paving stone, the only articles of furniture which she possessed, imagining that this jug and stone would hide her.--*Paris*",
    "And when this was finished she became more tranquil, and knelt down to pray.--*Paris*",
    "The day, which was only dawning, still left many shadows in the Rat-Hole.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the voice of the priest, that infernal voice, passed very close to the cell, crying,----*Paris*",
    "At that name, at that voice, la Esmeralda, crouching in her corner, made a movement.--*Paris*",
    "She had barely finished when a tumult of men, swords, and horses halted around the cell.--*Paris*",
    "The mother rose quickly and went to post herself before her window, in order to stop it up.--*Paris*",
    "She beheld a large troop of armed men, both horse and foot, drawn up on the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "The commander dismounted, and came toward her.--*Paris*",
    "The poor mother assumed as indifferent an air as she could, and replied,----*Paris*",
    "The other resumed, \"~T\u00eate Dieu~!--*Paris*",
    "What was it that frightened archdeacon said?--*Paris*",
    "Where is he?\"--*Paris*",
    "The recluse did not wish to deny all, for fear of awakening suspicion, and replied in a sincere and surly tone,----*Paris*",
    "The commander made a grimace of disappointment.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan turned his head and made a sign to his troop to prepare to set out on the march again.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse breathed freely once more.--*Paris*",
    "This question brought anguish again to the heart of the miserable mother.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, she did not lose all presence of mind.--*Paris*",
    "They have always been thus,\" she stammered.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan east a sidelong glance at the recluse.--*Paris*",
    "The unfortunate woman felt that all depended on her self- possession, and, although with death in her soul, she began to grin.--*Paris*",
    "Mothers possess such strength.--*Paris*",
    "Always and everywhere people are to be found who have seen everything.--*Paris*",
    "This unexpected testimony from the archer re-encouraged the recluse, whom this interrogatory was forcing to cross an abyss on the edge of a knife.--*Paris*",
    "But she was condemned to a perpetual alternative of hope and alarm.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan tossed his head.--*Paris*",
    "She turned pale.--*Paris*",
    "The poor woman felt her assurance vanishing more and more.--*Paris*",
    "She had reached the point of blundering, and she comprehended with terror that she was saying what she ought not to have said.--*Paris*",
    "Here another soldier came up, crying,----*Paris*",
    "Tristan, whose face became more sinister with every moment, addressed the recluse,----*Paris*",
    "She tried to make head against this new incident,--*Paris*",
    "She seized on these words with avidity.--*Paris*",
    "An old, gray-haired sergeant of the guard stepped out of the ranks, and addressing the provost,----*Paris*",
    "Gudule made an effort and said,----*Paris*",
    "The unanimous testimony of the men of the watch confirmed the old sergeant's words to the provost.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan l'Hermite, in despair at extracting anything from the recluse, turned his back on her, and with unspeakable anxiety she beheld him direct his course slowly towards his horse.--*Paris*",
    "But he still hesitated for some time before mounting his horse.--*Paris*",
    "Gudule palpitated between life and death, as she beheld him cast about the Place that uneasy look of a hunting dog which instinctively feels that the lair of the beast is close to him, and is loath to go away.--*Paris*",
    "At length he shook his head and leaped into his saddle.--*Paris*",
    "Gudule's horribly compressed heart now dilated, and she said in a low voice, as she cast a glance at her daughter, whom she had not ventured to look at while they were there, \"Saved!\"--*Paris*",
    "The poor child had remained all this time in her corner, without breathing, without moving, with the idea of death before her.--*Paris*",
    "She had lost nothing of the scene between Gudule and Tristan, and the anguish of her mother had found its echo in her heart.--*Paris*",
    "She had heard all the successive snappings of the thread by which she hung suspended over the gulf; twenty times she had fancied that she saw it break, and at last she began to breathe again and to feel her foot on firm ground.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment she heard a voice saying to the provost: \"~Corboeuf~!--*Paris*",
    "Monsieur le Prev?t, 'tis no affair of mine, a man of arms, to hang witches.--*Paris*",
    "The rabble of the populace is suppressed.--*Paris*",
    "I leave you to attend to the matter alone.--*Paris*",
    "You will allow me to rejoin my company, who are waiting for their captain.\"--*Paris*",
    "The voice was that of Phoebus de Chateaupers; that which took place within her was ineffable.--*Paris*",
    "He was there, her friend, her protector, her support, her refuge, her Phoebus.--*Paris*",
    "She rose, and before her mother could prevent her, she had rushed to the window, crying,----*Paris*",
    "Phoebus was no longer there.--*Paris*",
    "He had just turned the corner of the Rue de la Coutellerie at a gallop.--*Paris*",
    "But Tristan had not yet taken his departure.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse rushed upon her daughter with a roar of agony.--*Paris*",
    "She dragged her violently back, digging her nails into her neck.--*Paris*",
    "A tigress mother does not stand on trifles.--*Paris*",
    "But it was too late.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan had seen.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan clapped him on the shoulder,----*Paris*",
    "A man who had neither the garments nor the air of a soldier, stepped from the ranks.--*Paris*",
    "He wore a costume half gray, half brown, flat hair, leather sleeves, and carried a bundle of ropes in his huge hand.--*Paris*",
    "This man always attended Tristan, who always attended Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, the recluse had not uttered another word since Tristan had seen her daughter and all hope was lost.--*Paris*",
    "She had flung the poor gypsy, half dead, into the corner of the cellar, and had placed herself once more at the window with both hands resting on the angle of the sill like two claws.--*Paris*",
    "In this attitude she was seen to cast upon all those soldiers her glance which had become wild and frantic once more.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when Rennet Cousin approached her cell, she showed him so savage a face that he shrank back.--*Paris*",
    "Rennet Cousin approached the window again.--*Paris*",
    "The mother's eyes made his own droop.--*Paris*",
    "He said with a good deal of timidity,----*Paris*",
    "She interrupted him in a very low but furious voice,----*Paris*",
    "She began to shake her head, crying,----*Paris*",
    "She said, with a strange sneer,----*Paris*",
    "She repeated with a look of madness,----*Paris*",
    "The executioner observed the mother's finger-nails and dared not.--*Paris*",
    "Rennet returned once more to the provost in great embarrassment.--*Paris*",
    "He had flung his rope on the ground, and was twisting his hat between his hands with an awkward air.--*Paris*",
    "The mother still looked on steadfastly from the depths of her cavern.--*Paris*",
    "She no longer hoped for anything, she no longer knew what she wished, except that she did not wish them to take her daughter.--*Paris*",
    "Rennet Cousin went in search of the chest of tools for the night man, under the shed of the Pillar-House.--*Paris*",
    "He drew from it also the double ladder, which he immediately set up against the gallows.--*Paris*",
    "Five or six of the provost's men armed themselves with picks and crowbars, and Tristan betook himself, in company with them, towards the window.--*Paris*",
    "She looked at him like one who does not understand.--*Paris*",
    "The wretched woman began to laugh in her wild way.--*Paris*",
    "The tone in which she pronounced these words made even Henriet Cousin shudder.--*Paris*",
    "She cried, redoubling her terrible laugh,----*Paris*",
    "In order to make a sufficiently wide opening, it sufficed to dislodge one course of stone below the window.--*Paris*",
    "When the mother heard the picks and crowbars mining her fortress, she uttered a terrible cry; then she began to stride about her cell with frightful swiftness, a wild beasts' habit which her cage had imparted to her.--*Paris*",
    "She no longer said anything, but her eyes flamed.--*Paris*",
    "The soldiers were chilled to the very soul.--*Paris*",
    "All at once she seized her paving stone, laughed, and hurled it with both fists upon the workmen.--*Paris*",
    "The stone, badly flung (for her hands trembled), touched no one, and fell short under the feet of Tristan's horse.--*Paris*",
    "She gnashed her teeth.--*Paris*",
    "In the meantime, although the sun had not yet risen, it was broad daylight; a beautiful rose color enlivened the ancient, decayed chimneys of the Pillar-House.--*Paris*",
    "It was the hour when the earliest windows of the great city open joyously on the roofs.--*Paris*",
    "Some workmen, a few fruit-sellers on their way to the markets on their asses, began to traverse the Gr\u00e8ve; they halted for a moment before this group of soldiers clustered round the Rat-Hole, stared at it with an air of astonishment and passed on.--*Paris*",
    "The recluse had gone and seated herself by her daughter, covering her with her body, in front of her, with staring eyes, listening to the poor child, who did not stir, but who kept murmuring in a low voice, these words only, \"Phoebus!--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus!\"--*Paris*",
    "In proportion as the work of the demolishers seemed to advance, the mother mechanically retreated, and pressed the young girl closer and closer to the wall.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, the recluse beheld the stone (for she was standing guard and never took her eyes from it), move, and she heard Tristan's voice encouraging the workers.--*Paris*",
    "Then she aroused from the depression into which she had fallen during the last few moments, cried out, and as she spoke, her voice now rent the ear like a saw, then stammered as though all kind of maledictions were pressing to her lips to burst forth at once.--*Paris*",
    "Then, addressing Tristan, foaming at the mouth, with wild eyes, all bristling and on all fours like a female panther,----*Paris*",
    "The crowbars raised the heavy course.--*Paris*",
    "It was, as we have said, the mother's last bulwark.--*Paris*",
    "She threw herself upon it, she tried to hold it back; she scratched the stone with her nails, but the massive block, set in movement by six men, escaped her and glided gently to the ground along the iron levers.--*Paris*",
    "The mother, perceiving an entrance effected, fell down in front of the opening, barricading the breach with her body, beating the pavement with her head, and shrieking with a voice rendered so hoarse by fatigue that it was hardly audible,----*Paris*",
    "The mother gazed at the soldiers in such formidable fashion that they were more inclined to retreat than to advance.--*Paris*",
    "No one took a step.--*Paris*",
    "The provost swore,----*Paris*",
    "Placed between the provost and the mother, both threatening, the soldiers hesitated for a moment, then took their resolution, and advanced towards the Rat-Hole.--*Paris*",
    "When the recluse saw this, she rose abruptly on her knees, flung aside her hair from her face, then let her thin flayed hands fall by her side.--*Paris*",
    "Then great tears fell, one by one, from her eyes; they flowed down her cheeks through a furrow, like a torrent through a bed which it has hollowed for itself.--*Paris*",
    "At the same time she began to speak, but in a voice so supplicating, so gentle, so submissive, so heartrending, that more than one old convict-warder around Tristan who must have devoured human flesh wiped his eyes.--*Paris*",
    "We will not try to give an idea of her gestures, her tone, of the tears which she swallowed as she spoke, of the hands which she clasped and then wrung, of the heart-breaking smiles, of the swimming glances, of the groans, the sighs, the miserable and affecting cries which she mingled with her disordered, wild, and incoherent words.--*Paris*",
    "When she became silent Tristan l'Hermite frowned, but it was to conceal a tear which welled up in his tiger's eye.--*Paris*",
    "He conquered this weakness, however, and said in a curt tone,----*Paris*",
    "Then he bent down to the ear of Rennet Cousin, and said to him in a very low tone,----*Paris*",
    "The executioner and the sergeants entered the cell.--*Paris*",
    "The mother offered no resistance, only she dragged herself towards her daughter and threw herself bodily upon her.--*Paris*",
    "The gypsy beheld the soldiers approach.--*Paris*",
    "The horror of death reanimated her,----*Paris*",
    "Rennet Cousin grasped the young girl by the middle of her body, beneath her beautiful shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "When she felt that hand, she cried, \"Heuh!\"--*Paris*",
    "and fainted.--*Paris*",
    "The executioner who was shedding large tears upon her, drop by drop, was about to bear her away in his arms.--*Paris*",
    "He tried to detach the mother, who had, so to speak, knotted her hands around her daughter's waist; but she clung so strongly to her child, that it was impossible to separate them.--*Paris*",
    "Then Rennet Cousin dragged the young girl outside the cell, and the mother after her.--*Paris*",
    "The mother's eyes were also closed.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the sun rose, and there was already on the Place a fairly numerous assembly of people who looked on from a distance at what was being thus dragged along the pavement to the gibbet.--*Paris*",
    "For that was Provost Tristan's way at executions.--*Paris*",
    "He had a passion for preventing the approach of the curious.--*Paris*",
    "There was no one at the windows.--*Paris*",
    "Only at a distance, at the summit of that one of the towers of Notre-Dame which commands the Gr\u00e8ve, two men outlined in black against the light morning sky, and who seemed to be looking on, were visible.--*Paris*",
    "Rennet Cousin paused at the foot of the fatal ladder, with that which he was dragging, and, barely breathing, with so much pity did the thing inspire him, he passed the rope around the lovely neck of the young girl.--*Paris*",
    "The unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp.--*Paris*",
    "She raised her eyelids, and saw the fleshless arm of the stone gallows extended above her head.--*Paris*",
    "Then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud and heartrending voice: \"No!--*Paris*",
    "no!--*Paris*",
    "I will not!\"--*Paris*",
    "Her mother, whose head was buried and concealed in her daughter's garments, said not a word; only her whole body could be seen to quiver, and she was heard to redouble her kisses on her child.--*Paris*",
    "The executioner took advantage of this moment to hastily loose the arms with which she clasped the condemned girl.--*Paris*",
    "Either through exhaustion or despair, she let him have his way.--*Paris*",
    "Then he took the young girl on his shoulder, from which the charming creature hung, gracefully bent over his large head.--*Paris*",
    "Then he set his foot on the ladder in order to ascend.--*Paris*",
    "At that moment, the mother who was crouching on the pavement, opened her eyes wide.--*Paris*",
    "Without uttering a cry, she raised herself erect with a terrible expression; then she flung herself upon the hand of the executioner, like a beast on its prey, and bit it.--*Paris*",
    "It was done like a flash of lightning.--*Paris*",
    "The headsman howled with pain.--*Paris*",
    "Those near by rushed up.--*Paris*",
    "With difficulty they withdrew his bleeding hand from the mother's teeth.--*Paris*",
    "She preserved a profound silence.--*Paris*",
    "They thrust her back with much brutality, and noticed that her head fell heavily on the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "They raised her, she fell back again.--*Paris*",
    "She was dead.--*Paris*",
    "The executioner, who had not loosed his hold on the young girl, began to ascend the ladder once more.--*Paris*",
    "Book 11 Chapter 2 The Beautiful Creature Clad In White--*Paris*",
    "When Quasimodo saw that the cell was empty, that the gypsy was no longer there, that while he had been defending her she had been abducted, he grasped his hair with both hands and stamped with surprise and pain; then he set out to run through the entire church seeking his Bohemian, howling strange cries to all the corners of the walls, strewing his red hair on the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "It was just at the moment when the king's archers were making their victorious entrance into Notre-Dame, also in search of the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, poor, deaf fellow, aided them in their fatal intentions, without suspecting it; he thought that the outcasts were the gypsy's enemies.--*Paris*",
    "He himself conducted Tristan l'Hermite to all possible hiding-places, opened to him the secret doors, the double bottoms of the altars, the rear sacristries.--*Paris*",
    "If the unfortunate girl had still been there, it would have been he himself who would have delivered her up.--*Paris*",
    "When the fatigue of finding nothing had disheartened Tristan, who was not easily discouraged, Quasimodo continued the search alone.--*Paris*",
    "He made the tour of the church twenty times, length and breadth, up and down, ascending and descending, running, calling, sbouting, peeping, rummaging, ransacking, thrusting his head into every hole, pushing a torch under every vault, despairing, mad.--*Paris*",
    "A male who has lost his female is no more roaring nor more haggard.--*Paris*",
    "At last when he was sure, perfectly sure that she was no longer there, that all was at an end, that she had been snatched from him, he slowly mounted the staircase to the towers, that staircase which he had ascended with so much eagerness and triumph on the day when he had saved her.--*Paris*",
    "He passed those same places once more with drooping head, voiceless, tearless, almost breathless.--*Paris*",
    "The church was again deserted, and had fallen back into its silence.--*Paris*",
    "The archers had quitted it to track the sorceress in the city.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, left alone in that vast Notre-Dame, so besieged and tumultuous but a short time before, once more betook himself to the cell where the gypsy had slept for so many weeks under his guardianship.--*Paris*",
    "As he approached it, he fancied that he might, perhaps, find her there.--*Paris*",
    "When, at the turn of the gallery which opens on the roof of the side aisles, he perceived the tiny cell with its little window and its little door crouching beneath a great flying buttress like a bird's nest under a branch, the poor man's heart failed him, and he leaned against a pillar to keep from falling.--*Paris*",
    "He imagined that she might have returned thither, that some good genius had, no doubt, brought her back, that this chamber was too tranquil, too safe, too charming for her not to be there, and he dared not take another step for fear of destroying his illusion.--*Paris*",
    "At length he summoned up courage, advanced on tiptoe, looked, entered.--*Paris*",
    "Empty.--*Paris*",
    "The cell was still empty.--*Paris*",
    "The unhappy deaf man walked slowly round it, lifted the bed and looked beneath it, as though she might be concealed between the pavement and the mattress, then he shook his head and remained stupefied.--*Paris*",
    "All at once, he crushed his torch under his foot, and, without uttering a word, without giving vent to a sigh, he flung himself at full speed, head foremost against the wall, and fell fainting on the floor.--*Paris*",
    "When he recovered his senses, he threw himself on the bed and rolling about, he kissed frantically the place where the young girl had slept and which was still warm; he remained there for several moments as motionless as though he were about to expire; then he rose, dripping with perspiration, panting, mad, and began to beat his head against the wall with the frightful regularity of the clapper of his bells, and the resolution of a man determined to kill himself.--*Paris*",
    "At length he fell a second time, exhausted; he dragged himself on his knees outside the cell, and crouched down facing the door, in an attitude of astonishment.--*Paris*",
    "He remained thus for more than an hour without making a movement, with his eye fixed on the deserted cell, more gloomy, and more pensive than a mother seated between an empty cradle and a full coffin.--*Paris*",
    "He uttered not a word; only at long intervals, a sob heaved his body violently, but it was a tearless sob, like summer lightning which makes no noise.--*Paris*",
    "It appears to have been then, that, seeking at the bottom of his lonely thoughts for the unexpected abductor of the gypsy, he thought of the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "He remembered that Dom Claude alone possessed a key to the staircase leading to the cell; he recalled his nocturnal attempts on the young girl, in the first of which he, Quasimodo, had assisted, the second of which he had prevented.--*Paris*",
    "He recalled a thousand details, and soon he no longer doubted that the archdeacon had taken the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, such was his respect for the priest, such his gratitude, his devotion, his love for this man had taken such deep root in his heart, that they resisted, even at this moment, the talons of jealousy and despair.--*Paris*",
    "He reflected that the archdeacon had done this thing, and the wrath of blood and death which it would have evoked in him against any other person, turned in the poor deaf man, from the moment when Claude Frollo was in question, into an increase of grief and sorrow.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when his thought was thus fixed upon the priest, while the daybreak was whitening the flying buttresses, he perceived on the highest story of Notre-Dame, at the angle formed by the external balustrade as it makes the turn of the chancel, a figure walking.--*Paris*",
    "This figure was coming towards him.--*Paris*",
    "He recognized it.--*Paris*",
    "It was the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "Claude was walking with a slow, grave step.--*Paris*",
    "He did not look before him as he walked, he was directing his course towards the northern tower, but his face was turned aside towards the right bank of the Seine, and he held his head high, as though trying to see something over the roofs.--*Paris*",
    "The owl often assumes this oblique attitude.--*Paris*",
    "It flies towards one point and looks towards another.--*Paris*",
    "In this manner the priest passed above Quasimodo without seeing him.--*Paris*",
    "The deaf man, who had been petrified by this sudden apparition, beheld him disappear through the door of the staircase to the north tower.--*Paris*",
    "The reader is aware that this is the tower from which the H?tel-de-Ville is visible.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo rose and followed the archdeacon.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo ascended the tower staircase for the sake of ascending it, for the sake of seeing why the priest was ascending it.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, the poor bellringer did not know what he (Quasimodo) should do, what he should say, what he wished.--*Paris*",
    "He was full of fury and full of fear.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon and the gypsy had come into conflict in his heart.--*Paris*",
    "When he reached the summit of the tower, before emerging from the shadow of the staircase and stepping upon the platform, he cautiously examined the position of the priest.--*Paris*",
    "The priest's back was turned to him.--*Paris*",
    "There is an openwork balustrade which surrounds the platform of the bell tower.--*Paris*",
    "The priest, whose eyes looked down upon the town, was resting his breast on that one of the four sides of the balustrades which looks upon the Pont Notre-Dame.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo, advancing with the tread of a wolf behind him, went to see what he was gazing at thus.--*Paris*",
    "The priest's attention was so absorbed elsewhere that he did not hear the deaf man walking behind him.--*Paris*",
    "Paris is a magnificent and charming spectacle, and especially at that day, viewed from the top of the towers of Notre- Dame, in the fresh light of a summer dawn.--*Paris*",
    "The day might have been in July.--*Paris*",
    "The sky was perfectly serene.--*Paris*",
    "Some tardy stars were fading away at various points, and there was a very brilliant one in the east, in the brightest part of the heavens.--*Paris*",
    "The sun was about to appear; Paris was beginning to move.--*Paris*",
    "A very white and very pure light brought out vividly to the eye all the outlines that its thousands of houses present to the east.--*Paris*",
    "The giant shadow of the towers leaped from roof to roof, from one end of the great city to the other.--*Paris*",
    "There were several quarters from which were already heard voices and noisy sounds.--*Paris*",
    "Here the stroke of a bell, there the stroke of a hammer, beyond, the complicated clatter of a cart in motion.--*Paris*",
    "Already several columns of smoke were being belched forth from the chimneys scattered over the whole surface of roofs, as through the fissures of an immense sulphurous crater.--*Paris*",
    "The river, which ruffles its waters against the arches of so many bridges, against the points of so many islands, was wavering with silvery folds.--*Paris*",
    "Around the city, outside the ramparts, sight was lost in a great circle of fleecy vapors through which one confusedly distinguished the indefinite line of the plains, and the graceful swell of the heights.--*Paris*",
    "All sorts of floating sounds were dispersed over this half-awakened city.--*Paris*",
    "Towards the east, the morning breeze chased a few soft white bits of wool torn from the misty fleece of the hills.--*Paris*",
    "In the Parvis, some good women, who had their milk jugs in their hands, were pointing out to each other, with astonishment, the singular dilapidation of the great door of Notre-Dame, and the two solidified streams of lead in the crevices of the stone.--*Paris*",
    "This was all that remained of the tempest of the night.--*Paris*",
    "The bonfire lighted between the towers by Quasimodo had died out.--*Paris*",
    "Tristan had already cleared up the Place, and had the dead thrown into the Seine.--*Paris*",
    "Kings like Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "are careful to clean the pavement quickly after a massacre.--*Paris*",
    "Outside the balustrade of the tower, directly under the point where the priest had paused, there was one of those fantastically carved stone gutters with which Gothic edifices bristle, and, in a crevice of that gutter, two pretty wallflowers in blossom, shaken out and vivified, as it were, by the breath of air, made frolicsome salutations to each other.--*Paris*",
    "Above the towers, on high, far away in the depths of the sky, the cries of little birds were heard.--*Paris*",
    "But the priest was not listening to, was not looking at, anything of all this.--*Paris*",
    "He was one of the men for whom there are no mornings, no birds, no flowers.--*Paris*",
    "In that immense horizon, which assumed so many aspects about him, his contemplation was concentrated on a single point.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo was burning to ask him what he had done with the gypsy; but the archdeacon seemed to be out of the world at that moment.--*Paris*",
    "He was evidently in one of those violent moments of life when one would not feel the earth crumble.--*Paris*",
    "He remained motionless and silent, with his eyes steadily fixed on a certain point; and there was something so terrible about this silence and immobility that the savage bellringer shuddered before it and dared not come in contact with it.--*Paris*",
    "Only, and this was also one way of interrogating the archdeacon, he followed the direction of his vision, and in this way the glance of the unhappy deaf man fell upon the Place de Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "Thus he saw what the priest was looking at.--*Paris*",
    "The ladder was erected near the permanent gallows.--*Paris*",
    "There were some people and many soldiers in the Place.--*Paris*",
    "A man was dragging a white thing, from which hung something black, along the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "This man halted at the foot of the gallows.--*Paris*",
    "Here something took place which Quasimodo could not see very clearly.--*Paris*",
    "It was not because his only eye had not preserved its long range, but there was a group of soldiers which prevented his seeing everything.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, at that moment the sun appeared, and such a flood of light overflowed the horizon that one would have said that all the points in Paris, spires, chimneys, gables, had simultaneously taken fire.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the man began to mount the ladder.--*Paris*",
    "Then Quasimodo saw him again distinctly.--*Paris*",
    "He was carrying a woman on his shoulder, a young girl dressed in white; that young girl had a noose about her neck.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo recognized her.--*Paris*",
    "It was she.--*Paris*",
    "The man reached the top of the ladder.--*Paris*",
    "There he arranged the noose.--*Paris*",
    "Here the priest, in order to see the better, knelt upon the balustrade.--*Paris*",
    "All at once the man kicked away the ladder abruptly, and Quasimodo, who had not breathed for several moments, beheld the unhappy child dangling at the end of the rope two fathoms above the pavement, with the man squatting on her shoulders.--*Paris*",
    "The rope made several gyrations on itself, and Quasimodo beheld horrible convulsions run along the gypsy's body.--*Paris*",
    "The priest, on his side, with outstretched neck and eyes starting from his head, contemplated this horrible group of the man and the young girl,--the spider and the fly.--*Paris*",
    "At the moment when it was most horrible, the laugh of a demon, a laugh which one can only give vent to when one is no longer human, burst forth on the priest's livid face.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo did not hear that laugh, but he saw it.--*Paris*",
    "The bellringer retreated several paces behind the archdeacon, and suddenly hurling himself upon him with fury, with his huge hands he pushed him by the back over into the abyss over which Dom Claude was leaning.--*Paris*",
    "The priest shrieked: \"Damnation!\"--*Paris*",
    "and fell.--*Paris*",
    "The spout, above which he had stood, arrested him in his fall.--*Paris*",
    "He clung to it with desperate hands, and, at the moment when he opened his mouth to utter a second cry, he beheld the formidable and avenging face of Quasimodo thrust over the edge of the balustrade above his head.--*Paris*",
    "Then he was silent.--*Paris*",
    "The abyss was there below him.--*Paris*",
    "A fall of more than two hundred feet and the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "In this terrible situation, the archdeacon said not a word, uttered not a groan.--*Paris*",
    "He merely writhed upon the spout, with incredible efforts to climb up again; but his hands had no hold on the granite, his feet slid along the blackened wall without catching fast.--*Paris*",
    "People who have ascended the towers of Notre-Dame know that there is a swell of the stone immediately beneath the balustrade.--*Paris*",
    "It was on this retreating angle that miserable archdeacon exhausted himself.--*Paris*",
    "He had not to deal with a perpendicular wall, but with one which sloped away beneath him.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo had but to stretch out his hand in order to draw him from the gulf; but he did not even look at him.--*Paris*",
    "He was looking at the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "He was looking at the gallows.--*Paris*",
    "He was looking at the gypsy.--*Paris*",
    "The deaf man was leaning, with his elbows on the balustrade, at the spot where the archdeacon had been a moment before, and there, never detaching his gaze from the only object which existed for him in the world at that moment, he remained motionless and mute, like a man struck by lightning, and a long stream of tears flowed in silence from that eye which, up to that time, had never shed but one tear.--*Paris*",
    "Meanwhile, the archdeacon was panting.--*Paris*",
    "His bald brow was dripping with perspiration, his nails were bleeding against the stones, his knees were flayed by the wall.--*Paris*",
    "He heard his cassock, which was caught on the spout, crack and rip at every jerk that he gave it.--*Paris*",
    "To complete his misfortune, this spout ended in a leaden pipe which bent under the weight of his body.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon felt this pipe slowly--*Paris*",
    "giving way.--*Paris*",
    "The miserable man said to himself that, when his hands should be worn out with fatigue, when his cassock should tear asunder, when the lead should give way, he would be obliged to fall, and terror seized upon his very vitals.--*Paris*",
    "Now and then he glanced wildly at a sort of narrow shelf formed, ten feet lower down, by projections of the sculpture, and he prayed heaven, from the depths of his distressed soul, that he might be allowed to finish his life, were it to last two centuries, on that space two feet square.--*Paris*",
    "Once, he glanced below him into the Place, into the abyss; the head which he raised again had its eyes closed and its hair standing erect.--*Paris*",
    "There was something frightful in the silence of these two men.--*Paris*",
    "While the archdeacon agonized in this terrible fashion a few feet below him, Quasimodo wept and gazed at the Gr\u00e8ve.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon, seeing that all his exertions served only to weaken the fragile support which remained to him, decided to remain quiet.--*Paris*",
    "There he hung, embracing the gutter, hardly breathing, no longer stirring, making no longer any other movements than that mechanical convulsion of the stomach, which one experiences in dreams when one fancies himself falling.--*Paris*",
    "His fixed eyes were wide open with a stare.--*Paris*",
    "He lost ground little by little, nevertheless, his fingers slipped along the spout; he became more and more conscious of the feebleness of his arms and the weight of his body.--*Paris*",
    "The curve of the lead which sustained him inclined more and more each instant towards the abyss.--*Paris*",
    "He beheld below him, a frightful thing, the roof of Saint- Jean le Rond, as small as a card folded in two.--*Paris*",
    "He gazed at the impressive carvings, one by one, of the tower, suspended like himself over the precipice, but without terror for themselves or pity for him.--*Paris*",
    "All was stone around him; before his eyes, gaping monsters; below, quite at the bottom, in the Place, the pavement; above his head, Quasimodo weeping.--*Paris*",
    "In the Parvis there were several groups of curious good people, who were tranquilly seeking to divine who the madman could be who was amusing himself in so strange a manner.--*Paris*",
    "The priest heard them saying, for their voices reached him, clear and shrill: \"Why, he will break his neck!\"--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo wept.--*Paris*",
    "At last the archdeacon, foaming with rage and despair, understood that all was in vain.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he collected all the strength which remained to him for a final effort.--*Paris*",
    "He stiffened himself upon the spout, pushed against the wall with both his knees, clung to a crevice in the stones with his hands, and succeeded in climbing back with one foot, perhaps; but this effort made the leaden beak on which he rested bend abruptly.--*Paris*",
    "His cassock burst open at the same time.--*Paris*",
    "Then, feeling everything give way beneath him, with nothing but his stiffened and failing hands to support him, the unfortunate man closed his eyes and let go of the spout.--*Paris*",
    "He fell.--*Paris*",
    "Quasimodo watched him fall.--*Paris*",
    "A fall from such a height is seldom perpendicular.--*Paris*",
    "The archdeacon, launched into space, fell at first head foremost, with outspread hands; then he whirled over and over many times; the wind blew him upon the roof of a house, where the unfortunate man began to break up.--*Paris*",
    "Nevertheless, he was not dead when he reached there.--*Paris*",
    "The bellringer saw him still endeavor to cling to a gable with his nails; but the surface sloped too much, and he had no more strength.--*Paris*",
    "He slid rapidly along the roof like a loosened tile, and dashed upon the pavement.--*Paris*",
    "There he no longer moved.--*Paris*",
    "Then Quasimodo raised his eyes to the gypsy, whose body he beheld hanging from the gibbet, quivering far away beneath her white robe with the last shudderings of anguish, then he dropped them on the archdeacon, stretched out at the base of the tower, and no longer retaining the human form, and he said, with a sob which heaved his deep chest,-- \"Oh!--*Paris*",
    "all that I have ever loved!\"--*Paris*",
    "Book 11 Chapter 3 The Marriage Of Phoebus--*Paris*",
    "Towards evening on that day, when the judiciary officers of the bishop came to pick up from the pavement of the Parvis the dislocated corpse of the archdeacon, Quasimodo had disappeared.--*Paris*",
    "A great many rumors were in circulation with regard to this adventure.--*Paris*",
    "No one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their compact, Quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off Claude Frollo, that is to say, the sorcerer.--*Paris*",
    "It was presumed that he had broken the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get at the nut.--*Paris*",
    "This is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.--*Paris*",
    "Louis XI.--*Paris*",
    "died a year later, in the month of August, 1483.--*Paris*",
    "As for Pierre Gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won success in tragedy.--*Paris*",
    "It appears that, after having tasted astrology, philosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to tragedy, vainest pursuit of all.--*Paris*",
    "This is what he called \"coming to a tragic end.\"--*Paris*",
    "This is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the \"Ordinary:\" \"To Jehan Marchand and Pierre Gringoire, carpenter and composer, who have made and composed the mystery made at the Ch?telet of Paris, at the entry of Monsieur the Legate, and have ordered the personages, clothed and dressed the same, as in the said mystery was required; and likewise, for having made the scaffoldings thereto necessary; and for this deed,--one hundred livres.\"--*Paris*",
    "Phoebus de Chateaupers also came to a tragic end.--*Paris*",
    "He married.--*Paris*",
    "Book 11 Chapter 4 The Marriage Of Quasimodo--*Paris*",
    "We have just said that Quasimodo disappeared from Notre- Dame on the day of the gypsy's and of the archdeacon's death.--*Paris*",
    "He was not seen again, in fact; no one knew what had become of him.--*Paris*",
    "During the night which followed the execution of la Esmeralda, the night men had detached her body from the gibbet, and had carried it, according to custom, to the cellar of Montfau?on.--*Paris*",
    "Montfau?on was, as Sauval says, \"the most ancient and the most superb gibbet in the kingdom.\"--*Paris*",
    "Between the faubourgs of the Temple and Saint Martin, about a hundred and sixty toises from the walls of Paris, a few bow shots from La Courtille, there was to be seen on the crest of a gentle, almost imperceptible eminence, but sufficiently elevated to be seen for several leagues round about, an edifice of strange form, bearing considerable resemblance to a Celtic cromlech, and where also human sacrifices were offered.--*Paris*",
    "Let the reader picture to himself, crowning a limestone hillock, an oblong mass of masonry fifteen feet in height, thirty wide, forty long, with a gate, an external railing and a platform; on this platform sixteen enormous pillars of rough hewn stone, thirty feet in height, arranged in a colonnade round three of the four sides of the mass which support them, bound together at their summits by heavy beams, whence hung chains at intervals; on all these chains, skeletons; in the vicinity, on the plain, a stone cross and two gibbets of secondary importance, which seemed to have sprung up as shoots around the central gallows; above all this, in the sky, a perpetual flock of crows; that was Montfau?on.--*Paris*",
    "At the end of the fifteenth century, the formidable gibbet which dated from 1328, was already very much dilapidated; the beams were wormeaten, the chains rusted, the pillars green with mould; the layers of hewn stone were all cracked at their joints, and grass was growing on that platform which no feet touched.--*Paris*",
    "The monument made a horrible profile against the sky; especially at night when there was a little moonlight on those white skulls, or when the breeze of evening brushed the chains and the skeletons, and swayed all these in the darkness.--*Paris*",
    "The presence of this gibbet sufficed to render gloomy all the surrounding places.--*Paris*",
    "The mass of masonry which served as foundation to the odious edifice was hollow.--*Paris*",
    "A huge cellar had been constructed there, closed by an old iron grating, which was out of order, into which were cast not only the human remains, which were taken from the chains of Montfau?on, but also the bodies of all the unfortunates executed on the other permanent gibbets of Paris.--*Paris*",
    "To that deep charnel-house, where so many human remains and so many crimes have rotted in company, many great ones of this world, many innocent people, have contributed their bones, from Enguerrand de Marigni, the first victim, and a just man, to Admiral de Coligni, who was its last, and who was also a just man.--*Paris*",
    "As for the mysterious disappearance of Quasimodo, this is all that we have been able to discover.--*Paris*",
    "About eighteen months or two years after the events which terminate this story, when search was made in that cavern for the body of Olivier le Daim, who had been hanged two days previously, and to whom Charles VIII.--*Paris*",
    "had granted the favor of being buried in Saint Laurent, in better company, they found among all those hideous carcasses two skeletons, one of which held the other in its embrace.--*Paris*",
    "One of these skeletons, which was that of a woman, still had a few strips of a garment which had once been white, and around her neck was to be seen a string of adr\u00e9zarach beads with a little silk bag ornamented with green glass, which was open and empty.--*Paris*",
    "These objects were of so little value that the executioner had probably not cared for them.--*Paris*",
    "The other, which held this one in a close embrace, was the skeleton of a man.--*Paris*",
    "It was noticed that his spinal column was crooked, his head seated on his shoulder blades, and that one leg was shorter than the other.--*Paris*",
    "Moreover, there was no fracture of the vertebrae at the nape of the neck, and it was evident that he had not been hanged.--*Paris*",
    "Hence, the man to whom it had belonged had come thither and had died there.--*Paris*",
    "When they tried to detach the skeleton which he held in his embrace, he fell to dust.--*Paris*",

    "A Dolphin saw the Monkey--*aesop*",

    "When the Dolphin arrived with--*aesop*",

    "O strangers?\u201d The Lying Traveler replied, \u201cYou seem to me a most mighty--*aesop*",
    "king.\u201d \u201cAnd what is your estimate of those you see around me?\u201d \u201cThese,\u201d--*aesop*",

    "look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of--*aesop*",
    "evil against it; and when occasion called him one day into the city,--*aesop*",
    "he left the sheep entirely in his charge.--*aesop*",
    "The Wolf, now that he had the--*aesop*",
    "opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of--*aesop*",

    "They had--*aesop*",

    "It is--*aesop*",
    "surrounded by too many dangers to please me.--*aesop*",

    "See if I do not prick--*aesop*",
    "your neck with my sting.\u201d The Draught-Mule replied, \u201cI do not heed your--*aesop*",

    "The Birds gave no--*aesop*",

    "Jupiter--*aesop*",

    "one enter the habitations of men.--*aesop*",
    "Hence it arises that Ills abound, for--*aesop*",

    "not know how I got out of the house.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Travelers and the Plane-Tree--*aesop*",
    "TWO TRAVELERS, worn out by the heat of the summer\u2019s sun, laid themselves--*aesop*",
    "down at noon under the widespreading branches of a Plane-Tree.--*aesop*",
    "As they--*aesop*",
    "rested under its shade, one of the Travelers said to the other, \u201cWhat a--*aesop*",
    "singularly useless tree is the Plane!--*aesop*",
    "It bears no fruit, and is not of--*aesop*",
    "the least service to man.\u201d The Plane-Tree, interrupting him, said, \u201cYou--*aesop*",
    "ungrateful fellows!--*aesop*",
    "Do you, while receiving benefits from me and resting--*aesop*",
    "under my shade, dare to describe me as useless, and unprofitable?\u201d--*aesop*",
    "Some men underrate their best blessings.--*aesop*",
    "The Hares and the Frogs--*aesop*",
    "THE HARES, oppressed by their own exceeding timidity and weary of the--*aesop*",
    "perpetual alarm to which they were exposed, with one accord determined--*aesop*",
    "to put an end to themselves and their troubles by jumping from a lofty--*aesop*",
    "precipice into a deep lake below.--*aesop*",
    "As they scampered off in large numbers--*aesop*",
    "to carry out their resolve, the Frogs lying on the banks of the lake--*aesop*",
    "heard the noise of their feet and rushed helter-skelter to the deep--*aesop*",
    "water for safety.--*aesop*",
    "On seeing the rapid disappearance of the Frogs, one of--*aesop*",
    "the Hares cried out to his companions: \u201cStay, my friends, do not do as--*aesop*",
    "you intended; for you now see that there are creatures who are still--*aesop*",
    "more timid than ourselves.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Lion, Jupiter, and the Elephant--*aesop*",
    "THE LION wearied Jupiter with his frequent complaints.--*aesop*",
    "Jupiter!\u201d he said, \u201cthat I am gigantic in strength, handsome in shape,--*aesop*",
    "and powerful in attack.--*aesop*",
    "I have jaws well provided with teeth, and feet--*aesop*",
    "furnished with claws, and I lord it over all the beasts of the forest,--*aesop*",
    "and what a disgrace it is, that being such as I am, I should be--*aesop*",
    "frightened by the crowing of a cock.\u201d Jupiter replied, \u201cWhy do you blame--*aesop*",
    "me without a cause?--*aesop*",
    "I have given you all the attributes which I possess--*aesop*",
    "myself, and your courage never fails you except in this one instance.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "himself with his cowardice, wished that he might die.--*aesop*",
    "As these thoughts--*aesop*",
    "passed through his mind, he met an Elephant and came close to hold a--*aesop*",
    "conversation with him.--*aesop*",
    "After a time he observed that the Elephant shook--*aesop*",
    "his ears very often, and he inquired what was the matter and why his--*aesop*",
    "ears moved with such a tremor every now and then.--*aesop*",
    "Just at that moment--*aesop*",
    "a Gnat settled on the head of the Elephant, and he replied, \u201cDo you see--*aesop*",
    "that little buzzing insect?--*aesop*",
    "If it enters my ear, my fate is sealed.--*aesop*",
    "I--*aesop*",
    "should die presently.\u201d The Lion said, \u201cWell, since so huge a beast is--*aesop*",
    "afraid of a tiny gnat, I will no more complain, nor wish myself dead.--*aesop*",
    "I--*aesop*",
    "find myself, even as I am, better off than the Elephant.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Lamb and the Wolf--*aesop*",
    "A WOLF pursued a Lamb, which fled for refuge to a certain Temple.--*aesop*",
    "The--*aesop*",
    "Wolf called out to him and said, \u201cThe Priest will slay you in sacrifice,--*aesop*",
    "if he should catch you.\u201d On which the Lamb replied, \u201cIt would be better--*aesop*",
    "for me to be sacrificed in the Temple than to be eaten by you.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Rich Man and the Tanner--*aesop*",
    "A RICH MAN lived near a Tanner, and not being able to bear the--*aesop*",
    "unpleasant smell of the tan-yard, he pressed his neighbor to go away.--*aesop*",
    "The Tanner put off his departure from time to time, saying that he would--*aesop*",
    "leave soon.--*aesop*",
    "But as he still continued to stay, as time went on, the--*aesop*",
    "rich man became accustomed to the smell, and feeling no manner of--*aesop*",
    "inconvenience, made no further complaints.--*aesop*",
    "The Shipwrecked Man and the Sea--*aesop*",
    "A SHIPWRECKED MAN, having been cast upon a certain shore, slept after--*aesop*",
    "his buffetings with the deep.--*aesop*",
    "After a while he awoke, and looking upon--*aesop*",
    "the Sea, loaded it with reproaches.--*aesop*",
    "He argued that it enticed men with--*aesop*",
    "the calmness of its looks, but when it had induced them to plow its--*aesop*",
    "waters, it grew rough and destroyed them.--*aesop*",
    "The Sea, assuming the form of--*aesop*",
    "a woman, replied to him: \u201cBlame not me, my good sir, but the winds, for--*aesop*",
    "I am by my own nature as calm and firm even as this earth; but the winds--*aesop*",
    "suddenly falling on me create these waves, and lash me into fury.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Mules and the Robbers--*aesop*",
    "TWO MULES well-laden with packs were trudging along.--*aesop*",
    "One carried--*aesop*",
    "panniers filled with money, the other sacks weighted with grain.--*aesop*",
    "The--*aesop*",
    "Mule carrying the treasure walked with head erect, as if conscious of--*aesop*",
    "the value of his burden, and tossed up and down the clear-toned bells--*aesop*",
    "fastened to his neck.--*aesop*",
    "His companion followed with quiet and easy step.--*aesop*",
    "All of a sudden Robbers rushed upon them from their hiding-places, and--*aesop*",
    "in the scuffle with their owners, wounded with a sword the Mule carrying--*aesop*",
    "the treasure, which they greedily seized while taking no notice of--*aesop*",
    "the grain.--*aesop*",
    "The Mule which had been robbed and wounded bewailed his--*aesop*",
    "misfortunes.--*aesop*",
    "The other replied, \u201cI am indeed glad that I was thought so--*aesop*",
    "little of, for I have lost nothing, nor am I hurt with any wound.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Viper and the File--*aesop*",
    "A LION, entering the workshop of a smith, sought from the tools the--*aesop*",
    "means of satisfying his hunger.--*aesop*",
    "He more particularly addressed himself--*aesop*",
    "to a File, and asked of him the favor of a meal.--*aesop*",
    "The File replied, \u201cYou--*aesop*",
    "must indeed be a simple-minded fellow if you expect to get anything from--*aesop*",
    "me, who am accustomed to take from everyone, and never to give anything--*aesop*",
    "in return.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Lion and the Shepherd--*aesop*",
    "A LION, roaming through a forest, trod upon a thorn.--*aesop*",
    "Soon afterward he--*aesop*",
    "came up to a Shepherd and fawned upon him, wagging his tail as if to--*aesop*",
    "say, \u201cI am a suppliant, and seek your aid.\u201d The Shepherd boldly examined--*aesop*",
    "the beast, discovered the thorn, and placing his paw upon his lap,--*aesop*",
    "pulled it out; thus relieved of his pain, the Lion returned into the--*aesop*",
    "forest.--*aesop*",
    "Some time after, the Shepherd, being imprisoned on a false--*aesop*",
    "accusation, was condemned \u201cto be cast to the Lions\u201d as the punishment--*aesop*",
    "for his imputed crime.--*aesop*",
    "But when the Lion was released from his cage,--*aesop*",
    "he recognized the Shepherd as the man who healed him, and instead of--*aesop*",
    "attacking him, approached and placed his foot upon his lap.--*aesop*",
    "The King, as--*aesop*",
    "soon as he heard the tale, ordered the Lion to be set free again in the--*aesop*",
    "forest, and the Shepherd to be pardoned and restored to his friends.--*aesop*",
    "The Camel and Jupiter--*aesop*",
    "THE CAMEL, when he saw the Bull adorned with horns, envied him and--*aesop*",
    "wished that he himself could obtain the same honors.--*aesop*",
    "He went to Jupiter,--*aesop*",
    "and besought him to give him horns.--*aesop*",
    "Jupiter, vexed at his request--*aesop*",
    "because he was not satisfied with his size and strength of body, and--*aesop*",
    "desired yet more, not only refused to give him horns, but even deprived--*aesop*",
    "him of a portion of his ears.--*aesop*",
    "The Panther and the Shepherds--*aesop*",
    "A PANTHER, by some mischance, fell into a pit.--*aesop*",
    "The Shepherds discovered--*aesop*",
    "him, and some threw sticks at him and pelted him with stones, while--*aesop*",
    "others, moved with compassion towards one about to die even though no--*aesop*",
    "one should hurt him, threw in some food to prolong his life.--*aesop*",
    "At night--*aesop*",
    "they returned home, not dreaming of any danger, but supposing that on--*aesop*",
    "the morrow they would find him dead.--*aesop*",
    "The Panther, however, when he had--*aesop*",
    "recruited his feeble strength, freed himself with a sudden bound from--*aesop*",
    "the pit, and hastened to his den with rapid steps.--*aesop*",
    "After a few days he--*aesop*",
    "came forth and slaughtered the cattle, and, killing the Shepherds who--*aesop*",
    "had attacked him, raged with angry fury.--*aesop*",
    "Then they who had spared his--*aesop*",
    "life, fearing for their safety, surrendered to him their flocks and--*aesop*",
    "begged only for their lives.--*aesop*",
    "To them the Panther made this reply: \u201cI--*aesop*",
    "remember alike those who sought my life with stones, and those who gave--*aesop*",
    "me food aside, therefore, your fears.--*aesop*",
    "I return as an enemy only to those--*aesop*",
    "who injured me.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Ass and the Charger--*aesop*",
    "AN ASS congratulated a Horse on being so ungrudgingly and carefully--*aesop*",
    "provided for, while he himself had scarcely enough to eat and not even--*aesop*",
    "that without hard work.--*aesop*",
    "But when war broke out, a heavily armed soldier--*aesop*",
    "mounted the Horse, and riding him to the charge, rushed into the--*aesop*",
    "very midst of the enemy.--*aesop*",
    "The Horse was wounded and fell dead on the--*aesop*",
    "battlefield.--*aesop*",
    "Then the Ass, seeing all these things, changed his mind,--*aesop*",
    "and commiserated the Horse.--*aesop*",
    "The Eagle and His Captor--*aesop*",
    "AN EAGLE was once captured by a man, who immediately clipped his--*aesop*",
    "wings and put him into his poultry-yard with the other birds, at which--*aesop*",
    "treatment the Eagle was weighed down with grief.--*aesop*",
    "Later, another neighbor--*aesop*",
    "purchased him and allowed his feathers to grow again.--*aesop*",
    "The Eagle took--*aesop*",
    "flight, and pouncing upon a hare, brought it at once as an offering to--*aesop*",
    "his benefactor.--*aesop*",
    "A Fox, seeing this, exclaimed, \u201cDo not cultivate the--*aesop*",
    "favor of this man, but of your former owner, lest he should again hunt--*aesop*",
    "for you and deprive you a second time of your wings.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Bald Man and the Fly--*aesop*",
    "A FLY bit the bare head of a Bald Man who, endeavoring to destroy it,--*aesop*",
    "gave himself a heavy slap.--*aesop*",
    "Escaping, the Fly said mockingly, \u201cYou who--*aesop*",
    "have wished to revenge, even with death, the Prick of a tiny insect, see--*aesop*",
    "what you have done to yourself to add insult to injury?\u201d The Bald Man--*aesop*",
    "replied, \u201cI can easily make peace with myself, because I know there was--*aesop*",
    "no intention to hurt.--*aesop*",
    "But you, an ill-favored and contemptible insect--*aesop*",
    "who delights in sucking human blood, I wish that I could have killed you--*aesop*",
    "even if I had incurred a heavier penalty.\u201d--*aesop*",
    "The Olive-Tree and the Fig-Tree--*aesop*",
    "THE OLIVE-TREE ridiculed the Fig-Tree because, while she was green all--*aesop*",
    "the year round, the Fig-Tree changed its leaves with the seasons.--*aesop*",
    "A--*aesop*",
    "shower of snow fell upon them, and, finding the Olive full of foliage,--*aesop*",
    "it settled upon its branches and broke them down with its weight, at--*aesop*",
    "once despoiling it of its beauty and killing the tree.--*aesop*",
    "But finding the--*aesop*",
    "Fig-Tree denuded of leaves, the snow fell through to the ground, and did--*aesop*",
    "not injure it at all.--*aesop*",
    "The Eagle and the Kite--*aesop*",
    "AN EAGLE, overwhelmed with sorrow, sat upon the branches of a tree in--*aesop*",

    "Shortly after the nuptials, the Eagle said, \u201cFly off and bring me back--*aesop*",

    "faithful fulfillment of your promise to me?\u201d The Kite replied, \u201cThat--*aesop*",

    "is, by an almost universal consent, allowed to have been born about the--*aesop*",

    "One of the privileges of a freedman in the ancient republics of--*aesop*",

    "later times, raised himself from the indignity of a servile condition--*aesop*",
    "to a position of high renown.--*aesop*",
    "In his desire alike to instruct and to be--*aesop*",
    "instructed, he travelled through many countries, and among others came--*aesop*",

    "that day, of learning and of learned men.--*aesop*",
    "He met at the court of Croesus--*aesop*",
    "with Solon, Thales, and other sages, and is related so to have pleased--*aesop*",

    "petty republics of Greece.--*aesop*",
    "At one time he is found in Corinth, and at--*aesop*",

    "It remains to state, that--*aesop*",
    "prior to this publication of M. Mezeriac, the life of Aesop was from the--*aesop*",
    "pen of Maximus Planudes, a monk of Constantinople, who was sent on an--*aesop*",
    "embassy to Venice by the Byzantine Emperor Andronicus the elder, and who--*aesop*",
    "wrote in the early part of the fourteenth century.--*aesop*",
    "His life was prefixed--*aesop*",

    "PREFACE--*aesop*",
    "THE TALE, the Parable, and the Fable are all common and popular modes--*aesop*",
    "of conveying instruction.--*aesop*",
    "Each is distinguished by its own special--*aesop*",
    "characteristics.--*aesop*",
    "The Tale consists simply in the narration of a story--*aesop*",
    "either founded on facts, or created solely by the imagination, and--*aesop*",
    "not necessarily associated with the teaching of any moral lesson.--*aesop*",
    "The--*aesop*",
    "Parable is the designed use of language purposely intended to convey--*aesop*",
    "a hidden and secret meaning other than that contained in the words--*aesop*",
    "themselves; and which may or may not bear a special reference to the--*aesop*",
    "hearer, or reader.--*aesop*",
    "The Fable partly agrees with, and partly differs--*aesop*",
    "from both of these.--*aesop*",
    "It will contain, like the Tale, a short but real--*aesop*",
    "narrative; it will seek, like the Parable, to convey a hidden meaning,--*aesop*",
    "and that not so much by the use of language, as by the skilful--*aesop*",
    "introduction of fictitious characters; and yet unlike to either Tale--*aesop*",
    "or Parable, it will ever keep in view, as its high prerogative, and--*aesop*",
    "inseparable attribute, the great purpose of instruction, and will--*aesop*",
    "necessarily seek to inculcate some moral maxim, social duty, or--*aesop*",
    "political truth.--*aesop*",
    "The true Fable, if it rise to its high requirements,--*aesop*",
    "ever aims at one great end and purpose representation of human motive,--*aesop*",
    "and the improvement of human conduct, and yet it so conceals its design--*aesop*",
    "under the disguise of fictitious characters, by clothing with speech the--*aesop*",
    "animals of the field, the birds of the air, the trees of the wood, or--*aesop*",
    "the beasts of the forest, that the reader shall receive advice without--*aesop*",
    "perceiving the presence of the adviser.--*aesop*",
    "Thus the superiority of the--*aesop*",
    "counsellor, which often renders counsel unpalatable, is kept out of--*aesop*",
    "view, and the lesson comes with the greater acceptance when the reader--*aesop*",
    "is led, unconsciously to himself, to have his sympathies enlisted in--*aesop*",
    "behalf of what is pure, honorable, and praiseworthy, and to have his--*aesop*",
    "indignation excited against what is low, ignoble, and unworthy.--*aesop*",
    "The true--*aesop*",
    "fabulist, therefore, discharges a most important function.--*aesop*",
    "He is neither--*aesop*",
    "a narrator, nor an allegorist.--*aesop*",
    "He is a great teacher, a corrector of--*aesop*",
    "morals, a censor of vice, and a commender of virtue.--*aesop*",
    "In this consists--*aesop*",
    "the superiority of the Fable over the Tale or the Parable.--*aesop*",
    "The--*aesop*",
    "fabulist is to create a laugh, but yet, under a merry guise, to convey--*aesop*",
    "instruction.--*aesop*",
    "Phaedrus, the great imitator of Aesop, plainly indicates--*aesop*",
    "this double purpose to be the true office of the writer of fables.--*aesop*",
    "The continual observance of this twofold aim creates the charm, and--*aesop*",
    "accounts for the universal favor, of the fables of Aesop.--*aesop*",
    "travestie of human affairs.--*aesop*",
    "The \u2018ainos,\u2019 as its name denotes, is an--*aesop*",
    "admonition, or rather a reproof veiled, either from fear of an excess--*aesop*",
    "of frankness, or from a love of fun and jest, beneath the fiction of an--*aesop*",
    "occurrence happening among beasts; and wherever we have any ancient and--*aesop*",
    "authentic account of the Aesopian fables, we find it to be the same.\u201d[1]--*aesop*",
    "The construction of a fable involves a minute attention to (1) the--*aesop*",
    "narration itself; (2) the deduction of the moral; and (3) a careful--*aesop*",
    "maintenance of the individual characteristics of the fictitious--*aesop*",
    "personages introduced into it.--*aesop*",
    "The narration should relate to one--*aesop*",
    "simple action, consistent with itself, and neither be overladen with a--*aesop*",
    "multiplicity of details, nor distracted by a variety of circumstances.--*aesop*",
    "The moral or lesson should be so plain, and so intimately interwoven--*aesop*",
    "with, and so necessarily dependent on, the narration, that every reader--*aesop*",
    "should be compelled to give to it the same undeniable interpretation.--*aesop*",
    "The introduction of the animals or fictitious characters should be--*aesop*",
    "marked with an unexceptionable care and attention to their natural--*aesop*",
    "attributes, and to the qualities attributed to them by universal popular--*aesop*",
    "consent.--*aesop*",
    "The Fox should be always cunning, the Hare timid, the Lion--*aesop*",
    "bold, the Wolf cruel, the Bull strong, the Horse proud, and the Ass--*aesop*",
    "patient.--*aesop*",
    "Many of these fables are characterized by the strictest--*aesop*",
    "observance of these rules.--*aesop*",
    "They are occupied with one short narrative,--*aesop*",
    "from which the moral naturally flows, and with which it is intimately--*aesop*",
    "associated.--*aesop*",
    "morals of Aesop are interwoven with his fables that distinguishes him,--*aesop*",
    "and gives him the preference over all other mythologists.--*aesop*",
    "His \u2018Mountain--*aesop*",
    "delivered of a Mouse,\u2019 produces the moral of his fable in ridicule of--*aesop*",
    "pompous pretenders; and his Crow, when she drops her cheese, lets fall,--*aesop*",
    "as it were by accident, the strongest admonition against the power of--*aesop*",
    "flattery.--*aesop*",
    "There is no need of a separate sentence to explain it; no--*aesop*",
    "possibility of impressing it deeper, by that load we too often see of--*aesop*",
    "accumulated reflections.\u201d[3] An equal amount of praise is due for the--*aesop*",
    "consistency with which the characters of the animals, fictitiously--*aesop*",
    "introduced, are marked.--*aesop*",
    "While they are made to depict the motives and--*aesop*",
    "passions of men, they retain, in an eminent degree, their own special--*aesop*",
    "features of craft or counsel, of cowardice or courage, of generosity or--*aesop*",
    "rapacity.--*aesop*",
    "These terms of praise, it must be confessed, cannot be bestowed on all--*aesop*",
    "the fables in this collection.--*aesop*",
    "Many of them lack that unity of design,--*aesop*",
    "that close connection of the moral with the narrative, that wise choice--*aesop*",
    "in the introduction of the animals, which constitute the charm and--*aesop*",
    "excellency of true Aesopian fable.--*aesop*",
    "This inferiority of some to others is--*aesop*",
    "sufficiently accounted for in the history of the origin and descent--*aesop*",
    "of these fables.--*aesop*",
    "The great bulk of them are not the immediate work of--*aesop*",
    "Aesop.--*aesop*",
    "Many are obtained from ancient authors prior to the time in which--*aesop*",
    "he lived.--*aesop*",
    "Thus, the fable of the \u201cHawk and the Nightingale\u201d is related--*aesop*",

    "traced to the monks of the middle ages: and yet this collection, though--*aesop*",
    "thus made up of fables both earlier and later than the era of Aesop,--*aesop*",

    "with the same lineaments, image, and superscription) as to secure to--*aesop*",
    "himself the right to be considered the father of Greek fables, and the--*aesop*",
    "founder of this class of writing, which has ever since borne his name,--*aesop*",
    "and has secured for him, through all succeeding ages, the position of--*aesop*",
    "the first of moralists.--*aesop*",

    "a treatise on, and converted into Latin prose, some of these fables.--*aesop*",

    "custom of common use, both in these and in later times.--*aesop*",
    "The rhetoricians--*aesop*",
    "and philosophers were accustomed to give the Fables of Aesop as an--*aesop*",

    "the Elder.--*aesop*",
    "This brought him into immediate contact with the Western--*aesop*",

    "He is--*aesop*",
    "charged on the one hand with having had before him a copy of Babrias--*aesop*",
    "this Preface), and to have had the bad taste \u201cto transpose,\u201d or to turn--*aesop*",
    "his poetical version into prose: and he is asserted, on the other hand,--*aesop*",
    "never to have seen the Fables of Aesop at all, but to have himself--*aesop*",

    "The truth lies between these two extremes.--*aesop*",
    "Planudes may have invented some few fables, or have inserted some that--*aesop*",
    "were current in his day; but there is an abundance of unanswerable--*aesop*",
    "internal evidence to prove that he had an acquaintance with the--*aesop*",
    "veritable fables of Aesop, although the versions he had access to--*aesop*",
    "were probably corrupt, as contained in the various translations and--*aesop*",
    "disquisitional exercises of the rhetoricians and philosophers.--*aesop*",
    "His--*aesop*",

    "or foundation of the earlier printed versions of Aesop, but as the--*aesop*",
    "direct channel of attracting to these fables the attention of the--*aesop*",
    "learned.--*aesop*",
    "The eventual re-introduction, however, of these Fables of Aesop to their--*aesop*",
    "high place in the general literature of Christendom, is to be looked for--*aesop*",
    "in the West rather than in the East.--*aesop*",
    "The calamities gradually thickening--*aesop*",
    "round the Eastern Empire, and the fall of Constantinople, 1453 A.D.--*aesop*",
    "combined with other events to promote the rapid restoration of learning--*aesop*",
    "in Italy; and with that recovery of learning the revival of an interest--*aesop*",
    "in the Fables of Aesop is closely identified.--*aesop*",
    "These fables, indeed,--*aesop*",
    "were among the first writings of an earlier antiquity that attracted--*aesop*",
    "attention.--*aesop*",
    "They took their place beside the Holy Scriptures and the--*aesop*",
    "ancient classic authors, in the minds of the great students of that day.--*aesop*",
    "Lorenzo Valla, one of the most famous promoters of Italian learning,--*aesop*",
    "not only translated into Latin the Iliad of Homer and the Histories of--*aesop*",
    "Herodotus and Thucydides, but also the Fables of Aesop.--*aesop*",
    "These fables, again, were among the books brought into an extended--*aesop*",
    "circulation by the agency of the printing press.--*aesop*",
    "Bonus Accursius, as--*aesop*",
    "early as 1475-1480, printed the collection of these fables, made by--*aesop*",
    "Planudes, which, within five years afterwards, Caxton translated into--*aesop*",
    "English, and printed at his press in West-minster Abbey, 1485.--*aesop*",
    "must be mentioned also that the learning of this age has left--*aesop*",
    "permanent traces of its influence on these fables,[11] by causing the--*aesop*",
    "interpolation with them of some of those amusing stories which were so--*aesop*",
    "frequently introduced into the public discourses of the great preachers--*aesop*",
    "of those days, and of which specimens are yet to be found in the--*aesop*",
    "extant sermons of Jean Raulin, Meffreth, and Gabriel Barlette.--*aesop*",
    "publication of this era which most probably has influenced these fables,--*aesop*",
    "is the \u201cLiber Facetiarum,\u201d[13] a book consisting of a hundred jests and--*aesop*",
    "stories, by the celebrated Poggio Bracciolini, published A.D. 1471, from--*aesop*",
    "which the two fables of the \u201cMiller, his Son, and the Ass,\u201d and the \u201cFox--*aesop*",
    "and the Woodcutter,\u201d are undoubtedly selected.--*aesop*",
    "The knowledge of these fables rapidly spread from Italy into Germany,--*aesop*",
    "and their popularity was increased by the favor and sanction given to--*aesop*",
    "them by the great fathers of the Reformation, who frequently used them--*aesop*",
    "as vehicles for satire and protest against the tricks and abuses of the--*aesop*",
    "Romish ecclesiastics.--*aesop*",
    "The zealous and renowned Camerarius, who took an--*aesop*",
    "active part in the preparation of the Confession of Augsburgh, found--*aesop*",
    "time, amidst his numerous avocations, to prepare a version for the--*aesop*",
    "students in the university of Tubingen, in which he was a professor.--*aesop*",
    "Martin Luther translated twenty of these fables, and was urged by--*aesop*",
    "Melancthon to complete the whole; while Gottfried Arnold, the celebrated--*aesop*",
    "Lutheran theologian, and librarian to Frederick I, king of Prussia,--*aesop*",
    "mentions that the great Reformer valued the Fables of Aesop next after--*aesop*",
    "the Holy Scriptures.--*aesop*",
    "In 1546 A.D. the second printed edition of--*aesop*",
    "the collection of the Fables made by Planudes, was issued from--*aesop*",

    "additional fables from a MS. in the Bibliotheque du Roy at Paris.--*aesop*",
    "The greatest advance, however, towards a re-introduction of the Fables--*aesop*",
    "of Aesop to a place in the literature of the world, was made in the--*aesop*",
    "early part of the seventeenth century.--*aesop*",
    "In the year 1610, a learned--*aesop*",
    "Swiss, Isaac Nicholas Nevelet, sent forth the third printed edition of--*aesop*",
    "these fables, in a work entitled \u201cMythologia Aesopica.\u201d This was a--*aesop*",
    "noble effort to do honor to the great fabulist, and was the most perfect--*aesop*",
    "collection of Aesopian fables ever yet published.--*aesop*",
    "It consisted, in--*aesop*",
    "addition to the collection of fables given by Planudes and reprinted in--*aesop*",
    "the various earlier editions, of one hundred and thirty-six new fables--*aesop*",
    "forty fables attributed to Aphthonius, and of forty-three from Babrias.--*aesop*",
    "It also contained the Latin versions of the same fables by Phaedrus,--*aesop*",

    "This volume of Nevelet forms a complete--*aesop*",
    "restoration to universal favor as one of the wise moralists and great--*aesop*",
    "teachers of mankind.--*aesop*",
    "During the interval of three centuries which has--*aesop*",
    "elapsed since the publication of this volume of Nevelet\u2019s, no book, with--*aesop*",
    "the exception of the Holy Scriptures, has had a wider circulation than--*aesop*",

    "in the common intercourse and daily conversation of the inhabitants of--*aesop*",
    "all countries.--*aesop*",
    "This collection of Nevelet\u2019s is the great culminating point in the--*aesop*",
    "history of the revival of the fame and reputation of Aesopian Fables.--*aesop*",
    "It--*aesop*",
    "is remarkable, also, as containing in its preface the germ of an idea,--*aesop*",
    "which has been since proved to have been correct by a strange chain of--*aesop*",
    "circumstances.--*aesop*",
    "Nevelet intimates an opinion, that a writer named Babrias--*aesop*",
    "would be found to be the veritable author of the existing form of--*aesop*",

    "This intimation has since given rise to a series of--*aesop*",
    "inquiries, the knowledge of which is necessary, in the present day, to a--*aesop*",
    "full understanding of the true position of Aesop in connection with the--*aesop*",
    "writings that bear his name.--*aesop*",
    "The history of Babrias is so strange and interesting, that it might--*aesop*",
    "not unfitly be enumerated among the curiosities of literature.--*aesop*",
    "He is--*aesop*",
    "generally supposed to have been a Greek of Asia Minor, of one of the--*aesop*",
    "Ionic Colonies, but the exact period in which he lived and wrote is--*aesop*",
    "yet unsettled.--*aesop*",
    "He is placed, by one critic,[14] as far back as the--*aesop*",
    "institution of the Achaian League, B.C.--*aesop*",
    "250; by another as late as the--*aesop*",
    "Emperor Severus, who died A.D. 235; while others make him a contemporary--*aesop*",
    "with Phaedrus in the time of Augustus.--*aesop*",
    "At whatever time he wrote his--*aesop*",
    "version of Aesop, by some strange accident it seems to have entirely--*aesop*",
    "disappeared, and to have been lost sight of.--*aesop*",

    "Constantinople, who lived during the latter half of the twelfth century.--*aesop*",
    "Nevelet, in the preface to the volume which we have described, points--*aesop*",
    "out that the Fables of Planudes could not be the work of Aesop, as they--*aesop*",

    "hundred years after Aesop, and from the introduction of other modern--*aesop*",
    "words, that many of these fables must have been at least committed to--*aesop*",
    "writing posterior to the time of Aesop, and more boldly suggests Babrias--*aesop*",
    "as their author or collector.--*aesop*",
    "induced Dr. Plichard Bentley, at the close of the seventeenth century,--*aesop*",
    "to examine more minutely the existing versions of Aesop\u2019s Fables, and--*aesop*",
    "he maintained that many of them could, with a slight change of words,--*aesop*",
    "be resolved into the Scazonic[17] iambics, in which Babrias is known--*aesop*",
    "to have written: and, with a greater freedom than the evidence then--*aesop*",
    "justified, he put forth, in behalf of Babrias, a claim to the exclusive--*aesop*",
    "authorship of these fables.--*aesop*",
    "Such a seemingly extravagant theory, thus--*aesop*",
    "roundly asserted, excited much opposition.--*aesop*",

    "Francesco de Furia, a learned Italian, contributed further testimony--*aesop*",

    "library several fables never before published.--*aesop*",
    "In the year 1844,--*aesop*",

    "divided into two books, the one containing a hundred and twenty-five,--*aesop*",

    "This discovery attracted very general--*aesop*",
    "attention, not only as confirming, in a singular manner, the conjectures--*aesop*",
    "so boldly made by a long chain of critics, but as bringing to light--*aesop*",
